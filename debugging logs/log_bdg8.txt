 2020-06-25 16:25:33,789 - DEBUG - completed adding to all transcripts list: ["Bowser.\n\nKing Koopa.\n\nThe authoritarian turtle with a penchant for princess-napping.\n\nHis very name strikes fear into the heart of man and mushroom alike.\n\nAnd he’s also pretty good at figure skating.\n\nBut when you focus on Bowser’s many attempts to put the Mushroom Kingdom under his rule,\n\nyou might forget that to order fuel his violent vanity projects,\n\nhe must put hundreds of henchmen into harm’s way.\n\nAnd by harm’s way, I mean in front of Mario.\n\nBut me?\n\nI never forget the troops.\n\nAnd today I’m honoring those who have put their lives on the line for a megalomaniacal turtle.\n\nToday, I’m presenting you with Bowser’s military hierarchy.\n\nI can’t go any further than that, I’m sorry.\n\n“But Brian,” I hear you ask, “Why does Bowser need a military hierarchy?”\n\nAnd folks, I hear you.\n\nI hear your questions constantly.\n\nThey come to me in my dreams like a prophet receiving visions from an angry god.\n\nBowser needs a military hierarchy because of the Geneva Conventions.\n\nY’all remember those things?\n\nThose little rules that keep you from committing war crimes?\n\nLook, I know Bowser is a bad dude, but I don’t think that Nintendo would actively create\n\na war criminal and then allow him to sit in the backseat of a go-kart with a baby.\n\nThis is thanks to how we define armed conflict.\n\nI read through the entirety of the Geneva Conventions in order to find this information,\n\nwhich turned out to be unnecessary because there is a far more succinct definition in\n\na far shorter paper.\n\nBut do I regret reading the Geneva Conventions?\n\nOf course not.\n\nKnowledge is its own reward.\n\nAnd could I really call this an Unraveled if I didn’t spend a whole day reading 224\n\npages of dense legalese for no good reason?\n\nOf course I couldn’t.\n\nOf course I couldn’t…\n\nIf Bowser wants to keep his armed conflict above board, we need to codify his aggressions.\n\nSo this means his henchmen need to follow a command structure.\n\nOne that is not at all clear cut in the games.\n\nAll we need is a list of Bowser’s troops.\n\nThat’s where this book comes in!\n\nIt’s The Super Mario Bros. Encyclopedia.\n\nThe official listing of everything you could ever want to know about the 17 games in the\n\nmain series of Super Mario Bros.\n\nThe main series are just the platformers, none of the RPGs or spin offs.\n\nBut the silver lining to this means that I can spend a different Unraveled talking about those games.\n\nBecause God has cursed me for my hubris, and my work is never finished.\n\nOf the 17 in the main series, I’m gonna cut these three games, because they don’t\n\nhave Bowser as the main antagonist.\n\nAnd I’m also gonna include Super Mario Odyssey, because that came out after this book was published.\n\nThat leaves us with 15 games and 226 enemies.\n\nI came to this number because I cut out the variants.\n\nI cut out all of the shadow versions of Mario, the minigame enemies, the enemies that are\n\njust machines, and Bowser’s fursonas.\n\nBecause those should never be exposed to the horrors of war.\n\nNow I need to figure out how to structure this hierarchy.\n\nI asked myself, is there an analogous military that is somewhat bloated, often antagonistic,\n\nand seems to be the only thing that the leadership cares about funding?\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn’t find any real life examples of this.\n\nSo I’m loosely basing it on the US military.\n\nThat means Bowser’s military **SMACK*** will be split up into branches based on which\n\nhenchmen work best together, and I’m also going to try to fit them alongside commissioned\n\nofficers and enlisted troops.\n\nThe standard command structure that’s found in most militaries.\n\nLet’s start with the heads of state: Obviously, we have Bowser up at the top, the commander in chief.\n\nHis secretary of defense is gonna be Kamek,\n\nwith Kamella standing by as the National Security Council.\n\nWe’ve also got Bowser Jr. up here, but he’s not in a military role.\n\nHe’s actually Secretary of Transportation.\n\nBut that’s just pure nepotism.\n\nThe rest of Bowser’s henchmen are going to fit into this hierarchy, and I’m just\n\ngonna say one henchman per rank, the one that epitomizes what that rank means.\n\nAnd I’m gonna list the rest of the enemies on the screen.\n\nBecause I do want to save at least a little bit of paper.\n\nUh.\n\nObviously I don’t want to save paper that much.\n\n*paper guilt*\n\nStarting with our infantry, we have our enlisted ranks with Private Goomba.\n\nThis makes sense.\n\nIt is the basic troop.\n\nMoving up a step to the corporal, we’ve got the Galoomba.\n\nIt’s more mature than the Goomba.\n\nAnd also, its name has an extra syllable and is way more fun to yell.\n\nPat: Look at this Galoomba!\n\nBrian: LOOK AT THIS GALOOMBA!\n\nChargin’ Chuck is a great pick for sergeant class, because this troop obviously enlisted\n\nright after being their high school star quarterback and moved up through the ranks quickly.\n\nAnd now that we’re up at warrant officer, the top of the enlisted ranks.\n\nWe’ve got, it’s just a tower of Goombas.\n\nKind of like the Naval Academy’s Herndon Monument, Goombas become stronger and work\n\ntogether better when they’re standing on top of one another.\n\nMoving our way up to the commissioned officers, we start out with officer cadet.\n\nAnd that’s gonna be Twirlip.\n\nIt’s got the round, soft body of a day one ROTC recruit,\n\nbut there’s ambition in those eyes.\n\nSecond lieutenant, we’ve got the Snailicorn.\n\nIt’s the natural evolution from the officer cadet, but a bit more dangerous.\n\nBy the time you’ve reached First Lieutenant, you’ve really proved your mettle and are\n\nready to show your dedication to the cause.\n\nAnd what better way to show your dedication than to be literally shot from a cannon.\n\nBy the time you reach captain, you need to have a top-down perspective.\n\nAnd that's why the Pokey's height is great for this rank.\n\nAlso, the Pokey understands how to take calculated losses in stride, like having literally all\n\nof their torso punched out from under them and still maintaining a smile.\n\nNext we have Major Squizzard, and I’m gonna gloss over him, 'cause his name makes me uncomfortable.\n\nFor lieutenant colonel, I chose Wiggler, because they're able to maintain composure and only\n\nrelease their aggression when it's absolutely necessary.\n\nBut quick shout out to Stairface Ogre, who is also a lieutenant colonel and sounds like\n\nhe could be a member of the Wu Tang Clan.\n\nNext, we have Colonel Spike.\n\nAt the colonel rank, you’re not only dealing with wartime issues, but also the internal\n\npolitics of the military,\n\nwhich is why Spike makes time to have a few rounds of tennis with the boss.\n\nA Brigadier General needs an eye for detail and a strong guiding hand.\n\nAnd that's literally all Knucklotec is.\n\nMajor Burrows really deserves the rank of major general because he has demonstrated\n\na powerful understanding of many strategies in many different battle arenas.\n\nBut more than that, he has this tender leadership quality that makes him not only respected,\n\nbut loved by his peers.\n\nAnd then above him is a fucking T-Rex.\n\nUnfortunately, even the military hierarchy is not insulated from nepotism.\n\nAnd though no one would describe Petey Piranha as capable in literally any circumstance,\n\nhis father took a bullet for Bowser back in the Korean War, so now he’s a general.\n\nAnd finally, we have our field marshall, the five-star general.\n\nObviously, this person is going to oversee every aspect of Bowser's infantry, and it\n\nhas to be filled with the most overpowered troop.\n\nSo it's Ukiki.\n\nThis shitheel of a monkey plays dumb, but he’s the Sun Tzu of Bowser’s army.\n\nListen to these quotes:\n\nAnd that is the basic structure of Bowser’s infantry, though there are also three special\n\ndivisions of infantry units that are trained to fight in different conditions.\n\nThe Lava and the Ice divisions are still found under Field Marshal Ukiki and they don't have\n\nany enlisted troops.\n\nI won't talk too much about these two, but I think they are epitomized by the Bully for\n\nthe Lava group, and the Chill Bully for the ice group, who is exactly like the Bully,\n\nexcept he'll kind of go easy on you if he can tell you're having a rough day.\n\nAnd the third special unit in the infantry is the spectral unit, or the Dry Corps, because\n\nnot even death can excuse you from service in Bowser's army.\n\nI do want to talk about the implications of this unit for a moment.\n\nSpecifically Dry Bones and Dry Bowser, whose naming conventions confuse and frighten me.\n\nWhen I die, will I become Dry Brian?\n\nIs a living Bowser...\n\nWet Bowser?\n\nWhy do Piranha Plant have bone in it?\n\nNext we have our aquatic troops.\n\nWhere can you find pleasure, search the world for treasure, learn science technology?\n\nUm.\n\nWhere can you begin to make your dreams all come true, on the land or on the sea?\n\n*SINGING* IN THE NAVY!\n\nI won’t overstay my welcome on the naval forces because we already understand what\n\neach of the ranks in the hierarchy entail.\n\nBut I did just want to point out one troop.\n\nThe Gushen.\n\nBecause its name is the Gushen.\n\nAnd I had to learn that its name was the Gushen.\n\nAnd now you need to know that it's called a Gushen as well.\n\nAnd of course, the admiral of the fleet is going to be Unagi.\n\nBecause Unagi is the most terrifying character ever rendered.\n\nGet fucked, Mr. X.\n\nNow on to the Air Force, we start with the Paragoomba at our lowest rank.\n\nAnd honestly, we're gonna skip ahead to wing commander, because most of the Air Force is\n\njust infantry but with wings attached.\n\nLakitu is our wing commander.\n\nYou might remember him as that helpful guy who picks you up in Mario Kart.\n\nBut he actually got his start in carpet bombing.\n\nAnd it might seem redundant to have Klepto as the marshal of the Air Force.\n\nBut if there's one strategy that Bowser's military understands better than anything else,\n\nit's stealing hats.\n\nAnd these are the branches of Bowser’s military.\n\nOf course, there are also Special Forces.\n\nUnits that Bowser can send in when he needs something to be done quietly and cleanly.\n\nLike when the he sent the Broodals to perform the extrajudicial killing of Professor E. Gadd.\n\nNext we've got the Bros.\n\nI'm talking the Hammer Bro, the Fire Bro, every bro in between.\n\nYou can learn more about them in the HBO series, Band of Brothers.\n\nI assume.\n\nI've never watched the show.\n\nIt’s time for the special forces called The Funny Parade!\n\nIt’s the Funny Parade!\n\nYou know about Thwomps, but did you know that there are Thwimps?\n\nAnd the Whomps have Whimps?\n\nThwimps and Thwomps and Whimps and Whomps and Grindels and Spindels and Grrrols.\n\nThere's Tox Box and Flomps and Rhomps and Bomps and Walleyes and Wallops and\n\nthey're all pretty much invincible and they will crush you without hesitation\n\nlike a cartoonish Sherman’s March to the Sea.\n\nNext, we've got the Koopalings.\n\nThey're sort of like the Seal Team 6 of Bowser's army.\n\nIggy, Larry, Lemmy, Roy, Wendy O., Ludwig Von.\n\nNotice that I did not include Morton Koopa Jr., because despite what he has written in\n\nhis memoirs, he's never actually been active duty, and he’s a valor stealing bastard.\n\nAnd the final special forces team.\n\nIt’s the Stus.\n\nStrollin’ Stu (strollin' stu).\n\nSoarin’ Stu (soarin' stu).\n\nSwipin' Stu (swipin' stu).\n\nSmolderin’ Stu (smolderin' stu).\n\n*Pat laughs offscreen.*\n\nI don’t know if they’re good at fighting\n\nbut they are good at being the best fucking characters in Mario.\n\nAnd that is every troop in Bowser’s military.\n\nExcept for these six specific ones.\n\nThey didn't really fit in the military structure.\n\nThey don't act like military.\n\nThe Koopa Troopas from Super Mario 64, they don’t even antagonize you.\n\nLike, they go about their business unless you go out of your way to attack them.\n\nSo, again, they don't even, like, feel like military.\n\nUh, they act more like civilians, to be honest.\n\n*realizing an unfortunate truth*\n\nOh my god, they’re civilians.\n\nOkay, so maybe reading the full Geneva Conventions wasn’t such an unnecessary thing after all.\n\nThere’s this thing called the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, and in\n\nArticle 8 Subsection 2, it states that grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions\n\ncount as war crimes.\n\nAnd if these Koopa Troopas are in fact not Troopas, but civilians, and Mario kills them,\n\nthen that is a direct violation of Article 8 Part 2, subsection B, 1: (i) Intentionally\n\ndirecting attacks at the civilian population...\n\nMario is a war criminal.\n\nBut that’s not the only breach, God no.\n\nSubsection A 4: Extensive destruction and appropriation of property.\n\nDestroying a brick to gain a coin.\n\nSubsection A 5, Compelling a prisoner of war... to serve in the forces of a hostile Power.\n\nWhat else could you call using Cappy to possess enemies\n\nand then forcing them to fire on their own friends?\n\nSubsection A 8, Taking of hostages.\n\nWhat was Mario doing with that penguin child?\n\nYou might think, hey, maybe Mario's just become hardened after years of onslaught\n\nby Bowser, but LOOK BACK TO MARIO’S YOUTH!\n\nI know I didn’t include Yoshi’s Island in these lists of games, but Subsection B, 21:\n\nCommitting outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment.\n\nYoshi made Burt the Bashful’s pants fall down!\n\nBut Baby Mario gave the order.\n\nHe already feels bashful!\n\nYou didn't need to pants the man!\n\nMario has committed at least 5 war crimes,\n\nand I’m not even including the child soldiers he has enlisted in the RPGs.\n\nBut luckily, I’ve already compiled an extensive PDF that I have just emailed to the Hague,\n\noutlining Mario's crimes.\n\nStill, it’s important to note that Bowser is also at fault.\n\nThe great loss of Goomba life is a tragedy, no matter which side you are on.\n\nThe true enemy is war itself.\n\nAnd to fix that, we have to turn to the only thing that’s worked in the past.\n\nSong.\n\nOne more time everyone!\n\nWe are the Toads.\n\nWe are the goombas.\n\nSo please stop jumping on each other, ya big Galoombas!\n\nWhy do we fight to take each others’ space, when there’s so mushroom to spare.\n\nWe could all have extra lives if we just share. ", ' CASTLEVANIA!\n\nOne of my favorite game series of all time.\n\nThe myriad enemies you face in Dracula’s abode are made even better knowing that they\n\ncome from real mythology and folklore.\n\nWouldn’t it be nice if there was one place you could find the FULL BESTIARY of EVERY\n\nMONSTER in Castlevania?\n\nI think that would be nice.\n\nOR AT LEAST I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE.\n\nI swear to god, the first time I started filming this video, I thought it would be an easy\n\nchange of pace.\n\nI mean, how many unique enemies could there really be in Castlevania?\n\n100?\n\n200?\n\nHow about more than 600.\n\nSo I booked 3 hours in this studio to film.\n\nAnd then we ran out of time about halfway through.\n\nSo I went out to grab some lunch, but it start to rain, so I ate a chicken sandwich drenched.\n\nThat has nothing to do with the video, I just wanted you to know my pain.\n\nSo I had to start filming all over again, this time after hours in a random meeting\n\nroom in our office building.\n\nAnd when I finished that, I had three and a half hours of footage that I was able to\n\nwhittle down into an hour long video that was very educational and extremely entertaining.\n\nJUST KIDDING.\n\nIT WAS BORING AS HELL.\n\nBut just when all hope seemed lost, I had an epiphany.\n\n“I am going to throw myself into the sea.”\n\nLuckily, before I could do that, my coworkers stopped me and convinced me that trying to\n\ncategorize all 600 Castlevania monsters was a bad idea, and instead, I could just pick the hot one.\n\nAsk yourself, why are vampires always the hot monster?\n\nIsn’t it someone else’s turn?\n\nI’m here to answer that question now that I’m filming this video for the third time.\n\nBe thankful that I’m not releasing an hour long video of me basically just lecturing\n\nyou on mythology.\n\nI mean, who knows, maybe I’ll release that video some other time.\n\nTHAT WAS A JOKE.\n\nI’M NOT GONNA DO THAT.\n\nYOU’RE GONNA HAVE TO TRUST ME.\n\nIT WAS A REALLY BAD VIDEO.\n\nSO LET’S FIND CASTLEVANIA’S MOST ELIGIBLE BACHELOR!\n\n*hot music*\n\n*lonely squeaking*\n\nLet’s cull down that list of over 600 enemies.\n\nWe’re gonna start by smooshing all of the ones with common mythologies into just one\n\nenemy, so that way we don’t have to deal with the 96 different skeletons.\n\nWe\'re also going to go ahead and cut out the evil human beings, and that includes the Belmonts that\n\nyou fight as enemies, and also all of the vampires.\n\nWe all know that Dracula is hot.\n\nWe all know that Richter Belmont is hot.\n\nI’m also going to go ahead and cut all of the enemies from Boku Dracula Kun, which was\n\njust a spinoff series, and Getsu Fuma Den enemies, which only appeared in one stage\n\nin Castlevania Harmony of Despair.\n\nAnd now it’s time to cut the animals, mythical or otherwise.\n\nLook, if they’re anthropomorphized sure, but for things like “Owl,” that’s not\n\na monster, that’s a bird.\n\nWhat about ephemera like will o’ the wisps, or inanimate objects made animate, kind of\n\nlike golems or marionettes.\n\nI went back and forth on whether or not to include these, and then I realized they creep\n\nme out, so I cut them.\n\nNow I’m going to cut out all of the gods and the god servants and the embodiments of\n\nthings like chaos and evil, because those are inherently unique.\n\nI\'m gonna cull this list a little bit more, because, let’s be honest, vampires aren’t the only monsters\n\nthat have had a taste *kiss* of that sexy limelight.\n\nWitches and warlocks, zombie, orc, treant, werewolf, mermen, gargoyle, gremlin, ghosts,\n\nMedusa, cyclops, yeti, fox archer, ogres, stained glass knight, from Young Sherlock\n\nHolmes, where he appeared as the first photorealistic CGI in any movie back in 1985.\n\nAnd finally, mummies, Brendan Fraser.\n\nWasn’t the mummy in the film, but he’s sexy enough that just by association.\n\nBut we’ve culled it down to the perfect number to figure out our sexy monster.\n\nThat’s right.\n\nWe’ve got 69 left.\n\nCan I get a WOOP?\n\nPatrick: Woo!\n\nClayton: woo.\n\nWe’ll work on it, Clayton.\n\nCriteria for what makes a sexy monster: Number one, is it replicable.\n\nI’ve already explained this, it can’t be a unique monster.\n\nAnything unique can be sexy.\n\nLook at Benedict Cumberbatch.\n\nNumber two, is it datable?\n\nCan you have a conversation with this monster?\n\nCan you bring it to Applebee’s?\n\nAnd number three, can this monster…\n\nGET IT?\n\nWe\'re gonna start with the viable ones that probably aren’t the best sex icons, like Mimic, which\n\nis kind of a veiny blob.\n\nThe Two Headed Creature.\n\nPart cyclops, part werewolf, all bad.\n\nWight, W.I.G.H.T.\n\ncomes from the old English term meaning human being.\n\nIt’s like a… just a blue zombie.\n\nNecromancers…\n\nI don’t know, they’re into weird shit.\n\nSpriggans come from Cornish faery lore, and they are described as old, wizened men with\n\nhuge childlike heads, uh, which someone’s into, I’m sure.\n\nNominon is a beast that, like, sucks the dreams out of your brains.\n\nAnd that’s not a very supportive partner.\n\nPunaguchi is just a large protruding mouth.\n\nI don’t want to know what that mouth do.\n\nThe Maneating Plant, the Wakwak Tree, and the Human Face Tree are all plants.\n\nSo if you would want to make the monster sexy, it would just… it’s just a plant.\n\nThe rug creature.\n\nUh, you never actually see what it is, it’s just always under the rug.\n\nWhich means it’s probably just like a cat.\n\nHearteater.\n\nIf you’re into bad boys.\n\nCastlevania has some of the best design in any pixel art game, except for the Towers Guardian.\n\nI don’t know what the hell this is.\n\nA ghoul isn’t necessarily a zombie, it is something that eats corpses, which is just gross.\n\nThis one’s for the sapiosexuals out there… the Brain Float.\n\nAlastor: you should be wary of anyone who builds their personality around swords.\n\nElementals are just embodiments of fire and frost.\n\nJust hard to cuddle with.\n\nThe Legend of Zeldo.\n\nIt’s just a person with scythes.\n\nThey are also known by the name “the Night Stalker,” which is a big red flag.\n\nThe Kyoma Demon hangs out in mirrors and jumps out and scares you, uh, and I don’t need\n\nanymore reason to be afraid of looking at myself in the mirror.\n\n*pensive music*\n\nMan Beast comes in two forms: twink and twunk.\n\nThey say that eye contact is important.\n\nBut maybe not this much.\n\nI do think we need a sexy skeleton, and the epitome of skeleton in this game is Yorick.\n\nYorick comes from Hamlet, the famous soliloquy “Alas, poor Yorick.”\n\nIn the Japanese version, he isn’t called Yorick, he’s called Soccer Boy.\n\nThe Imp is a mischievous sprite.\n\nAnd I was a bit worried about size differentials, but then I remembered Bee Movie, where a human\n\nwoman falls in love with a bee.\n\nJerry Seinfeld taught me that through love all things are possible.\n\nTrolls.\n\nIt’s time for someone to give them the love they deserve.\n\nThe next monster is Evil Force.\n\nAnd I want you to just go ahead and wipe away all preconceived notions.\n\nObviously, the name makes it sound bad.\n\nUh.\n\nIt also is terrible.\n\n(Pat laughs off camera).\n\nEdimmu are Mesopotamian demons that come back from the dead when they weren’t buried correctly,\n\nwhich seems like super high maintenance.\n\nThe Slaughterer apparently skips leg day.\n\nThe Arthroverta.\n\nJust a human face plastered on top of, like, an arthropod. I dunno, maybe?\n\nChon Chon, or the Bitterfly, comes from Chile.\n\nIt’s about Mapuche wizards that turn into this thing.\n\nKind of like vampires turning into bats.\n\nIt’s a neat talent.\n\n*revealing my true Chon Chon form*\n\nThe Killer Mantle.\n\nComes from an urban legend in Japan about Aka Manto, which is a spirit that lives in\n\ntoilets and then asks you if you want red or blue toilet paper.\n\nRed, they’ll stab you in the back a bunch, and blue, they’ll strangle you till you\n\nturn blue.\n\nI’m just not into toilet stuff.\n\nI mean most of these monsters are pretty okay.\n\nUm, they’re not the… they’re not like the most.\n\nSURPRISE!\n\nI LULLED YOU INTO A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY!\n\nIt’s time for a minigame I like to call, “If I were a Castlevania game... what title\n\nwould I be?”\n\nTake your birth month, and that’s the first part of the title.\n\nOF.\n\nAnd your birth date is the second part.\n\nMy title would be Castlevania: Sonata of the Eclipse.\n\nAll of these games sound the same.\n\nWe’re halfway through the viable enemies.\n\nWe’ve got 35 monsters that I think are pretty good options.\n\nWe’re gonna start with the monsters that are supposed to be sexy, so it feels kind\n\nof unfair to use them as the sexy monsters.\n\nLorelai, Lilith, and all of the succubi, Harpys, Headhunter, Arachnes, Dryads, Rusalka, and Naiads.\n\nI’m just putting these ones all around the sides.\n\nThe demons.\n\nThe ones with the horns and the wings and they’re really ripped and muscular.\n\nMothman.\n\nEveryone thinks the Mothman is pretty sexy.\n\nAlthough this Jersey Devil depiction looks just kind of like a horse with wings, uh,\n\nthe actual Jersey Devil comes from an idea of a woman who cursed her 13th child, being like,\n\n“UGH GOD I GOTTA HAVE ANOTHER BABY.”\n\nAnd then it came out and it grew like a goat’s face and wings, and I just think we need to\n\nstart thinking of New Jersey in general as sexier.\n\nAnd this might be the way to do that.\n\nThe Minotaur.\n\nYou gotta work through that labyrinth, but once you get in there and find the real Minotaur,\n\nhe might kill you.\n\nBut, he also might open up and be really lovely.\n\nThe Chupacabra is an impish little fella.\n\nFirst sighted in Puerto Rico and is known throughout lots of Latin America.\n\nHis name translates to goat sucker.\n\nDo I have to explain why...\n\nThe Fomorians are personifications of chaos and other evil ideas in Irish folklore.\n\nUm, and they\'re these goat people, uh, and they\'re ripped as hell.\n\nLizard Man.\n\nIf you don\'t know why I\'m putting this here.\n\n*COME ON*\n\nYou gotta go what my Skyrim video.\n\nBanshee comes from Irish folklore and will foretell the death of someone you know.\n\nIt\'s a bit spooky.\n\nIt\'s also super emotionally available.\n\nYou won\'t have to worry about what the Banshee is thinking.\n\nThey will tell you when they\'re upset.\n\nAnd also when your parents are gonna die.\n\nSlogra.\n\nDoesn\'t have a folklore or mythology associated with it.\n\nI got nothing for ya.\n\nIf you\'re not attracted to this, you\'re wrong.\n\nBecause the Rycuda only exists in Castlevania, it means that there\'s... very specific artwork\n\nthat you can find of it.\n\nVery modern artwork has been made about the Rycuda, which proves it can be sexy.\n\nDullahan is an Irish faery that is like a headless horseman sort of character, it\'s\n\nalso another portent of death, but can you think about all the cool Spider-Man kisses\n\nyou can do with that?\n\nThe Jiang Shi is the Qing dynasty version of a vampire.\n\nKeremet comes out when you bang on his pot a couple times.\n\nIt\'s a good face, right?\n\nI could talk to that thing for hours.\n\nThere are so many armors in Castlevania.\n\nNo one can turn down a man in uniform.\n\nOr a poltergeist in uniform.\n\nOr literally just an enchanted uniform.\n\nUGHHHHHHH MOTHER OF PEARL I forgot about goblins.\n\nEveryone forgets about goblins though, so I\'ll put \'em over here!\n\nI also forgot about Siren, that\'s another thing that\'s sexy and draws people in.\n\nHow did I skip so many of these?\n\nThe Guillotiner doesn\'t look like much, could be a problem, but it\'s time for us to bring it back.\n\nSlime.\n\nThere are already things online.\n\nThe Tsuchinoko is a Japanese cryptid that is a snake that is fatter in its middle than\n\non its head or its tail.\n\nPat (off camera): I just don\'t see why it\'s sexy.\n\nYou don\'t...\n\nPatrick, you gotta understand.\n\nIt\'s not about what you could first see, right?\n\nPat: I mean, but even after that, what do you see after that?\n\nIt has a propensity for lying and for drinking alcohol.\n\nPatrick thinks it shouldn\'t be this high on the list, but fuck Patrick.\n\nWe\'re at the top five.\n\nBut before we get there, um, I have a confession to make.\n\nI\'ve kept six monsters that don\'t even fit my criteria, but I love them so much that\n\nI think they deserve a chance.\n\nFirst up is a unique character, it\'s Nergal Meslamstea.\n\nThe reason I think he deserves a chance is because is because someone named him Nergal\n\nMeslamstea.\n\nOf course he\'s gonna be fucking evil if you name your child...\n\nWhy, what is up with people in Castlevania naming their children dumb shit?\n\nSeriously, Alucard?\n\nDracula, you can\'t just name your child your name backwards.\n\nI\'m not gonna name my son Nairb.\n\nScary Candle.\n\nIt\'s an inanimate object that is made animate, but I fucking love candles.\n\nNext two I think are pretty self explanatory: Bone Pillar.\n\nAnd if that doesn\'t make you happy, how \'bout the Bone Dragon?\n\nThis next one is a ghost, and I\'ve already explained why that one shouldn\'t be included\n\nin this, but I had to because the ghost\'s name is Duke Mirage.\n\nAnd if someone comes up to me and introduces themself to me as Duke Mirage,\n\nmy pants are already off.\n\nFinally, I know I nixed all animals.\n\nBut I really do think we should include Hyena with gun.\n\nThat hyena can GET IT.\n\nWe\'re at the top five.\n\nThe Malebranche come from Dante\'s Divine Comedy.\n\nThey\'re all unique demons that are used to help keep corrupt politicians under boiling\n\npits of tar in Hell.\n\nThey all have great names like Cagnazzo and Scarmiglione, which was translated into the\n\nEnglish version as Skull Millione, which is just a Soundcloud rapper.\n\nThey\'re already mischievous, and they hate corrupt politicians.\n\nWe can get behind that.\n\nThe Myconid is a sentient race of mushroom people.\n\nWe have anthropomorphized animalia, why not anthropomorphized fungi?\n\nWhen I was a kid, my mom thought that I had a nutritional deficit because I kept wanting\n\nto eat mushrooms so much, like I ate only mushrooms for like a whole week.\n\nThat has nothing to do with this.\n\nI know I took out all of the werewolf creatures, uh, but this one isn\'t that.\n\nThis is the Princess of Moss.\n\nThe human version is based off of\n\nPFBRRRRRRRR UHM OFF WITH THE-ERRR Let them eat cake?\n\n(Pat: Mary Antoinette) Mary Antoinette.\n\nI think we should have more moth creatures in our movies.\n\nRight?\n\nThey\'re already drawn towards the limelight.\n\nIt\'s an Ukoback.\n\nWhy is this the second sexiest monster from Castlevania?\n\nI\'ll tell you why.\n\nHe carries around a hot thing of coals in a spoon, and is also responsible not only\n\nfor fried foods, but fireworks.\n\nHELL YES.\n\nWhat a cool dude!\n\nI think Ukobacks could be real sexy, right?\n\nWhat is more sexy than feeding someone with a lovely fried dish?\n\nAnd finally, the thing that I think should be new sexy monster.\n\nThe Mandrake.\n\nOr the Alura Une.\n\nBasically, any sort of plant person.\n\nAlura Une actually comes from a 1911 book called "Alraune."\n\nIt\'s a German story.\n\nI just think that this kind of gives you a blank slate on something, sure this, this\n\nthing is born from the ground where hanged men bleed, which is spooky, and scary, but\n\nit\'s not their fault!\n\nRight?\n\nYou know, they didn\'t choose to be born.\n\nWho does choose to be born?\n\nRight?\n\nWho chooses...\n\nThe metaphors of how our family raises us, you know, the mandrake is a perfect idea of\n\nsomething that can become greater than its original circumstances.\n\n*SIGH* So there you go.\n\nThe full bestiary of the sexy monsters.\n\nAgain, couldn\'t give you the full full bestiary, because that took me way too long.\n\nAnd if you\'ll excuse me, I\'m going to go throw myself into the ocean now.\n\nI CAN\'T DO THAT.\n\nI KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE COLD BUT I DIDN\'T THINK IT WAS GOING TO BE THAT COLD.\n\nMake sure to like this video and subscribe to Polygon if you want to see more Unraveled,\n\nand go ahead and leave a comment of your new Castlevania title.\n\nMaybe that\'ll convince them to make a new game. ', ' Welcome to Unraveled Season 2!\n\nYou can tell it’s a new season because I’ve grown a mustache and cut my hair.\n\nOhoho I’m obviously just kidding.\n\nThese are both fake.\n\nI know how much it would disappoint my friends if I changed my appearance.\n\nI\'m just kidding again.\n\nI\'m not your friend, and you have no say over what I do with my body.\n\nAnd speaking of harsh realities...\n\nThe world of Dark Souls is frightening and murky.\n\nHow can you truly understand Dark Souls lore without living Dark Souls?\n\nGrinding away tirelessly in inhospitable environments, under uncharitable overlords.\n\nTo truly understand Dark Souls lore, you must first understand the desolation of…\n\nWorking at a job!\n\nHave you ever thought about the term Boss in a video game before?\n\nThose terrible enemies have the same title as the people you’ll be working for\n\nfor the rest of your life!\n\nHaha, what a silly coincidence!\n\nDark Souls is known for wildly difficult bosses that prove themselves on the battlefield,\n\nbut can they prove themselves in a more difficult setting:\n\nthe Lordran Hills Business Park and Commerce Center!\n\nIt’s across from the mall.\n\nToday, I’m ranking every Dark Souls boss based on how good they’d be as a manager.\n\nI\'m not dancing this season.\n\nWelcome to the Dark Souls Corp. onboarding seminar.\n\nNow I\'m only going to be speaking about the Dark Souls 1, 2, and 3 bosses.\n\nNo other “Soulsborne” games.\n\nI was originally thinking about putting in the Demon\'s Souls, but they actually got integrated\n\ninto the Dark Corporation in a very messy merger.\n\nAll of the managers got sacked.\n\nSo we\'re not talking about them.\n\nThat leaves us with 96 Dark Souls bosses and minibosses.\n\nAnd it leads us to the difficult part of our journey, how do we objectively answer the\n\nsubjective question: “What makes a good boss?”\n\nSo I started researching lists of “the x qualities of a good boss” on places like\n\nLinkedIn and Forbes, and then I fell down the rabbit hole of the hundreds of corporate blogs.\n\nAnd at the end of this journey, I realized... it didn\'t matter at all.\n\nWhat does matter is making a catchy, powerpointable mnemonic device.\n\nSo here are the Five Cs that make a good boss:\n\nNumber one, clear vision.\n\nCan this boss communicate their goals, give clear steps on how to achieve those goals.\n\nDoes this boss clearly hold their big old arm way up in the air before slamming it down on you?\n\nNumber two, consistent feedback.\n\nIt’s important for a boss to let you know that you’ve made a mistake, like challenging\n\nSeath the Scaleless before putting on your ring of sacrifice, you absolute fool.\n\nYou child.\n\nNumber three, cherishes employees.\n\nA good boss values employee perspectives and rewards good performance.\n\nLike when a boss decides to die when you hit it in a good way.\n\nNumber four, compassionate leadership.\n\nHonest. Trusting.\n\nWorthy of respect from their employees.\n\nThe kind of boss you could chat with at the Estus cooler.\n\nAnd the fifth and final C. Can really just go to town on a motherfucker.\n\nSlices.\n\nDices.\n\nBig old crunchers.\n\nSomeone who’s willing to do what needs to be done when the going gets tough.\n\nOr someone who reveals an abyssal dragon that they’ve been keeping under their armor this whole time.\n\nThis is our main criteria for what makes a good boss.\n\nBut for 96 bosses, it\'s gonna be hard to differentiate their management style with just these five Cs.\n\nWhich is why I’m introducing the HR index.\n\nIf they\'re over here, they get a lot of HR compliments.\n\nIf they\'re down here, they get a lot of HR complaints.\n\nLet’s be honest, some really well-loved bosses are very bad leaders, and some really good leaders\n\nare SKEEZY AS HELL.\n\nSo let\'s rank some DARK SOULS BOOOOOSSEEEEEEEEES.\n\nHere\'s our scale.\n\nWe\'re gonna start out with the neutrals.\n\nThey\'re the standard boss, so I\'m just gonna skim through them.\n\nGuardian Dragon, The Pursuer, Old Demon King, Demon of Song.\n\nIf you\'re watching this video and you see yourself exhibiting these lackluster tendencies,\n\nI want you to ask yourself: What can I do to be better than the Royal Rat Authority,\n\nwho vomits acid all over the floor multiple times a day and is still considered a pretty\n\nokay boss.\n\nAim higher.\n\nLet\'s talk about the pushovers!\n\nNow, these are like my favorite substitute teacher in high school, Mr. S,\n\nwho would go off on class-long tangents about his youth traveling the world\n\ninstead of teaching us about Lord of the Flies.\n\nI loved Mr. S.\n\nObjectively a terrible teacher, though.\n\nChampion\'s Gravetender and Gravetender Greatwolf.\n\nThis guy’s so fun!\n\nHe brought his dog into work!\n\nI love dogs!\n\nLiterally nothing\'s going to get done today.\n\nVordt of the Boreal Valley.\n\nHe runs around on all fours.\n\nHe\'s really disrupting the “walking” space.\n\nIt’s very ineffective.\n\nIron Golem.\n\nHe’s sweet, sort of bumbling, and you’ve asked him to approve your expense reports\n\nlike five times already.\n\nAava, Lud, and Zallen, the King\'s Pets.\n\nLiterally baked into the title, they\'re teacher\'s pets.\n\nThey suck up to the king.\n\nSeath the Scaleless is a real sweetheart, but he is very risk averse.\n\nAnd if you destroy his crystal, he becomes mortal, and takes it, like, really personally.\n\nThe Fume Knight.\n\nHe’s got two sides, two swords.\n\nLook, he\'s still got his old sword back when he had your job.\n\nBut eventually he is gonna get rid of that sword.\n\nHe\'s gonna be a real asshole about it.\n\nThe Lost Sinner.\n\nShe, and I quote, “eternally punishes herself for the sins of her past.”\n\nIt’s important to have a boss that recognizes their flaws, but it\'s bad if your boss locks\n\nherself in the conference room and flogs herself eternally.\n\nI booked the conference room for three, I need to get in there.\n\nCrossbreed Priscilla goes invisible at the first sign of conflict.\n\nThat\'s not showing up for the company.\n\nLorian and Lothric the princes.\n\nOne of them hangs around the other one\'s neck of the other one, who\'s actually doing all the work.\n\nWhich is the worst form of micromanaging.\n\nThe Four Kings.\n\nYou don\'t fight all four at once.\n\nYou fight one and then the rest come in slowly.\n\nWhich is kind of like every group project you had in high school.\n\nThe Carthus Sand Worm.\n\nIf you ignore them, they\'ll ignore you, and some people like that managing style.\n\nBut also if you stand on the sideline for long enough, someone else will shoot big arrows\n\ninto them and then they\'ll die.\n\nAnd that\'s a bad boss.\n\nThe Dragonslayer Armour is actually just a puppet for these big wiry dragon butterfly things.\n\nSo they\'re well-loved by the higher ups, but only because they don\'t have any ideas on their own.\n\nThe Ancient Wyvern is the epitome of pushover.\n\nBecause you can just run through his stage and then kill him with one attack at the very end.\n\nThis is perfect for the employee that likes to, you know, fuck around on Reddit all day\n\nand then send one email at five and then peace out.\n\nI don\'t know what that\'s like.\n\nI\'ve never done that.\n\nAnd finally, this is sort of a technical pushover.\n\nIt\'s the Ruin Sentinels.\n\nThey\'re kind of like a board of directors in that they all look the same and do the\n\nsame thing, which is to say not a lot.\n\nBut you gotta suck up to them if you want to get anywhere in the company.\n\nNow we\'re gonna flip to the opposite side of the scale.\n\nWe\'re gonna talk about the sketchies.\n\nThese have a powerful understanding of corporate leadership...\n\nbut everyone hates them.\n\nThe Boreal Outrider Knight is a miniboss, but like, you can tell he really wants to be a boss.\n\nNashandra tricks you into opening the Throne of Want even though she just wants it for herself.\n\nBut manipulation gets you pretty far in business.\n\nThe Burnt Ivory King only comes to fight you after you kill literally all of his knights.\n\nHe gets it done, sure, but only when he needs to.\n\nDragonrider.\n\nThis dude doesn\'t have a dragon.\n\nHis job title is obviously false.\n\nIt\'s like if I got promoted to "Guy who had an okay time in high school."\n\nBed of Chaos.\n\nActually a very effective leader, but every time you have to have\n\na "Meeting with the Bed of Chaos,"\n\nsomeone in HR gets an email.\n\nCentipede Demon.\n\nHe nasty.\n\nManus, the Father of the Abyss.\n\nAlways screaming at me.\n\nBad anger management.\n\nHigh Lord Wolnir has a lot of gold jewelry.\n\nVery ostentatious.\n\nAll of his plans sound more like schemes,\n\nBUT!\n\nHe does know the bassist for Maroon 5 and they\'ve been looking for someone with like\n\nreally good hand dexterity and he\'s noticed that you\'ve got something good so if you want...\n\nMytha, the Baneful Queen doesn\'t really have an understanding of personal boundaries.\n\nShe\'s kind of like that coworker who, instead of sending an email,\n\njust peeks their head over the cubicle wall.\n\nExcept in this case that head is severed from the body and will explode.\n\nPinwheel can summon an unlimited amount of clones.\n\nMost bosses wish they could be everywhere at once.\n\nThis one can be.\n\nSlave Knight Gael came into the company with you, was a really good friend, and then he\n\ngot promoted over you, and he\'s been a real jerk since.\n\nAldia, Scholar of the First Sin is constantly testing you, because he sees great things in you.\n\nBut dude, not everything has to be a test.\n\nThis is a Game Stop.\n\nAldrich, Devourer of Gods has a bunch of skeletons strewn about his clothes, and those are the\n\npeople he ate on his way to the top.\n\nWhich is incredibly cutthroat, but at least he’s honest about it.\n\nPontiff Sulyvahn has two swords: a profane flame and a sword of judgment.\n\nAnd he hits you with both of them.\n\nHe\'s the type of guy who sends you an NSFW link at work\n\nand then reports you for clicking on it.\n\nDragon Slayer Ornstein and Executioner Smough get shit DONE.\n\nThey are a power couple...\n\nthat isn\'t sanctioned by HR.\n\nThey didn\'t fill out the paperwork.\n\nIt makes everyone very uncomfortable.\n\nThere is a LOT of PDA.\n\nAnd it is weird.\n\nNow let\'s move on to the good category, with the Old Dragonsl...\n\nTHIS IS JUST ORNSTEIN AGAIN.\n\nTHIS DUDE JUST PUT ON A DIFFERENT SUIT AND TRIED TO GET REHIRED IN THE OGDEN BRANCH.\n\nThat\'s not gonna fly!\n\nY’all ready for the stinkers?\n\nYou thought we had some pretty bad bosses up to this point, but we haven\'t even hit\n\nthe depths of bad bossery.\n\nWe\'re about to hit the Blighttown of HR.\n\nVendrick.\n\nDude, you gotta wear more than a loincloth to work.\n\nChaos Witch Quelaag and Scorpioness Najka are nude from the waist up...\n\nand nude from the waist down.\n\nY\'all, we have leftover shirts from the softball game, can you just go into the bathroom and\n\nput one of those on, please?\n\nOld Iron King is constantly working from home and he signs all of his emails,\n\n"Sent from my hot tub."\n\nGET OUT OF THE HOT TUB!\n\nCeaseless Discharge.\n\nThe name alone tells me you should have taken a sick day.\n\nOceiros, the Consumed King is always going on about his son Ocelotte,\n\nshowing you pictures of him and his rowing team.\n\nYou KNOW that this psych major is gonna replace you as soon as he graduates Yale.\n\nAsylum Demon, Stray Demon, Demon Firesage all have a move called butt slam.\n\n*camera nods in agreement*\n\nLooking Glass Knight.\n\nReflects everyone\'s flaws back on them, doesn\'t look inward enough.\n\nCurse-rotted Greatwood.\n\nAnother dress code violation.\n\nGwyn, Lord of Cinder is kept around because he was the founder and made a lot of money\n\non Wall Street in the \'80s, but he’s hollow inside.\n\nThe Covetous Demon is always taking credit for the work that you\'re doing.\n\nAnd he steals your lunch from the fridge every day, even though I label it, DAVE.\n\nAbyss Watchers.\n\nInfighting is a very dangerous thing for a group of managers.\n\nThe Crystal Sage does a little bit of work, and then vanishes, and then does a little bit more work,\n\nand then vanishes, and then you see them on their instagram story at some beer garden.\n\nSister Friede is actually a very good boss, and should be up here, but unfortunately\n\nshe\'s the assistant to Father Ariandel\n\nwho is SO incompetent he can\'t untie a chair from his ass.\n\nAnd finally, the worst boss...\n\nThe Gaping Dragon.\n\nUnder no circumstances should you be in a work setting\n\nand described as gaping.\n\nAll that\'s left is the top right of this scale, the good bosses, but before we get there,\n\nthere are a few bosses that don\'t really fit into the standard "boss/employee" structure,\n\nor they\'re basically corporations in their own right, so we\'ll talk about them as alternatives.\n\nThe Bell and the Belfry Gargoyles only come in when someone else is hurting.\n\nSo they\'re kind of like consultants.\n\nHalflight, Spear of the Church could actually be a real-life human player.\n\nAnd pitting employees against each other is a big no-no.\n\nThe Royal Rat Vanguard is one boss rat that\'s surrounded by a horde of indistinguishable other rats,\n\nso it\'s just an episode of Undercover Boss.\n\nAfflicted Graverobber, Ancient Soldier Varg, and Cerah the Old Explorer are a trio that...\n\nlike, they\'re just high school friends that decided to get together and open a burger joint,\n\nand they\'re kind of incompetent but you love them anyway.\n\nThe Prowling Magus and Congregation is a startup because it\'s one charismatic weirdo who takes\n\ncredit for all of the hardworking people around them.\n\nWe\'ve got some unions!\n\nA good union would be the Skeleton Lords.\n\nIt\'s three lords and a bunch of minions who are recognized and working together toward\n\nthe same goal.\n\nThat\'s a good thing.\n\nA worse union is the Deacons of the Deep, where the management only comes in\n\nafter five of their employees are killed.\n\nFinally, we have the Executioner\'s Chariot, whose employees are trying to unionize,\n\nbut they keep getting trampled.\n\nAnd that leaves us with the good ones.\n\nThere are only 13 of them.\n\nThe Flexile Sentry.\n\nGreat multitasker.\n\nThe Taurus Demon gives you the tools you need to succeed, and encourages you to climb that ladder,\n\nso that way you can jump down and hit him on the head.\n\nGravelord Nito has a lot of skeleton friends.\n\nA very good delegator.\n\nThe Duke\'s Dear Freja.\n\nYeah, she\'s a big spider...\n\nbut she\'s the Duke\'s DEAR Freja!\n\nThe Duke loves her!\n\nWhen has the Duke led you astray before?\n\nCome on, man!\n\nThe Duke loves her!\n\nGive her a chance!\n\nPat (offscreen): Do it for the Duke!\n\nDo it for the Duke!\n\nSinh, the Slumbering Dragon and the Last Giant are slow, deliberate, and they keep on going\n\neven though they got a big fucking spear through \'em.\n\nElana, the Squalid Queen summons friends when things get a bit too much for her.\n\nThat’s good delegation and understanding your limits.\n\nThe Ancient Dragon doesn\'t actually fight you until you fight them, you can just have\n\na chat with this boss, and honestly, that\'s good enough sometimes.\n\nGreat Grey Wolf Sif is a big wolf with a sword.\n\nFUCK YEAH!\n\nThe Nameless King and the King of the Storm.\n\nNow, when the King of the Storm takes enough damage,\n\nthe Nameless King will put them out of their misery.\n\nAnd it\'s very sad, but it\'s also what needed to be happen.\n\nThat\'s good management.\n\nI fully expect my boss, Tara Long, to put me out of my misery when I stop being useful.\n\nThe Soul of Cinder.\n\nIf you kill him, you might become him.\n\nAnd that\'s a very clear path to promotion.\n\nIt’s not a great path to promotion, but it is a clear one.\n\nThe Throne Watcher and Defender are another power couple, but they filled out the HR paperwork.\n\nAnd they work great together!\n\nThey\'re super professional about it.\n\nThey constantly revive the other one when they die, and that\'s a good boss.\n\nAlso, relationship goals.\n\nAnd finally, the best business boss in Dark Souls...\n\nis The Rotten.\n\nBecause this company is employee owned.\n\nEvery movement is made by the collective.\n\nEveryone gets a say.\n\nNow you might think you are small, and insignificant,\n\nand also dead.\n\nBut!\n\nWhen you smash together everyone’s stinky, rotting corpse, you can move mountains together.\n\nThe best boss is you.\n\nAnd all of your dead friends.\n\nAnd in the Dark Souls Corporation, that means you need a job description.\n\nSo go ahead and use this handy chart to figure out your Dark Souls boss title.\n\nAnd that concludes our onboarding seminar.\n\nMake sure to print out your completion certificate at the end of this video\n\nso you can send it to your manager.\n\nHappy managing, and praise the sun!\n\nUnder no circumstances should you be in a work setting and described as gaping.\n\nPat (offscreen): Hey, yo, can I gape in here?\n\nBrian (offscreen, laughing): You guys mind if I gape?\n\nAnd that concludes our onboarding seminar.\n\nMake sure to celebroderadfjoisfjid.\n\n(Pat cracking up offscreen). ', ' E3.\n\nThe Electronic Entertainment Expo.\n\nWhat began as a humble video game industry trade show has blossomed into something more\n\nspectacular.\n\nMore flamboyant.\n\nMore… of whatever this is.\n\nE3 is a chance to show off new games and the theatrical chops of your executives.\n\nBecause that’s what E3 really is now.\n\nIt’s theater.\n\nIt’s like Cats the musical but with more guns and a better plot line.\n\nBut this E3 is different.\n\nA lot of companies are ditching the press conference altogether, and those companies\n\nare cowards.\n\nSony isn’t even showing up to E3 this year!\n\nAnd it’s not because they lack things to say.\n\nIt’s because they have forgotten how to say it.\n\nThe industry has lost its way.\n\nThat’s why I’ll be giving them the 10 keys to creating a perfect E3 presentation,\n\nand then I’ll be giving you the perfect E3 presentation.\n\nIt’s theatre, baby!\n\nThe first step is throwing away everything you know about public speaking, because E3\n\npresentations are a beast of their own.\n\nYou have to watch them to learn from them.\n\nYou might ask, "Brian, wouldn’t learning from old E3s keep you in the rut of old thinking,\n\nmaking the same mistakes that past business geniuses have made?"\n\nNo.\n\nAnd that brings us to the board.\n\nI have watched hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours of E3\n\npresentations and I have analyzed what makes them compelling.\n\nI’ve distilled the essence of E3 down into 10 simple keys.\n\nIf you include these 10 keys, you will create the perfect E3 presentation.\n\nAnd if you, like most people, aren’t putting on an E3 press conference, then you could\n\npotentially use these 10 keys for like a drinking game or something, I’m not saying you should\n\ndo that, I’m saying it’s y… it’s possible.\n\nYou could do that if you wanted t… it’s not…\n\nI did that, okay?\n\nYou can use these for the drinking game.\n\nThe first key: A weirdly high-budget opener.\n\nIt is essential to start the presentation with high energy, and it’s essential to\n\ndo it in such a way as to make the audience say,\n\n“Hmm yeah wow they really paid for that, huh?”\n\nSony used to be great at this, starting 2016’s E3 with an entire orchestra playing the God\n\nof War theme, and then last year they started E3 with an entire banjo player.\n\nWeird thing to spend money on.\n\nBut both of these intros still get BONUS POINTS, because they started with a live musical number.\n\nThe second key is for the presenter.\n\nThey have the unenviable task of connecting with a notoriously difficult audience.\n\nHow can they reach the fickle gamer while still maintaining business poise?\n\nBusiness Gamer Fashion.\n\nBusiness Gamer Fashion is an outfit that is professional, and yet still conveys the idea\n\nthat this person could be seen sitting on a couch for 14 hours at a time.\n\nIt says, “I’m one of you…\n\nbut I’m also way richer than you.”\n\nBut the BONUS POINTS go to the one true business gamer fashion:\n\nill-fitting blazer,\n\ndiesel jeans,\n\ngamer t-shirt.\n\nThe third key is set dressing.\n\nThis has to be theatrical, which is to say, inappropriate for a trade show.\n\nTake a look at Sony’s weird barn church.\n\nIt was like an immersive theatrical experience, but with the 10-minute scene transitions of\n\na high school production of Les Mis.\n\nBut the BONUS POINTS go to live, human set pieces, like, I don\'t know, hanging bodies\n\nfrom the ceiling that FLAIL AROUND when a character moves through them on the screen.\n\nThere’s that classic Sony magic!\n\nI want to remind people that E3 is a trade show.\n\nAnd this is kind of like if Disney held a press conference about the Avengers and then\n\nDISINTEGRATED A MAN LIVE ON STAGE.\n\nNow we’re moving into the meat and potatoes of the presentation with key number four:\n\nNumbers.\n\nVideo Games are just programs and programs are just numbers and for some reason, gamers\n\nlove it when numbers are big.\n\nA few good numbers to say are polygon count, amount of enemies on screen, RAM?\n\nMaybe?\n\nI don\'t know, who gives a shit!?\n\nHonestly, BONUS POINTS go to saying a number that\'s completely devoid of context.\n\nBecause numbers mean…\n\nINNOVATION.\n\nKey number 5.\n\nMore specifically... less specifically.\n\nI need this to be the vaguest discussion ever.\n\nI need you to make claims about how you’re doing something that’s never been done before\n\nand then not tell us what you\'re doing.\n\nHere’s a list of innovative words and phrases.\n\nIt’s the presenter’s job to say each and every one of these.\n\nBut the BONUS POINTS go to the purest form of expressing innovation.\n\nLooking up at the screen behind you, looking back at the audience, and saying…\n\n“Wow.”\n\nKey number six is the game trailer montage.\n\nYou’ve probably never heard of these games before.\n\nYou might never hear of them again, but the BONUS POINTS go to the game trailer montage\n\nthat comes at the end of the presentation, which is just showing you everything you\'ve\n\nseen so far set to an Arcade Fire soundalike.\n\nThese six keys are the foundation of a solid E3 presentation.\n\nYou hit these six, you’re in the clear.\n\nBut you haven’t achieved perfection yet.\n\nBut before we get into the final four, let’s talk about the notable absences.\n\nThese are anti-keys, things you’ll never see in an E3 presentation.\n\nI got a list of them here…\n\nOh what’s this, it’s just a single entry that says “A legitimate discussion about\n\nhow to address the crunch crisis that\'s prevalent in nearly every game studio.”\n\nWell I guess we don\'t need these anymore!\n\n*wild laughter*\n\n*frightening laughter*\n\n*pained laughter*\n\n*pain*\n\nAnd now, it\'s time for the final four keys.\n\nThese are the Truly Special Moments.\n\nThey’re hard to build in, but they turn a good presentation into a transcendent one.\n\nKey number seven: A “WHYW” game.\n\nThis is an acronym that stands for “What? Hell yeah! What!?”\n\nand it\'s used for a game that makes you go,\n\n“What?\n\nHell Yeah!\n\nWHAT!?”\n\nOften these are for games that are totally independent, but the best ones are for weird\n\nentries into beloved franchise, like the Final Fantasy XV VR Fishing Game.\n\nEven now, when someone tells me there’s a Final Fantasy XV VR Fishing Game, I go What? HELL YEAH! WHAT!?\n\nBut the BONUS POINTS... you know what, actually, no.\n\nYou only get bonus points if you make a VR fishing game for a beloved franchise.\n\nI want to watch the Doomslayer catch a bass.\n\nBut sometimes, the presenter has a WHYW moment.\n\nThat’s why key eight is heartfelt emotion.\n\nGenuine excitement about a game, joy, sadness.\n\nThis has to happen naturally.\n\nHonestly, if I’m having a rough day, I will go back and watch the video of Ubisoft developer\n\nDavide Soliani crying after Shigeru Miyamoto compliments him onstage, because that is the\n\nrealest and most joyful moment.\n\nHonestly, who wouldn’t burst out crying if Shigeru Miyamoto, the architect of many\n\nof our childhoods, complimented them?\n\nYou know, that, that tiny thing... that reminder that these people behind the games are human\n\nbeings and can be emotionally moved by the same experience that they get to share with you.\n\nWhat could be better than that?\n\nIf they farted.\n\nThat\'s why key number nine is gaffes!\n\nGaffes are INTEGRAL to E3, so much so that they\'re split into three different categories.\n\nThe first is technical.\n\nGameplay going awry.\n\nCameras cutting back too early.\n\nMics not getting shut off.\n\nThe second category is human.\n\nAwkward pauses, stiff actors, weird phrasing.\n\nThese stick in your brain forever.\n\nHonestly, it feels like they’re planned in order to be meme-able and rememberoareble.\n\nMem- and memorable.\n\nMemorable.\n\nGod, I can’t speak today…\n\nOR CAN I?\n\nTHE THIRD CATEGORY IS PLANNED GAFFES.\n\nI’m about to blow this whole thing wide open.\n\nEveryone can quote at least one E3 gaffe.\n\nEven people who don’t know who Reggie Fils Aime is have probably said “my body is ready”\n\nat least once in their life.\n\nAnd you want to know what that is?\n\nGUERRILLA MARKETING.\n\nThe only reason there are so many gaffes in E3 presentations is to MAKE YOU SHARE THE GAFFES.\n\nYOU MIGHT NOT REMEMBER THE GOOD PRESENTATIONS, BUT YOU SURE AS HELL LAUGHED AT THE MESSY ONES.\n\nTHE GAFFES ARE AN INSIDE JOB TO MAKE YOU BUY MORE VIDEO GAMES.\n\nSo honestly, I’m just gonna assume that all of these are planned from here on out\n\nin order to make you talk about them online.\n\nExcept for when Todd Howard says something that\'s weirdly horny.\n\nTodd: "You\'ll never know when you\'ll need a free hand."\n\nThat’s just Todd.\n\nBONUS POINTS for horny Todd.\n\nAnd the final key: The Big Finish.\n\nThis is a game announcement that falls purely into the fanservice bucket.\n\nIt is unimaginably amazing, incomprehensibly great, unbelievably too good to be true and\n\nhonestly, it\'s because it probably is too good to be true.\n\nThe presenter is gonna say “And one more thing,” and then they\'re gonna show a trailer\n\nthat’s probably a landscape shot, maybe some voiceover, and then just a title screen.\n\nBONUS POINTS if it literally is just a title screen.\n\nAnd then that game is probably gonna get stuck in development hell for 7 years and maybe\n\nnot get released ever.\n\nBut isn’t that what we want, as gamers?\n\nTo be disappointed?\n\nAnd those are the 10 keys to a perfect E3 presentation.\n\nFollow these and you can do no wrong.\n\nAnd if you aren’t doing an E3 presentation, again, you could potentially use them as a\n\ndrinking game.\n\nIt\'s not like I wrote up all the rules already and you can click and you can play \'em along\n\nwith us since we\'re gonna watch all the E3 presentations.\n\nAnd to prove the power of these keys, here’s my perfect E3 presentation.\n\nSony, go ahead and just plug your trailers into the placeholders I set up for you.\n\nWhat does a gamer want?\n\n(what does a gamer want, tell me what does a gamer want)\n\nWhat does a gamer need?\n\n(what does a gamer need, tell me what does a gamer need)\n\nThe games we make are powerful,\n\nnever been done before.\n\nSo let your inner gamer out, we’ll open up the door!\n\nI know you’ll love these games, because I love these games, too.\n\nAnd it feels the best when there’s an excited gamer inside you.\n\nHunter, Hunter, let me get off of the skate...\n\nJesus.\n\nHunter, get it!\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to Unraveled Games’ E3 press conference.\n\nAs a gamer myself, you can tell by the shirt, I’m so excited to share these fresh gaming\n\ninnovations with you all today.\n\nBut before we get to the fun part, let\'s talk some business.\n\nLet me put on my blazer.\n\nLet’s talk about how we’re changing the game… of games.\n\nThe new Unraveled Engine has allowed us to create experiences that are more detailed\n\nthan ever before.\n\nI\'m talking about 1,200 enemies onscreen concurrently, over 49 meganpixels of screen dissolution,\n\n62 giganbotes of RAM,\n\nand SEVEN HUNDRED and TWENTY THOUSAND…\n\nI know it sounds like science fiction, but it’s science fact.\n\nWhy don’t we highlight a few of the games that are coming out on the Unraveled Engine.\n\nWe can go to the next slide.\n\nJen?\n\nJen, we can go to the next.\n\nNext Gen!\n\nFirst up, Unraveled Research 2.\n\nFans loved the experience of creating spreadsheets about video game lore, but in this immersive\n\nsequel, you can do that with a mustache.\n\nWow.\n\nAnd that’s not all.\n\nWe have Explaining Your Job to your Relatives Simulator, the Dark Souls of simulation games.\n\nExperience the terror firsthand of trying to explain to your uncle that you work in\n\na very niche, unstable industry, but with graphics so lifelike you’ll feel like you’re\n\nliving in the world of the game.\n\nNo, Uncle Bob, I don’t make the video games, I just make videos about them.\n\nNo, they aren’t the trailers.\n\nTerrifying.\n\nAnd finally, something groundbreaking, something that seems impossible, but we did it.\n\nI hope you come along with us on this journey of...\n\nBDG Goes Fishing for the First Time\n\nin VR.\n\n*What?\n\nHell yeah!\n\nWhat!?*\n\n*Audience cheering*\n\nI\'ve got the rest of the press conference to get through, you\n\ncan quiet down, please.\n\nBut is that all we’ve got for you?\n\nNot in the slightest.\n\nNow it\'s time to show you some stuff from the company that didn\'t do the presentation,\n\nand let us do all the hard work for them.\n\nHit it.\n\n*Arcade Fire soundalike plays*\n\nWow.\n\nYou know, I, um, I\'m gonna go off script a little bit.\n\nI, uh, it just, I\'ve...\n\nIt means so much to me to be up here on this stage in front of you.\n\nIt\'s been a dream since I was a kid to be presenting something at E3, and to have you\n\nhere in the audience... to, to feel the support that you\'ve given Unraveled Games, is...\n\nHonestly, it\'s, um...\n\nI never in a million years thought that I could have-\n\nOH JESUS, HUNTER, DON\'T TRY TO...\n\nGod damnit.\n\nOkay that’s it, uh, thank you all for coming.\n\nExcept we\'ve got one more thing thing for you.\n\nWe’ve been working on something very special with some very special people.\n\nFrom the visionary minds of David Cage and Peter Molyneux, we have teamed up with publisher\n\nKonami to release an exclusive on Soulja Boy’s gaming console… you know what, I won’t\n\nbore you with the business details, I’ll just let you see the trailer.\n\nVoice over: Yeah.\n\nI think it’s time.\n\n*intense music plays*\n\n*applause*\n\nThank you all so much for coming!\n\nThank you.\n\nHave a great E3!\n\nHunter, get it!\n\n*CRASH* Ha, we\'re good.\n\nThat\'s the take though.\n\n*everyone laughing* Almost, almost broke a laptop.\n\nBut that\'s fine.\n\nWe\'re good.\n\nClayton (offscreen): Set a couple fires, it\'s okay!\n\nBrian: We, we, this is the most intense...\n\nPat: We\'re not allowed to do this show anymore. ', ' *hydraulic machine noises*\n\nFallout.\n\nThis scrappy, billion-dollar franchise takes a fun, kooky\n\nlook at planet-wide armageddon.\n\nIt\'s an alternate history, splitting off from our timeline somewhere\n\naround World War II.\n\nDespite the divergence, Fallout features some familiar real world\n\nculture and plenty of cultural innovation. There are new architectural styles that are\n\nstolen from Mad Max. And plenty of cool new fashion\n\nthat is also just ripped off from Mad Max.\n\nAnd yet, even with this cultural innovation, Fallout has one massive problem.\n\nAnd there\'s only one problem with the Fallout series right now.\n\nOther than that, the Fallout series is doing just fine.\n\nD-despite this one. It\'s just the one of them.\n\nWhy, Todd,\n\nis the music still this?\n\n*audio from three Fallout songs played simultaneously*\n\nThe same dozen songs from before the apocalypse.\n\nYou\'re telling me that humans figured out how to\n\nmake a gun that turns you into goo, and yet they haven\'t made any new music?\n\nThat’s garbage, Todd.\n\nFallout is a meditation on mutation and the ways that humanity and culture\n\nevolve to meet new challenges,\n\nand having music that stays the same the whole time is a plot hole.\n\nWar never changes. But music should.\n\nAnd today, I’m going to change it.\n\n*tech montage music playing*\n\nOoh! This is a new dance move for me.\n\nI don\'t know if I like it yet.\n\nNow, you may think that Fallout’s music is fine. It fits the aesthetic, and\n\nit adds a sense of retrofuturism.\n\nBut you’re wrong, and here’s why.\n\nThe Fallout games range in time from 2102, the year of Fallout 76, to 2287, the year of Fallout 4.\n\nThat’s a span of 185 years. Imagine for a second that our musical sensibilities hadn’t been\n\nupdated in nearly two hundred years, and the current song topping the Billboard charts\n\nwas The Alphabet Song, a song literally written about 185 years ago.\n\nActually, that kind of sounds possible. Modern times are weird.\n\nWhat I’m saying is that if 80% of humans died today, in 100 years,\n\nwe\'d still have Old Town Road, but it would have a few more remixes.\n\nDo you really think that if the world ended in 1997, our culture would linger over\n\n"Barbie Girl" and "Tubthumping"? That we would be complacent with the cultural detritus of euro-techno,\n\nmanufactured pop, and third-wave ska?\n\nNO!\n\nAnd yet it seems the people of Fallout have\n\nforgotten how to make music.\n\nFallout 76 is littered with instruments and bandstands and stages,\n\nbut by the time you get to Fallout 3, the only instrument left is a Stradivarius\n\nviolin locked in a vault surrounded by mirelurks.\n\nFallout 76 also has the highest track count,\n\nnearly twice as many as all of the other games, which implies that these tracks are being\n\nlost over time, and nothing is there to replace it.\n\nOnly two people in the entire 185-year-span\n\nof these games are making new songs. The first is a synth that makes the same bluesy style\n\nas the rest of the music.\n\nIt’s good but it’s not different.\n\nThe other is a burnout DJ who does not seem to know how to sing or play an instrument.\n\nAnd yet he still insists on playing a guitar,\n\nwhich goes to prove that even in the apocalypse, you can’t escape\n\nthe guy who will bring his guitar to your party.\n\nThank god the bombs went off before "Wonderwall."\n\nPeople need food to eat, sure, and, you know, clothes to cover their sinful\n\nbods so that makes sense that those areas have continued to flourish. But Fallout is\n\na world where people have ignored the basic human endeavor of making art.\n\nI won’t stand for that!\n\nWe need art because of its fundamental importance to human expression.\n\nSongs were made long before written language to help keep stories alive, and they\'d be added to\n\nand embellished, much like the cultural touchstone of our time,\n\nTVTropes.org.\n\nScience may improve our health and longevity, but art is what makes long life worth living.\n\nAnd that’s why I am here — to scientifically improve on this art,\n\nand synthesize a totally new genre of music that we should be hearing in the Fallout universe.\n\nThis genre should be inspired by the music landscape and culture of Fallout\'s world.\n\nAny cultural step that goes One Step Beyond current accepted standards\n\nrisks alienating its audience by being too challenging,\n\ntoo intelligent.\n\nSo let’s guide our creation by considering the 10 definitive purposes of music\n\nand how they fit into the beautiful wasteland of Todd’s mindscape.\n\nFirst, to create or control emotion.\n\nFrom the soaring, triumphant music of Jurassic Park\n\nto the ice cream truck version of "Pop Goes the Weasel,"\n\nwhich, for reasons I don’t understand, always makes me cry.\n\nEvoking emotion is the number one use for music.\n\nSo what does that mean for Fallout? Well, one thing the soundtrack does get right is the upbeat tempo\n\nof most of the songs. It cheers up the experience of playing through the wasteland.\n\nExcept for the miserable, inescapable energy of "Johnny Guitar."\n\nPlay it again, my Johnny.\n\nIn the wasteland, you need something to rev you up, keep you moving. And that\'s why this new genre\n\nwill only feature peppy songs.\n\nTwo: remembering or sharing information.\n\nThese can be simple mnemonics like Schoolhouse Rock! Or classic story ballads\n\nlike Kesha’s "TiK ToK."\n\nI actually believe these will be more important than emotions just because\n\nwritten language seems to be pretty dead in the future. It’s all on abandoned computers\n\nor in diaries safely tucked up in a skeleton\'s ribcage.\n\nUp-to-date information is transmitted verbally, and think about how much further it could go if it was sung.\n\nEven an S.O.S. signal gets more traction if it comes with a little ditty,\n\nand I learned that from Rihanna.\n\nThree: Entertainment.\n\n*cheesy music plays*\n\nFour: Jingles. In other words,\n\npropaganda.\n\nCommercial jingles are designed to make you remember brands, and political songs fit here, too.\n\nBecause what is the "Star Spangled Banner" if not America’s jingle?\n\nDespite the amount of remnant advertising for companies like Nuka-Cola and Radiation King,\n\nthe only jingles that remain in Fallout are the ones on Gene Autry’s spurs.\n\n*(I Got Spurs That) Jingle, Jangle, Jingle plays ominously*\n\nIn the song he says his spurs jingl-\n\nFallout does have a few antiquated political songs on Enclave Radio, but as Plato said:\n\n“Any musical innovation is full of danger to the whole State...\n\nwhen modes of music change, the State always changes with them.”\n\nThank you, Plato.\n\nThe transitive property means that the opposite must be true as well.\n\nFallout’s state has very much changed, and so too should the music.\n\nSo our music genre should be catchy to the point of propaganda.\n\nYou hear this song once, and you know the hook and exactly what it wants you to do.\n\nFive: To mark time rhythmically in a group, like a chain gang or rowing.\n\nAn underlying theme of Fallout is a disruption of low-wage labor systems.\n\nHalf the locations are robot warehouses or Nuka-Cola factories\n\nor the industrial goo pit where The Joker was made.\n\nIn the 2100s, commerce is no longer the main structure around\n\nwhich a human’s life is organized.\n\nSo fuck the Man, and fuck the beat he made you drum to.\n\nThe Man was beating you down, so we’re gonna focus on the up-beats.\n\nThe off-beats. Something more syncopated.\n\nThis isn\'t to say we\'re going to get overly complicated with 7/4s and 15/8 time signatures.\n\nThose time signatures only belong in math rock,\n\nwhich is to say in the garbage.\n\nWe’re taking back 4/4 from the Man and we\'re making it our own.\n\nSix: Tradition music, to mark events or occasions.\n\nThis can range from singing "Auld Lang Syne" on New Years\n\nto playing "Pop Goes the Weasel" whenever one of your pet weasels died when you were a kid.\n\nTHAT\'S WHY.\n\nThey’re just songs that usher in a specific moment, like an alarm.\n\nBut most cultures in Fallout don’t seem to use them.\n\nAt the end of the quest “A Nice Day for a Right Wedding,” there is a wedding but no wedding march.\n\nAnd in the quest “For Auld Lang Syne,” they do not play "Auld Lang Syne."\n\nWhich means there’s a real opening to be the only tradition song for every holiday in Fallout.\n\nIt may seem lame to force a tradition song, like making all of your friends call you by a nickname you gave yourself,\n\nbut if you believe that every tradition song came about naturally, you’re naive.\n\nYou think Vitamin C didn’t know that the graduation song would become a once-a-year cash cow?\n\nThat when Green Day was writing “Good Riddance” they weren’t\n\nthinking “Some sitcoms are gonna have to end someday.”\n\nTradition songs can be crafted,\n\nand our first song in this new genre will fit this bill.\n\nSeven: Ambient music or background music.\n\nA.K.A. Chill anime beats to study and relax to.\n\nNobody in Fallout is studying or relaxing. This one is a guide on what not to do in our new genre.\n\nOur genre should be present and aggressive, and when you’re listening to it, you are listening to it.\n\nEight: To create or maintain social groups.\n\nWithout labor to constrict a person’s time or movement,\n\npeople organize into social, cult-like gangs, which makes this category\n\na big one. You’ve got LARPers, the AV club, the rude boys, all of which have their own\n\ncultural standards. But there is a distinct lack of punks, which came about through a\n\nshared political consciousness expressed through music. But we can be that, we just need to\n\ninclude identity-establishing lyrics that appeal to all denizens of the Wasteland.\n\nPerhaps this genre will help unify all of the many warring factions.\n\nOr at least create a new, very cool warring faction.\n\nNumber nine: Stimulating physical movement. Dancing.\n\nThere is no dancing in Fallout! Well, there are a few sex workers in Fallout New Vegas that dance, but it kind\n\nof just looks like the dancing baby gif, so I don’t think that should count.\n\nAnd Fallout 76 hasn’t included a singular dancing emote. All they have are things like “smoking kills”\n\nand “join my polycule?”\n\nThis is probably to avoid overlapping with Fortnite, which\n\ndoes have a pretty long head start on dancing emotes. So for the sake of originality, I\n\nhad my research assistant, Google, find all of the dances that haven\'t been included in Fortnite yet.\n\nIt\'s just a Regency-era quadrille, and skanking.\n\nWe will make it work.\n\nAnd the tenth purpose of music is to use it as a crutch when you can’t think of a different way\n\nto end a video.\n\nActually, I don\'t think this one really applies to the Fallout universe,\n\nso I\'m just gonna take it off.\n\nSo with our nine definitive purposes of music, we can\n\nbegin to build our genre. And the more I’m thinking about these nine purposes, the more\n\nI\'m realizing that Fallout has the opportunity to create the perfect genre. One not tied\n\ndown to the whims of society.\n\nBut I\'m getting ahead of myself.\n\nThe current music in Fallout is overwhelmingly jazz standards and rhythm and blues,\n\nso we\'ll incorporate elements from those genres.\n\nWe’ll have heavy beats, syncopation, rhythm guitar, and honestly, any instrument\n\nthat fits in a mobile wasteland setting. So no pianos, but any marching instrument, like\n\ntrumpets and trombones. Things that stand up to roughing it and also would appeal to\n\nthe Brotherhood of Steel. Another thing these jazz standards excel at is having a powerful,\n\ncatchy melody sung by a main vocalist, but since it’s hard to maintain your safety\n\nas a loner in the wasteland, we can have a lot of backing vocalists, too.\n\nIf you can carry a gun, you can carry a tune.\n\nIn terms of topics for the songs, we\'ll keep the themes\n\nrelevant to the people of Fallout, which based on my experience seems to be freedom from\n\ntyranny, looting, and drinking so I can be stronger and carry more loot.\n\nNow, we mix together these in-fiction elements with our nine definitive purposes of music.\n\nOne: We’re gonna make people happy. Needs to be Jeep commercial music. Yeah, your wife just got\n\neaten by a yao guai, but listen to that skiffle.\n\nTwo: All of our heroes are dead. So it\'s time\n\nto make new heroes. How else are we gonna know how many beers Janice drank last week,\n\nor how far Kevin’s head went flying when a super mutant tagged him with a fire hydrant.\n\nThree:\n\nBangers only.\n\nFour: What should I do with the information about how many beers\n\nJanice drank? Tell me.\n\nThis is music for the scavenger, not the assembly line worker. There’s\n\na whole world of useful scrap out there, and this music should inspire you to get out there\n\nand pick it up!\n\nSix: The old ways are dead! And we\'ve gotta make new songs to celebrate\n\nthe new ways. There is no song for when your Swamp Itch clears up.\n\nBut there should be.\n\nSeven: Background music? NO. This is FOREGROUND MUSIC.\n\nEight: Fallout is a world divided,\n\nawaiting a messiah of music to bring them all together\n\nor at least inspire them to wear cooler clothes.\n\nNine: The music should inspire dances that are violent and rushed, just like\n\nthe world you\'re in. Yeah, your fists are used for melee, but that leaves your feet\n\nand your elbows open to fuckin\' jam!\n\nYou starting to imagine it? You starting to hear those first few notes in your head? THAT’S GOOD!\n\nWhat are we gonna call this new genre that\n\nis peppy! Informational! Good! Catchy! Pick up loot!\n\nTraditional! In your face! Punk!\n\nKicks! Energetic! Educational! Fun! Sticks in your head! Pick it up!\n\nFor your cousin Ben\'s wedding! Right there! Society.\n\n*dancing noises*\n\nSpicy! Slaps hard! Pick it up! Propaganda.\n\nArbor Day! Pick it up!\n\nFuck you, Philip Glass!\n\nPick it up! Let\'s all wear the same shoes!\n\n*repeating "DANCE!" and "PICK IT UP" over and over*\n\nPick it up!\n\n*heavy breathing*\n\nDid I just make Ska again?\n\n*Ska music starts*\n\nYou spend your life living in a vault, and your mind begins to crack.\n\nAnd when you get outside, there’s nothing to welcome you back.\n\nShe found me passed out in a rundown shack with Nuka Buzz in my hand.\n\nShe picked me up and she slapped my face, and said "Come on let’s start a band!"\n\nShe said: START THE MUSIC, Pick up loot, get off your ass!\n\nIf you don’t feel the Brotherhood of Steel, join the Brotherhood of Brass.\n\nShe said: START THE NEW, War never changes, that’s a bore!\n\nYou know we’ll eclipse the apocalypse\n\nwith a loud and brassy SKALLOUT WAR.\n\nSKALLOUT WAR!\n\nSKALLOUT WAR!\n\nSKALLOUT WAAAAAAAAR!\n\nSKALLOUT WAR!\n\nI\'ve never skanked so hard in my life. ', ' Fire Emblem!\n\nThis magnificent franchise pushes the boundaries of gaming by daring to ask the question,\n\n"What if chess made you horny?"\n\nFire Emblem is turning 30 next year, and with 16 main games and few spinoffs,\n\nit\'s safe to say that it has grown into something extraordinary.\n\nThe games are packed with deep storylines and memorable characters, like Marth.\n\nThat\'s not Marth? Marth.\n\nThat\'s- which one is Marth?\n\nMarth.\n\nThe problem with having such a prolific series is that the characters start to blend together.\n\nOne needs only to look at the Super Smash Bros. roster to see that\n\nFire Emblem characters are a bit hard to differentiate.\n\nIt\'s like trying to remember your coworkers\' names after meeting them once at a work mixer.\n\nExcept in this case, your coworkers all have swords and can only make one facial expression.\n\nBut do not worry. There is an answer to this conundrum. Because today,\n\nI\'m going to teach you how to tell apart every Fire Emblem character.\n\n*cheery synth music*\n\nMy face is just not built for this expression.\n\nFirst step in this process is to collect a list of the characters.\n\nTurns out, even after trimming the nonplayable ones and the ones from the Tokyo Mirage Sessions,\n\nthere are nearly 600 Fire Emblem characters.\n\nI cannot explain that many characters.\n\nI have made that mistake before.\n\n"Trying to categorize all 600 Castlevania monsters was a bad idea."\n\nBut the beauty of making mistakes is that you can learn from them. And I now know understand\n\nthat explaining 600 discrete characters wouldn\'t actually be helpful.\n\nHuman beings aren\'t meant to remember 600 people perfectly. If you don\'t believe me,\n\njust try to remember something about every single person in your contact list.\n\nI have a contact for someone name Zain.\n\nAnd in the company, it just says "Bocce Ball."\n\nWho the fuck is this?\n\nBut unlike my contact list, Fire Emblem\'s have plotlines.\n\nAnd in my experience playing these games, I noticed\n\nthat a lot of these different characters fit similar roles in their respective games.\n\nAnd I\'m not the only one who\'s noticed this. On the Fire Emblem wiki, there is a whole list\n\nof archetypes based on different characters.\n\nA list that I only found after spending whole day trying to categorize them on my own.\n\nAnd it\'s just so fun to realize that you\'ve wasted a whole day of work.\n\nBut this list intrigued me.\n\nStock characters in similar circumstances playing again and again in different stories.\n\nDoes that remind you of anything?\n\nOf course it does!\n\nIt reminds you of the commedia dell\'arte,\n\nbecause it reminds me of the commedia dell\'arte.\n\nAnd it\'s so obviously the commedia dell\'arte that I don\'t need to explain it.\n\nBut I will for the sake of extending this video.\n\nThe commedia dell\'arte was an Italian form of theater that was big in the 16th to 18th centuries,\n\nand it relied on stock characters wearing masks or costumes to designate who they were.\n\nThat way the audience could be like,\n\n"Ah, that dude\'s wearing a tight fitting suit with a bunch of weird patches, that must\n\nbe Arlecchino, the servant clown — sometimes to two masters!"\n\nThis brought the audience in immediately. They knew what that character was about without any exposition.\n\nIn the same way, Fire Emblem has dozens of recurring characters that get you through each game.\n\nAnd this is how we\'re going to tell them apart. By defining their archetypes.\n\nFire Emblem goes one step further.\n\nBecause these characters can not only serve the same story purpose,\n\nbut they can have a similar role in the gameplay.\n\nAnd this goes to prove my theory\n\nthat Fire Emblem is not only the spiritual successor to commedia dell\'arte,\n\nit is its natural evolution.\n\nAn elevated form I call...\n\nTHE COMMEDIA DELL\'ANIME.\n\nThe newer, more perfect form of theater.\n\nWe just have to boil down the Fire Emblem personnel into\n\n*kiss*\n\nsyrupy stock characters.\n\nLet\'s begin with the archetypes that are standard.\n\nCain and Abel are battle bros. They fight together, but not in the biblical sense.\n\nBord and Cords are similar except they\'re usually axe fighters.\n\nPegasus sisters are a trio of flying horses ladies.\n\nYou can\'t split these archetypes up into their solo characters because their bond is what defines them.\n\nYou can\'t have a Waluigi without a Luigi.\n\nAnd in the same way, you can\'t have a Bord without a Cord.\n\nWhich is my favorite Dr. Seuss book.\n\nJagens are mentors that are strong in the beginning and then you\'ll quickly outpace them, and it\'s kind of sad.\n\nLike the first time you beat your dad in a basketball game.\n\nOifeys are similar to Jagens,\n\nexcept they\'ll keep dunking on you till you\'re dead.\n\nWendells but for magic.\n\nGotohs are mentors but only the last half of the game.\n\nBeowolfs are mercenaries that you have to pay actual in-game currency\n\nto recruit, and Ogmas are mercenaries that usually decide to join you out of their own volition.\n\nWhich is, by definition, not a mercenary.\n\nNavarres are silent, moody sword swingers.\n\nKind of like if that person who said they studied the blade actually studied the blade.\n\nThere are also a bunch of villains but for different reasons. Power. Ambition. Loyalty.\n\nWyvern riding, I guess.\n\nAnd getting possessed, which is a classic mistake.\n\nSome archetypes are based on their gameplay requirements.\n\nVery difficult to recruit.\n\nUsually recruited after they\'ve been kidnapped.\n\nLate game recruits that could be good, but you have to work hard.\n\nSuper low level villagers that could also be good.\n\nAnd if you recruit one of these pairs,\n\nyou can\'t get the other.\n\nKind of like if two of your friends start dating and then have a really messy breakup.\n\nCorneliuses are usually the parental figure to the main character,\n\nand they have this nasty habit of getting axed super early on in the game.\n\nIt\'s kind of like Fire Emblem doesn\'t know how to make interesting characters without making them\n\nsuffer traumatic parental death.\n\nTacticians. Young female mages. Young female healers.\n\nYoung male mages.\n\nThieves.\n\nJeorges do that thing where they pretend to be not important\n\nand then SURPRISE, I wasn\'t an old crone, I was a magical witch the whole time!\n\nExcept they\'re not very good at hiding the fact that they\'re important.\n\nAnd the creepy version of the Jeorges:\n\nThe Tikis.\n\nUsually they take the form of a small girl or adolescent, except\n\nthey\'re really 400 years old and a god or a dragon.\n\nAnd I honestly do not have the time to unpack this bullshit.\n\nThese 29 archetypes are useful, but they only cover 229 characters.\n\nThere are still 367 to go. If we keep this up, we\'re going to end up with 75 archetypes.\n\nThe commedia dell\'arte only has about 17.\n\nSo before we move on, let\'s combine some.\n\nThese six are all mentors to varying degrees of usefulness.\n\nThese are all defined by their villainy and only some of them become playable.\n\nWelcome to Cain Siblings Incorporated, where we all have a sibling like bond and do the same job.\n\nThese all have very specific requirements for recruiting.\n\nThese both do that thing where they don\'t seem important and then Surprise!\n\nI\'m important!\n\nThese are all hard to make good but they\'re worth it if you put the effort in.\n\nThese are all precocious little magic babies.\n\nAnd that leaves the Navarres unconnected,\n\nbut that\'s because I\'m changing the archetype to Spicy Swords. Because we can include so\n\nmany other characters if we just expand the definitions to any swordweilder\n\nwho\'s a little spicy.\n\nIn fact, by combining these other archetypes, there are now tons of other characters who\n\nfit into these expanded definitions.\n\nWe are left with 288 characters to categorize. But before I get there,\n\nI just want to commend Fire Emblem for have 596 playable characters\n\nand only repeating three names.\n\nWhen I was hired for my first job at a climbing gym,\n\nI was one of five employees named Brian, and it was a small gym.\n\nBut I guess it\'s pretty easy to cut out repetitions when you use dope-ass names like Skrimir.\n\nDagdar.\n\nSleuf.\n\nFjorm.\n\nBelf.\n\nI could go on all day.\n\nBut I won\'t. Because it\'s time to get the rest of the archetypes on the wall.\n\n*charging noise*\n\nThat took like 30 minutes. But let\'s begin.\n\nThe honorable knight, like Fiona, who cares passionately about her people,\n\nand will always oppose cruelty to civilians.\n\nWhich is way better than the loyal knight, like Troude, who only is loyal\n\nto Perne, and will do literally anything for him even though Perne is a bad dude.\n\nBut I\'ll get to that later.\n\nThese four archetypes are calm and aloof, and the only thing that differentiates them\n\nis how much you would want to invite them to your birthday party.\n\nI\'m just gonna get the blank slate archetype out of the way now,\n\nbecause Fire Emblem is a game with permadeath,\n\nand so sometimes you just need more meat for the grinder, you know?\n\nSimilar to the blank slate is the protagonist,\n\nwhich is always relatively heroic, but since they\'re a conduit for the player, they\'re all pretty vague.\n\nI realize that by smooshing them all together into one category,\n\nI\'ve made the majority of the Fire Emblem roster in Super Smash indistinguishable.\n\nBut that\'s not my fault!\n\nSuper Smash should\'ve included more magic babies!\n\nArrogants, hotheads, and edgelords all have a mean side,\n\nbut arrogants like Vaike just think they\'re the best.\n\nHotheads like Caspar want to fight anything that moves.\n\nAnd edgelords like Niles retweet Joker accounts unironically.\n\nA lot of these characters have rough childhoods but then turn out cheerful despite that.\n\nAnd then there\'s the inferiority complex archetype, which I could have just called\n\n"The majority of children in Fire Emblem: Fates."\n\nPerfectionists, mischief makers, and flirts are all highly motivated.\n\nBut Subaki is motivated to meet high expectations.\n\nClaude is motivated to make intricate schemes.\n\nAnd Sylvain is motivated to be a fuccboi.\n\nBuzzkills are just characters that aren\'t very fun to talk to.\n\nAnd Fire Emblem, I will never forgive you for naming an unemotional, uber religious, deadbeat dad Gilbert.\n\nIt also doesn\'t help that I look like Hanneman Lite.\n\nOh god, am I a buzzkill?\n\nA lot of these archetypes are based around one singular personality trait.\n\nScarlet\'s straightforward. Valbar\'s chill.\n\nLinhardt\'s lazy. Sumia\'s clumsy. Petra\'s a sweetie.\n\nAnd Ranulf is a furry.\n\nDramatic, painter, and fashionable are defined by their love of the arts\n\nand how much it sucks that they gotta be a soldier instead.\n\nSome archetypes upset the status quo by defying gender norms\n\nor by calling out the noble class, and that\'s why they\'re comrades.\n\nChild soldier.\n\nKarin is canonically 14 years old.\n\nWhoopsie!\n\nBut even if they aren\'t a child, they could still be naive.\n\nWhich brings around the overprotective archetype,\n\nwhich is just essentially helicopter parents.\n\nManuela is constantly drinking and flirting and just being a hot mess and I love her for it.\n\nAnd that makes her the president of vices.\n\nThe vice president.\n\nBut be careful not to do that around someone like Astram, who is constantly accusing people of treason\n\nfor no good reason.\n\nThere\'s a lot of characters in the meek murderer archetype\n\nbecause Fire Emblem loves to make characters that are quiet and shy and really self conscious,\n\nand then can WRECK SHOP on the battlefield.\n\nHere\'s an archetype I call "what the fuck" and it\'s the three characters that make me say,\n\n"What the fuck, Fire Emblem?"\n\nPeople like Perne, who is said to be a sweet Robin Hood type,\n\nexcept he does kidnap a young girl and keeps her as his slave.\n\nOr Tharja, who practices curses on her own daughter.\n\nOr Roger, who is act- he\'s not actually that bad.\n\nBut Fire Emblem does go out of their way to make his endscreen say that he never gets a date\n\nand he stays single for the rest of his life.\n\nAnd it\'s like, what the fuck, Fire Emblem? You didn\'t have to do him dirty like that.\n\nThe next archetype is called "actually pretty interesting." These characters are three dimensional\n\nand well-developed. People like Libra, who struggles with his faith and has incredible\n\nself doubt even though he\'s doing all he can to help those around him. Or Rhys, who dreams\n\nof being a swordfighter, but his weak constitution won\'t allow him to become one. And so he helps\n\nin the ways he can, but his whole story is one of unfulfilled dreams.\n\nAnd that\'s it.\n\nThose are the only two interesting characters in Fire Emblem.\n\nUntil we get to Raphael.\n\nMy sweet, bulky boy who only cares about eating and training and not about studying.\n\nThe thing is, the Fire Emblem world has moved past himbos and bimbos.\n\nWelcome to the age of thembos.\n\nThere. 45 archetypes to help you differentiate the 596 Fire Emblem characters.\n\nIf you\'re a GOSH DANG ROCKET SCIENTIST!\n\n45 is still too much! We can combine these.\n\nWe\'ll take these six and combine them to create a new archetype that is as important as it is bland.\n\nThese three can be more succinctly summarized in a category called\n\n"Holy shit, why are you a soldier?"\n\nLet\'s just go ahead and cordon off all of the assholes.\n\nAnd now we can take these straight-talking suck ups and call them teacher\'s pets.\n\nShhhh.\n\nThese three archetypes all have tough exteriors to break through.\n\nThese three archetypes really explore familial bonds,\n\nwhich is a RARE CONDITION, IN THIS DAY-\n\nWhether it\'s a good or bad reaction doesn\'t matter to this group, they just want to be seen.\n\nThey\'re just too nice for all this!\n\nThese four archetypes will always be subverting expectations.\n\nIt\'s fairly surprising that these three archetypes were let in.\n\nChill dudes? Gambling? A bunch of hunks?\n\nDamn if these aren\'t fun to hang out with.\n\nAll three of these are going to time out, \'cause they need to calm it down.\n\nAnd there we go.\n\nThe 13 archetypes that make it possible to differentiate the Fire Emblem characters.\n\nJust 13 of them.\n\nThat\'s fewer than the commedia dell\'arte.\n\nIt\'s only 13.\n\nWhich is not only an unlucky number,\n\nbut it is TOO LARGE for your TINY CHILD BRAINS.\n\nWe can make it better! We can combine more! WE CAN PERFECT THIS!\n\nGranted, it\'s a little bit harder to combine these archetypes, but just off the bat, we can take\n\n"look at me baby" and "making waves" and just combine it into one thing, trendsetters.\n\nAnd the "necessary but boring" and the "asshole crew" and the "teacher\'s pets" and the "calm it downs,"\n\nthey all fill me with a sense of UGH.\n\nAnd obviously the "too nice for this" and the "lied on your resume" and the "holy shit why are you a soldiers"\n\nare all just a bad choice for a war!\n\nAnd that just leaves us with the characters that are hard to break\n\nthe ice with, and uh, the ones that got family issues, and the quiet ones, and the ones that\n\nare fun to hang out with!\n\nUh.\n\nAnd that just sounds like a pretty run-of-the-mill\n\nawkward family reunion.\n\nAnd when you think about it, these ones are just strange characters that\n\nhave, uh, that are good at fighting.\n\nI mean if you include Dmitri in this, he has an eye patch!\n\nOkay, which is similar to these ones.\n\nSeteth and Byleth have the, they rhyme.\n\nUh we also, I mean.\n\nDorothea wears a hat until she grows out of the hat.\n\nThink about that!\n\nDon\'t even get me started on Oboro.\n\nI don\'t know who that is.\n\nIs it pronounced "dice" or "deesay?"\n\nAnd we can have a category called\n\n"anime character with a singular personality trait and a penchant for violence"\n\nand that\'s just the one category!\n\nWhich PROVES that the Fire Emblem characters are all essentially the same,\n\nand that you cannot differentiate them.\n\nMission complete!\n\nWhat was this Unraveled about again?\n\n...Sometimes to two masters!\n\nPatrick: Now Italian.\n\n(Brian in a shitty Italian accent) Ah! That guy is...\n\noh god I don\'t know if I can.\n\nAh that dudes wearing a tight fitting suit with a buncha weird patches it\n\nmust be Arlecchino the servant clown sometimesa to two masters!\n\n(Pat and Jenna offscreen laughing)\n\nBrian: Ah I don\'t know if... Okay.\n\nPat: We don\'t have to use it but we need to record it. ', ' Should auld acquaintance be forgot.\n\nAnd\n\nall\n\nthat\n\nJAZZ.\n\nTHAT’S RIGHT FRIENDS it’s Game of the Year season!\n\nWhich means it\'s time for us to hop on those message boards, chat about our favorite games,\n\nand tear out each other’s throats when someone expresses an opinion\n\nthat is slightly different from our own.\n\nBy this point, pretty much every gaming publication has announced their Game of the Year...\n\nuhh...\n\nwhich means that I\'m a bit late.\n\nAnything that I say is just a drop in the ocean of discourse.\n\nNo one wants to hear my opinion.\n\nWHICH IS WHY I AM NOT EXPRESSING AN OPINION.\n\nI AM STATING A FACT.\n\nThat’s right, I have devised a statistical, analytical, number-crunching formula\n\nthat will SCIENTIFICALLY PROVE\n\nTHE GAME OF THE YEAR.\n\n*hype 80s music plays*\n\nThey said it couldn’t be done.\n\nA bias-free formula to calculate the game of the year?\n\nThat\'s a fool’s errand, Brian!\n\nYou are a fool!\n\nThey called me a fool!\n\nBut do I look like a fool to you?\n\nI’ve done it, and with the knowledge I have found, I can go ahead and assuage any arguments\n\nyou might have with your friends.\n\nThere is nothing to debate anymore, there is only the truth, that the best game of the year is...\n\nhidden somewhere, um, in these spreadsheets.\n\nI\'m gonna be honest with you, I haven’t...\n\nthere are a lot of numbers.\n\nAnd I haven\'t had the time to, uh, do them all just yet.\n\nBut it’s only December 14th.\n\nThis video is set to go up on the 30th, which means I still have two weeks for new games\n\nto come in before I can really call which game is the game of the year.\n\nBut I\'ve at least finished the formula, and I’ve tested it on a few to make sure it\n\nruns correctly.\n\nAnd everyone knows that you can’t get full credit unless you show your work.\n\nSo let me show you how I made it.\n\nFirst thing you gotta do when you\'re making a GOTY formula is find your list of games.\n\nAnd obviously we\'re going to have to choose every single game that was released this year\n\nin order for us to say that it is scientifically accurate.\n\nSo if we just go ahead and take a look at Steam and see how many were released since\n\nJanuary 1st 20-hmm.\n\nThat\'s over 15,000.\n\nYou can\'t make me do that, legally.\n\nThat\'s not in my contract.\n\nRight?\n\nI can\'t... they can\'t legally make me do that.\n\nLook, as much as video game reviews can be an imperfect reflection of the person who\n\nis writing them, they are still a pretty solid baseline for which video games mattered in our culture.\n\nEven if a review is bad, it still means it was good enough for someone to spend time on it.\n\nSo I went Metacritic and I took all the games that were rated 80 or above, and at\n\nthe time of writing this script, that was 181 games.\n\nSo I\'m gonna do the formula for all of those.\n\nSome of these games were DLCs or re-releases onto new platforms.\n\nThe Switch alone resurrected about a dozen candidates from years past.\n\nBut since they were released this year, they are still technically in the running.\n\nFight me.\n\nNow that we have the list, it\'s time to make the formula, and it might surprise you to\n\nhear this, but I have not been in a pure mathematics class in about five years.\n\nSo I reached out to some scientists.\n\nAnd then none of them got back to me.\n\nSo I called my old roommate.\n\n“Hey, I’m Nicholas.\n\nI’m a graduate student studying exoplanet atmospheres.”\n\nNick is working toward a PhD at MIT, and though I was a bit worried about reaching out to\n\nhim since his specialization is in astrophysics and not stats about video games,\n\nhe assuaged all my fears.\n\nBrian - "Would you say you are a math expert?”\n\nNick - “No.”\n\nWe chatted for about a half an hour, diving deep into the scientific method and the selfless\n\ngoals of discovery.\n\nBrian - “If I invent a unit... can I trademark it.”\n\nNick - “I think your final score should be, like, in Gilberts or whatever.”\n\nBrian - "OK!"\n\nAnd we finished our chat with the reassurance that this formula was not only going to help\n\nthe gaming community, but the scientific community at large.\n\nBrian - “Do you think if I wrote this up, I could get it published in, like, Nature?"\n\nNick - “No.”\n\nSo where to do we go from here now that we have been scientifically rejuvenated?\n\nIt\'s time to build the criteria.\n\nWhat specifically makes a game of the year?\n\nNumber one, what is the game worth?\n\nWe\'re not just talking about monetary worth, we\'re also talking about the amount of enjoyment\n\nyou get while playing the game.\n\nNumber two, how them graphics?\n\nWe’re trying to find specific numbers associated with these games, and graphics is just a bunch\n\nof numbers anyway, so this will be a useful part.\n\nNumber three, how did it affect the cultural miasma?\n\nLook, it’s all about those google results, how many people are talking about the game?\n\nAnd most importantly, is the game art?\n\nI\'ve figured it out.\n\nWhich means that no one has to write any more goddamn thinkpieces about this topic ever again!\n\nGiven these four criteria, I sat down with Tara Long, former bioinformatics researcher\n\nand also my current boss.\n\nShe and I figured out a formula that will end up with a numerical value that will tell\n\nus the game of the year.\n\nThe higher the number, the better the game.\n\nWe’ll start with game worth.\n\nNow it’s hard for us to find how worth it a game is to play from a numerical standpoint,\n\nbut if you take Metacritic’s score as a percentage of the game you enjoy, and you\n\nmultiply that by the average amount of minutes each playthrough takes using the stats from\n\nhowlongtobeat.com, then you end up with a number of minutes you have spent enjoying said game.\n\nNow, to tie in material worth, we want to go ahead and take in the original listed price\n\nof the game and divide it by this number so that way we can end up with a DPM: dollars\n\nper minute enjoyed.\n\nNow, it’s hard to decide if you want a high or a low DPM, because some people want the\n\nmost bang for their buck, while others are willing to spend a little bit more for a really\n\nwell-enjoyed minute.\n\nBut just to standardize this, I\'m going to assume lower is better — that means you\'ve\n\npaid less per minute you\'ve enjoyed — and that way I can use it to divide literally\n\nthe rest of the equation.\n\nHOW BOUT THEM GRAPHICS?\n\nIn the past few years, people have cared less and less about how many\n\npolygons you\'ve got on the screen and more about the style.\n\nBut one thing that hasn\'t changed is frame rate.\n\nPeople want the most frames per second.\n\nSo, factually, the more frames, the better.\n\nThat means we\'re going to go ahead and take the highest frame rate available in the game\n\nand we\'re gonna multiply that by the seconds of average playthrough, again from howlongtobeat.com.\n\nAnd that will give us the amount of frames per game.\n\nThe game frames mainframe.\n\nBut how many frames does a gamer game in the gameframe mainframe?\n\nThat\'s a good question.\n\nNow if you go ahead and you take your frames per game and divide it by the number of gamers,\n\nI’m talking about however many copies have been sold or however many number of downloads\n\nthere have been, then that\'s going to leave you with frames per game per gamer, and that’s\n\na really important number, because if you have 200,000 frames per game and you have\n\n200,000 gamers, that\'s 200,000 gamers that have only had one frame per game per gamer.\n\nAnd that is no good, is it?\n\nIs it?\n\nI actually have... um, I\'m a little confused now.\n\nWe\'re gonna take frames per game per gamer and we\'re gonna put it on the top of this\n\nequation, because we want it to be the biggest number possible.\n\nAnd now it’s time for cultural relevancy.\n\nWe want our games of the year to be big and brash and bold and boisterous, letting people\n\noutside of the gaming world know,\n\nHey!\n\nThis is a thing!\n\nSo how do we judge a game’s effect on the world at large?\n\nWell, we go ahead and we take all of the Google results that come up when you search\n\nthe game\'s full name and the word game.\n\nBut that’s not everything, right?\n\nThat\'s just the bare minimum.\n\nIt\'s like saying, “This dude’s bad haircut is important just because a lot of people are talking about it,”\n\nwhich I know isn’t true from personal experience.\n\nSo I went on twitter and I asked you lovely folks what descriptors you expect to see in\n\ndescriptions of games of the year.\n\nAnd you gave me a lot.\n\nSo I went ahead and I plugged all those into Google’s advanced search along with the\n\ngame\'s name, and I took those results and I multiplied it by the base Google search.\n\nAnd I got very big numbers.\n\nBut don\'t worry, we\'re going to bring these numbers down to size, because some of the\n\ndescriptions you sent in were actually pretty negative descriptions of games.\n\nSo I did a Google search using those descriptions, and then I multiplied those results by one\n\nplus the number of Funko Pops made of characters in the game,\n\nwhich is objectively a terrible thing.\n\nNow this is going to leave you with BCE, or your base cultural effect, and we\'re gonna\n\nmultiply that by our FPGPG in order to get a pretty big number.\n\nBut before we’re done with cultural effect, I want you to ask yourself, is this the culture at large?\n\nDoes this go outside of our gaming bubble?\n\nThere’s really only one way to tell that, and that\'s by using the M.O.M. variable,\n\nwhich stands for: "My Own Mother."\n\nSo I called my own mother for help.\n\n"Hello, Brian, I\'m a follower and a subscriber as well as your mother."\n\nBrian - "That\'s very good to hear.\n\nI... you support me so well and I appreciate that.\n\nI should ask you, Mom, would you consider yourself a gamer?"\n\nMom - "When I play Mario Kart with, like, grandchildren and things like that, I always\n\ngo off the road."\n\nBrian - "That\'s, but, on purpose to let them feel better."\n\nMom - "Very similar to my real-life driving skills, I find."\n\nBrian - "I have a list of 181 video games, now I know that\'s a lot.\n\nI\'m basically gonna run through this, and I\'m gonna ask you if you have heard of this game.\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2."\n\nMom - "No."\n\nBrian - "God of War."\n\nMom - "Yes!\n\nI have heard of that."\n\nBrian - "Oh, OK!"\n\nWhile subjecting my mom to a litany of 2018\'s best games,\n\nit became clear that she was very interested in the topic.\n\nBrian - "We\'re only 57 in, so we\'ve still got another 130 to go."\n\nMom - "I can\'t tell you how, what an exciting time this is for me."\n\nBrian - "Now you get taste of what it\'s like to do my job."\n\nMom - "I tell you what, this is a lot of research into things that really have very little meaning."\n\nBrian - "You\'re right.\n\nIt is."\n\nSo once I had asked my mom about all of the games from the game of the year list, I was\n\nable to throw it into a boolean function.\n\nIf mom knows game equals true, then that’s a plus one here.\n\nAnd then I could raise our base cultural effect to the power of mom, so if she doesn\'t know\n\nit, that\'s just to the power of one.\n\nIf she does, that\'s to the power of two.\n\nFinally, it’s time for our fourth, and perhaps most important criteria: Is this game art?\n\nAnd when you start asking if something is art, then you really end up asking,\n\n"Why should we even be defining what is and isn\'t art?"\n\nAnd the only thing worse than discourse about "are games art?" is\n\nthe discourse ABOUT the discourse of "are games art?"\n\nLook, art is experiential and that\'s a beautiful thing that should be allowed to flourish without\n\nhaving some pseudoscientific proof of greatness thrust upon it.\n\nWhich is why I\'m not proving greatness.\n\nInstead, this part of the formula is so revolutionary because I am proving art.\n\nSo let\'s go ahead and throw this into...\n\nShit, I ran out of space.\n\nYou know what, this part wasn\'t that important.\n\nWe\'re just gonna cut it.\n\nThis big GOTY equation ends up with very large numbers, which would be too hard to show all of.\n\nSo I needed to make a new unit.\n\nSomething I could reduce them all down to.\n\nI plugged in my favorite game of the year, Celeste, and I used that to be our new baseline.\n\nCeleste equals one BDG.\n\nOr Big Determinant of Game.\n\nEverything else will be reduced down using Celeste’s score to a scale of BDGs.\n\nSo that\'s it.\n\nThat’s the entire formula.\n\nAnd if you\'ll excuse me, I have to go do my dark bidding on these spreadsheets and I will\n\ncome back to you right now.\n\nDecember 30th.\n\nNew year is at our doorstep.\n\nKnock knock!\n\nWho’s there?\n\nIt’s 2019!\n\nCome on in, hope you\'re not as big of an asshole as the past few of your friends!\n\nI spent the past two weeks crunching the numbers, and it is my honor to announce that\n\n2018’s scientifically calculated game of the year, with 19...\n\ntrillion BDGs...\n\nis Fortnite.\n\nThat can\'t be the right number, I\'m gonna...\n\nNo, that\'s right.\n\nYou remember when Pluto stopped being a planet, and the scientists were like,\n\n"Hey, that\'s just what the definitions say!"\n\nAnd we were like,\n\n"Hey, scientists, maybe your definitions are busted!"\n\nMaybe my formula is busted.\n\nThe fact that God of War got 2.1 million BDGs and Red Dead Redemption 2 got 0.1 BDG...\n\nMaybe I shouldn\'t have made my mom\'s knowledge of the game an exponential factor.\n\nBrian - "You know Tetris.\n\nYou would really like this Tetris..."\n\nMom - *sings the entire Tetris song*\n\nNo, I stand by that decision.\n\nLet’s be honest, the stats I was using definitely favored cultural importance, and Fortnite’s\n\ncultural effect was orders of magnitude larger than any other game this year.\n\nAnd though I\'ve never played Fortnite\n\n— which proves my lack of bias and also that I’m professionally irresponsible —\n\nthere can be no denying that it has made a lasting impact\n\noutside of the video game world.\n\nIt’s the only nonseries game that my mom knew about.\n\nAnd regardless of how you feel about the Fortnite, it drew together a collection of people that\n\nmight not have otherwise connected, and that’s a valuable thing.\n\nAnd even when your Uncle Devin comes up to you at the holiday get together and says,\n\n“HEY BRIAN, WHAT IN THE HECK IS THIS FORTNITE THING?”\n\nit gives you a common ground to chat,\n\nand you really haven\'t chatted with Uncle Devin in a while.\n\nYou should call him more often.\n\nHe wants to show you his Civil War books.\n\nAnd his collection of swords.\n\nBut if you’re upset, and you didn’t IMMEDIATELY close this YouTube tab to send me an angry tweet,\n\nI’ve got an extra little gift for you.\n\nIt\'s a new formula.\n\nGOTY equals x times 1 quadrillion.\n\nAnd x equals your favorite game.\n\nOf this year.\n\nNow you can go ahead and tell your friends that Brian scientifically proved that my favorite game\n\nis the game of the year, and then you can share them this link,\n\nand then they won’t click on it because it’s a 15 minute video, so your secret is safe with me.\n\nAnd to be honest, your favorite game deserves it,\n\nbecause if you liked it enough to call it your game of the year,\n\nthen it must be pretty meaningful to you,\n\nand no one can take that away.\n\nSo congratulations, Fortnite, and congratulations, your favorite game.\n\nHere’s hoping 2019 is full of wonderful games and even more wonderful experiences.\n\n*wink*\n\nHappy New Year.\n\nOH.\n\nOH MY GOD THAT IS SO HOT.\n\nOHHH MY GOD.\n\nIT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PROP WATER, PAT.\n\nOH I PROBABLY JUST LIKE RUINED THIS MIC, TOO.\n\nJESUS, PAT.\n\nI TOLD YOU IT WAS PROP WATER.\n\nGOD.\n\nI\'m okay.\n\nMom - "Does enthusiasm count or anything like that?\n\nShould it just be, or just be, just bare bones..."\n\nBrian - "Mom, to be honest, I don\'t think you can do this not enthusiastically, so,\n\nyou\'re gonna be fine." ', ' PC gaming is a vast ocean of entertainment,\n\nand if you want to explore, all you have to do is sail out.\n\nAnd speaking of selling out,\n\nthis is my first-ever sponsored video!\n\nThat\'s right, the-\n\nthe folks over at Riot have decided to corporately sanction\n\na video from a man who is best known\n\nfor hanging sad clown portraits in his apartment.\n\nYou see, they just released VALORANT,\n\nand since I\'m currently stuck at home\n\nthey were kind enough to give me a budget\n\nto help turbocharge my computer,\n\nso that way I could unravel how to get good at PC gaming.\n\nBut the thing about VALORANT\n\nis that you don\'t need a high-end PC to play it.\n\nRiot told me that even on an old clunker\n\nwith minimum specs, you can still play competitively.\n\nAnd sure enough, I excavated my ancient PC\n\nin order to test this, and it played great.\n\n- It plays great.\n\nOh, that doesn\'t count.\n\nSo I could use that sponsorship money\n\nto soup up my computer or I could use it\n\nto solve one of PC gaming\'s biggest problems.\n\nUnlike a console, which can plug into a communal TV,\n\ntrue PC gaming needs a dedicated space.\n\nI live in a three-bedroom apartment with two other roommates\n\nand they are not gonna be cool with me\n\nsetting up my sick rig in the spot where we keep\n\nrecycling that we haven\'t taken out in two weeks.\n\nIn fact, the only unused personal space I have\n\nis this four-foot square right next to my radiator.\n\nAnd I like to keep that block unused\n\nfor whenever I wanna feel like a rich person.\n\n- Check me out!\n\nBut maybe, with a little help from my sponsor...\'s money,\n\nI can turn those 16 square feet into a gamer\'s paradise.\n\nToday I\'m teaching you how to make the perfect gamer space.\n\n(lively dance music)\n\nOh!\n\nYeah!\n\nFor inspiration, I asked a couple coworkers\n\nwhat they look for in a PC gaming space.\n\n- Hi, I\'m Jeff Ramos.\n\n- I\'m Julia.\n\nIf there was anyone at Polygon who could lead me\n\nto gamer space perfection it would be Jeff and Julia,\n\nand in our discussions it became clear\n\nthat there are four major elements\n\nto a good gaming environment.\n\nThe first is a solid foundation.\n\nIf I want to build a PC gaming space,\n\nwhere should I start?\n\n- First, I think you need a computer.\n\n- Check!\n\nBut without these other foundational elements,\n\nI\'ll have less of a gamer space\n\nand more of an ominous obelisk.\n\nFrom there, you can start embellishing your foundation\n\nwith element two, a virtual gaming space,\n\nwhich is just a fancy way of saying\n\na place you can stream games from.\n\n- It made me feel a little less lonely\n\nas I\'m studying and stuff,\n\nbecause there\'s just like a voice.\n\nAnd I guess I wanted to do that for people, also.\n\n- Streaming for you was less about\n\ngetting big and it was more about\n\nsharing an experience with your friends.\n\n- If I got big along the way I would be like, "That\'s fine."\n\n- Element three is aesthetics.\n\nIf you\'re gonna spend hours at your computer,\n\nat the very least it should be nice to look at,\n\nand it should represent you.\n\n- Everything else at my desk is black.\n\nThere\'s very little decoration, and I like that\n\n\'cause it\'s clear mind, I can just focus\n\non what I\'m doing at any given moment,\n\nversus looking at a desk full of Funko Pops.\n\n- I had, I think, this specific Pop figure\n\nof Vi from "League of Legends."\n\nand then it just kind of expanded.\n\nSince I work from home, too,\n\nI try to make my space fun and engaging.\n\n- And the final element: Caters to bodily needs.\n\n- What type of chair is that that you\'re sitting in?\n\n- Oh, it\'s a terrible one and it\'s going to be replaced.\n\nAnd it gives me consistent back pain.\n\n- Does that affect your gaming at all?\n\n- If I\'m not comfortable, then I\'m just thinking,\n\n"Dang, my butt hurts, my back hurts,"\n\nand then I can\'t pay attention to things.\n\n- Do you ever eat near your computer?\n\nDo you ever have to refuel?\n\n- I try to separate eating from my desk space.\n\nThere is a space off to the left where I usually\n\nwill always have a coffee cup and a water bottle,\n\nand sometimes there\'ll be like a snack.\n\n- When you\'re in the throes of a match,\n\nyou don\'t wanna be worried about your back hurting\n\nor feeling a little famished,\n\nand that means your gamer space should provide\n\nthe fuel and comfort your body needs.\n\nIf you can amalgamate these four elements,\n\nyou\'ll have a good gamer space.\n\nBut I\'m making the perfect one.\n\nAnd how can we prove it\'s perfect?\n\nAn increase in gaming performance!\n\nHa ha, you thought I wasn\'t gonna do\n\nwhat I was sponsored to do!\n\nGet outta here, I\'m just killin\' two birds with one stone!\n\nMy coworkers said in no uncertain terms\n\nthat a good gamer space will make me a better gamer.\n\nOnce I have a dedicated space,\n\nthat\'s gonna be all I\'m gonna need\n\nin order to be proficient at this game?\n\n- Well, you should still practice a little bit, I mean--\n\n- Though I normally don\'t let little things like rules\n\nstand between me and victory,\n\n"Valorant" has anti-cheat software\n\nthat kinda makes that impossible,\n\nso there really is no way for me\n\nto get good at this game without practicing.\n\nBut a perfect gamer space will envelop me\n\nin a cocoon of learning,\n\nshutting out the world around me.\n\nBy the end of this build, I\'ll prove\n\nthat I\'ve developed a perfect gamer space\n\nby showing just how much better at PC gaming I\'ve become.\n\nLuckily, that\'s not a very high bar.\n\nThat doesn\'t count.\n\nAnd with my four elements defined, it was time to start.\n\nI taped out the four-by-four square\n\nand purchased a desk that would fit within the perimeter,\n\nbuilt the desk, got the monitor unpacked,\n\ncomputer, keyboard, mouse in position,\n\nand we were in business.\n\nElement one, check.\n\nI hopped right into "Valorant," and things were going\n\nway better than with my coffee table setup.\n\nAnd in hindsight,\n\nmaybe I should\'ve stopped there.\n\nBut I still had money to burn.\n\nYou see, I really was getting better at "Valorant,"\n\nbut I had no way of clearly showing\n\njust how well I was doing.\n\nAnd as Jeff said--\n\n- \'Cause if I no-scope and there\'s no one around to see it,\n\nthen does it matter?\n\n- I ordered a nice microphone and got out my old webcam\n\nto set up my streaming space.\n\nAll right, check, check.\n\nWe are set to go, everything looks great on the... game.\n\nThings do not look as great...\n\nAlthough I was prepared to start gaming for the masses,\n\nmy room was not.\n\nI can do better than this.\n\nIf I go live with this setup,\n\neveryone\'s gonna make fun of my finger-jointed\n\nbuilder\'s-grade garbage molding!\n\nI can\'t be known as the substandard molding guy.\n\nLuckily, I had two sources of inspiration\n\nfor gamer space aesthetics on opposite\n\nsides of the spectrum.\n\nI wanted to land somewhere in the middle.\n\nObviously, the first step\n\nwas installing RGB LEDs, because a gamer space\n\nwithout constantly changing rainbow lights\n\nis like a little league coach without wraparound Oakleys.\n\nI also purchased a modest number of game figurines,\n\nbecause even with a sponsor,\n\nhoo boy, those things are expensive.\n\nBut at the end of this, my space still felt pretty empty,\n\nso I gathered all the figurines I could find.\n\nAll of them.\n\nBeyond this, there was nothing behind me\n\nto brand me as a true gamer for the stream viewers,\n\nso I mocked up a quick poster idea\n\nand sent it over to my coworker Pat\n\nfor some illustration work,\n\nand used a little bit more of that sponsor money\n\nto purchase a large cloth banner.\n\nOh my god.\n\nIt\'s perfect.\n\nFinally, I purchased a video game-themed birthday party set,\n\nand with that my aesthetic was complete.\n\nWhat\'s up, y\'all!\n\nI am back at it at the streaming setup.\n\nWe\'ve got everyone here.\n\nYou can tell, as I always say back there,\n\ndon\'t talk to me before I\'ve had my gaming.\n\nI just have a little, there\'s actually nothing in this cup.\n\nI should probably get something into this cup.\n\nJeff warned me about keeping snacks off my desk,\n\nbut I was worried about getting hangry\n\nin the middle of gaming.\n\nSo I prepped some peanut butter toast.\n\nAlso, Julia had a specific piece of advice\n\nabout emotional needs.\n\n- I have one of the guy from Beastars,\n\nso when I get too mad about playing video games\n\nI can look at him and he\'ll soothe me.\n\n- Though the sight of an anthropomorphic wolf\n\nisn\'t necessarily soothing to me,\n\nI do think it\'s important for me to have something\n\nto calm me down after the rough matches:\n\nWarm milk.\n\nAnd I still had some sponsorship money left over,\n\nso I purchased myself a gamer chair.\n\nUnfortunately, the only one that could ship in time\n\nwas the largest size, which meant\n\nI had to rearrange some furniture.\n\nAnd with that, the perfect gamer space was complete,\n\nall four elements checked.\n\nThe gamer space is created,\n\nand all that\'s left for me to do\n\nis be the gamer within the space.\n\nI played a few matches, taking a sip from the warm milk\n\nany time I got a little flustered.\n\nBut for some reason, I wasn\'t much better\n\nthan when I started this journey.\n\nIt\'s just that my wrists hurt.\n\nThat\'s the only reason why things aren\'t going great.\n\nEven after running to the drugstore\n\nto pick up some compression braces,\n\nmy gaming didn\'t improve.\n\nIt didn\'t make any sense.\n\nI had spent over a week building this gamer space,\n\nwhich included dozens of minutes playing VALORANT.\n\nWhy wasn\'t I any better?\n\nThe space isn\'t perfect yet.\n\nThat\'s the only explanation.\n\nI hadn\'t reached my goal of being a better PC gamer.\n\nBut I also hadn\'t run out of sponsor money.\n\nIt was time for a second pass.\n\nMy single monitor wasn\'t giving me\n\nenough screen real estate for what really mattered:\n\nMy stream setup.\n\nSo I got a second one, and also some nice lights.\n\nWe have now upgraded our new space.\n\nI can now see my game, and I can also see\n\nwhat my stream setup\'s gonna be.\n\nIt\'s lookin\' good.\n\nEnough.\n\nBut good enough is never enough\n\nwhen one is striving for perfection.\n\nThe problem with streaming is that most people are okay\n\nwith one camera and one game.\n\nI am an auteur who understand the importance\n\nof cilimintography, and if I\'m supposed to stream\n\nin a manner that matches my ourverver,\n\nI NEED.\n\nMORE.\n\nCAMERAS.\n\nSadly, pretty much every webcam is currently sold out.\n\nI was running low on time,\n\nand that\'s one thing sponsor money can\'t buy.\n\nBut it can buy enterprise level\n\nvideo conferencing solutions.\n\nJust wanted to check in really quickly\n\nto let you know that\n\nI am unstoppable!\n\n*CACKLING*\n\n- [Roommate] Brian!\n\n- Sorry.\n\nI figured out how to do three cams on OBS,\n\nand now I can play a game.\n\nWhich is great, except looking at the overlay,\n\nit\'s a little busy.\n\nOur little test proved that there were\n\ntwo big issues with our space.\n\nThe first was that the cameras took up most of the screen.\n\nThe second is that my roommates didn\'t enjoy hearing me yell,\n\nwhich is nothing new.\n\nBut that\'s when it hit me.\n\nI have a plan on how to kill two birds with one stone:\n\nBy recycling all of the boxes I\'ve received.\n\nIf I could create a soundproof box around my gamer space\n\nand cover it in a green screen,\n\nthen I\'d have more screen space\n\nand my roommates would stop yelling at me.\n\nSo I used more of my sponsorship money\n\nto buy a bunch of expensive studio foam,\n\nand I taped it to a bunch of cardboard.\n\nAnd then I threw a green screen over the top of it\n\nand viola, a hermetically sealed gamer space.\n\nNow, a few of you might be wondering,\n\n"How does one get into this space?"\n\nBut you\'ll see that right behind my air conditioning unit,\n\nthere\'s a way that I can crawl underneath there.\n\nAnd the best part about it, it\'s not even dark\n\nbecause we\'ve got the... I put in the LEDs!\n\nAll I have to do is just weasel my way in.\n\nThey say, "No pain, no gain."\n\nAnd you know, I\'m a gamer\n\n"No pame, no game."\n\nMaybe that\'s better than my current slogan.\n\nOh, get the head through first,\n\n\'cause that\'s the hardest part of it, you know.\n\nJust kinda like...\n\nbeing born.\n\nAh, okay.\n\nOh.\n\nDo a quick one 180.\n\nAnd then you swap up, and then you\'re here.\n\nAnd then you\'re in the,\n\n(sighs) and then you\'re in the gamer space.\n\nAs easy as pie.\n\nAfter a vigorous four-minute entrance,\n\nit was clear that things were working out great.\n\nCheck this out!\n\nLook, there\'s so much I can,\n\nyou can see the whole UI.\n\nSo there is the problem of these screens.\n\nI spend a lot of time trying to make sure\n\nthat I had a cool-looking background.\n\nSuch is the curse of the green screen.\n\nThough you can put anything behind it,\n\nsometimes you are left with the void.\n\nI worked so hard to make sure\n\nthat my background expressed my gamerhood,\n\nand the gamer box just covered it up.\n\nI wanted to digitally recreate it,\n\nbut since I had three cameras it would have to be in 3D.\n\nSo I reached out to my coworker Jenna\n\nto mock something up in Blender for me,\n\nbased on some previous images I had of my gamer space.\n\nOkay, so we just got the new background set up.\n\nLet\'s get up in here!\n\nAlrighty, okay.\n\n(grunting) Okay!\n\nI can...\n\nShit.\n\n(groans) My shirt got caught on a thing.\n\nThis was a rude awakening, but a necessary one.\n\nMy current clothing setup was not compatible\n\nwith the gaming rig, so I figured out a new way\n\nto kill two birds with one stone.\n\nThe idea came from my compression braces.\n\nMy wrists felt so much better while compressed,\n\nand it made me wonder:\n\nWhat if all of me was compressed?\n\nSo I looked up those tactical black skin suits\n\nthat athletes wear in the Olympics,\n\nbut I was running dangerously low on time and money\n\nso I had to order from a less-than-scrupulous vendor.\n\nAnd when it finally arrived it was not to my specifications.\n\nI didn\'t have any more time.\n\nThe deadline was fast approaching.\n\nSo I dealt with what I had,\n\ncrawled into my sweltering gamer space and--\n\nI see what the problem is now.\n\nMy new compression suit was causing me\n\nto dissolve into Jenna\'s wonderful background.\n\nSo I asked her to remodel it,\n\nthis time with a 3D photorealistic virtual Brian\n\nthat I could superimpose my face onto.\n\nAnd the worst part of it was that--\n\nAnd I forgot my snacks!\n\nBut in all tribulations there is a chance for greatness,\n\nand greatness was found with a little inspiration,\n\na little heat exhaustion\n\nand the very last of my sponsorship money.\n\nI\'m covered head to toe in this important green screen,\n\nand I don\'t want this to get marred, obviously.\n\nSo what I\'ve come up with,\n\ninstead of having to eat toast with my hands,\n\nis that I\'ve purchased\n\na horse feedbag.\n\nAnd I was worried about, you know,\n\nmy hot milk is gonna start to cool down.\n\nAnd my computer right now is running a little bit hot, too.\n\nWhy don\'t I just kill two birds with one stone?\n\nThere are tons of liquid-cooled computers out there,\n\nand if I use this tubing, I can feed the cool milk\n\nthrough the PC, cooling it down perfectly,\n\nup around my headset, over the microphone.\n\nOkay, I got my feedbag, which will allow me to eat my snacks\n\nand then I\'ve got my warm milk, which is also\n\ngonna be cooling my computer in the box.\n\nI\'ll have my snacks and I\'ll have my box,\n\nand I can stay in there.\n\nWith the invention of the milk-cooled PC, patent pending,\n\nand the feedback-sustained me, patent pending,\n\nthe perfect gamer space was complete.\n\nOkay.\n\n(grunts) Hello!\n\nGamers.\n\nI have my feedbag, I tossed it over beforehand.\n\nThe crown of it all,\n\nmy milk-cooled PC.\n\n(Brian panting)\n\nLet\'s get gamin\'.\n\nThought the feedbag worked wonders,\n\nI was still doing poorly in my matches.\n\nI was getting flustered and couldn\'t focus,\n\nbut that\'s nothing a little warm milk couldn\'t help.\n\nCome on! (groans)\n\nSee, I don\'t get, oh, no no no no no, stop!\n\nNo no no, uh, shit!\n\nShit, shit!\n\nAh!\n\nOh, this is bad!\n\nThis is very bad!\n\nThis is very bad!\n\nAfter mopping up the MILK MSTR\'s lactose coolant fluid\n\nand toweling myself off,\n\nI broke out the gaming laptop I borrowed from work\n\nand sat back down in my original VALORANT test position.\n\nAnd I was better.\n\nWithout the lights and the monitors\n\nand the hands-free snacks,\n\nI was gaming better on a coffee table\n\nthan in my dedicated space.\n\nSo did I screw up\n\nand kill too many birds with too few stones?\n\nOr was I a less than perfect gamer?\n\nPerhaps I was asking a toddler to pilot a helicopter.\n\nThere\'s nothing wrong with\n\nmy hot cardboard box of gaming perfection.\n\nI simply was not ready to handle it responsibly.\n\nOne day, I will reenter that cocoon\n\nand emerge a wonderful gaming butterfly.\n\nBut before I grow my wings,\n\nthis little grub must learn to crawl.\n\nAnd also how to defuse the spike without dying.\n\nIt seems impossible.\n\nHas anyone done it yet?\n\nI doubt anyone\'s done that yet.\n\nThat\'s ridiculous.\n\n(cheery music)\n\nOh, I\'m so dumb.\n\nI screwed it in the wrong way.\n\n- [Karen] I didn\'t wanna say nothin\'.\n\n- You didn\'t wanna say nothin\'?\n\n- [Karen] Well, I looked at it and I knew.\n\n- You looked at it and you knew?\n\n- [Karen] Yeah. (laughs)\n\n- And you didn\'t say nothin\'?\n\nNo! ', ' Kingdom Hearts 3 is finally here.\n\nAnd I have received an excessive amount of requests to explain the storyline.\n\nThat seems perfectly reasonable.\n\nYou want to be caught up before you hop into the third game.\n\nBut judging by the wording on a few of these requests, it seems like I have a…\n\nTALL TASK\n\nahead of me.\n\nBut could I possibly help you understand the gargantuan, magnificent,\n\nepic storyline of Kingdom Hearts?\n\nYou sweet summer child.\n\nYou babe swaddled in the cashmere blanket of ignorance.\n\nYOU ASK TOO LITTLE OF ME.\n\nBecause not only can I help you understand Kingdom Hearts.\n\nBut I will give you the tools necessary to understand any story you are ever faced with\n\nfor the rest of your life.\n\n*music plays*\n\nPlease, oh baby, don’t go.\n\n~Simple and clean is the way that you\'re making me feel tonight.~\n\n*CLAP CLAP*\n\nSpoiler Warning!\n\nI’m about to explain the entirety of the Kingdom Hearts series.\n\nNow, if you don’t want to be spoiled for all of the games released up until now…\n\nI don’t know why you clicked on this video.\n\nBecause I feel like the title kinda explained that that’s what I was gonna do.\n\nSo that’s on you.\n\nUh, but ALSO.\n\nPotential spoiler warning!\n\nYou see, when I explain the tools of the literary trade, I might just be able to accurately\n\npredict the true ending of Kingdom Hearts 3.\n\nNow, the game hasn’t been released yet, and I have not played it, but…\n\nConsider yourself warned.\n\nWe’re talking about the hero’s journey or the monomyth.\n\nThis is a concept that’s been around for a long time.\n\nBut it was popularized by a guy named Joseph Campbell back in 1949 when he released a book\n\ncalled The Hero with a Thousand Faces.\n\nCampbell inspired plenty of other creative writers and literary analysts, including a\n\nguy called Christopher Vogler, who wrote his own book in the 1990s.\n\nBut before that, in the 1980s, he was working as a story consultant for a little company\n\ncalled Disney.\n\nWhen he was there, he sent out a seven-page memo that basically broke down all the big\n\nideas from Campbell’s book into 12 simple steps to writing good stories.\n\nDid the memo work?\n\nI don’t know.\n\nWhy don’t you ask Timon and Pumbaa?\n\nThey…\n\nThey’re from the Lion King.\n\nThat was a movie that Disney Produced.\n\nA lot of people think it’s a great movie.\n\nKingdom Hearts as described by the monomyth.\n\nWe’ve got 12 stages up here, kinda like a clock.\n\nIt’s a story wheel.\n\nAnd I’ll go through piece by piece explaining Kingdom Hearts 1, so that way you can understand\n\nwhat these stages are.\n\nOnce you do understand these stages, you’ll be able to understand any story!\n\nBecause great writers, no matter how dense their sci-fi or fantasy world may be, use\n\nthese stages to help orient you.\n\nI’m talking Dune.\n\nHarry Potter.\n\nSpace Jam.\n\nNumber one, introduction in the ordinary world.\n\nIn Kingdom Hearts 1, this is when Sora, Riku, and Kairi are all just hanging out on Destiny\n\nIslands, doing normal kid stuff.\n\nCall to adventure.\n\nWhat’s this?\n\nWeird creatures showing up on the island?\n\nSora has a sword that’s also a key?\n\nRefusal of the call.\n\nNow we hit a bit of a hiccup here because he really does seem gung-ho to leave the island\n\nat some point.\n\nBut I don’t think he wanted to do it on these terms, so I’ll still call this a refusal.\n\nMeeting with the mentor.\n\nAt this point Sora is in Traverse Town, and he meets Leon, who ends up giving him some\n\nguidance on what he’s supposed to be doing.\n\nCrossing the threshold.\n\nOr as true literary critics call it…\n\nboarding the gummi ship.\n\nTests, allies, and enemies.\n\nThis is pretty much the entirety of the Disney worlds.\n\nYou’ll notice that a lot of times in these synopses of Kingdom Hearts,\n\npeople just skip over them.\n\nIt’s cause they all fit here.\n\nReaching the innermost cave.\n\nThis is such a pivotal moment in the story.\n\nIn Star Wars, this is when Luke goes into the cave and faces off against a shadow version\n\nof himself.\n\nAnd in Kingdom Hearts, this is when Sora goes into Hollow Bastion so he can fight Riku, who is\n\nactually being possessed by Ansem, who is the Heartless version of Terra-Xehanort, who\n\nwas originally Terra but was then possessed by Xehanort before him.\n\nSame thing.\n\nEnduring the supreme ordeal.\n\nAfter Sora has faced off against Ansem the first time, he has to stab his own heart with\n\na keyblade, so that way he can release it and save Kairi.\n\nThat’s a supreme ordeal.\n\nSeizing the sword.\n\nNow this is not a literal sword.\n\nObviously, Sora already has one of those.\n\nBut instead it’s the reward or the power that Sora can take with him.\n\nSo in this case, it’s him being resurrected, having all of the princesses of heart saved,\n\nand having the power to defeat Ansem.\n\nThe road back.\n\nAnsem has been defeated by Kingdom Hearts being opened and him being ripped apart by\n\nthe light.\n\nAnd they are able to seal the doors, but unfortunately, they lose two of their friends in the process.\n\nResurrection.\n\nYeah, Sora did get literally resurrected a few stages before this.\n\nUh, but this is more of a metaphysical resurrection.\n\nThem finally coming back from the brink.\n\nKairi going back to Destiny Islands.\n\nReturn with the elixir.\n\nSora, Donald, and Goofy all go back out, using their combined experience to try to save Mickey\n\nand Riku.\n\nAnd that\'s Kingdom Hearts!\n\nThat was pretty painless, don\'t you think?\n\nBut granted, that\'s not what people have an issue with.\n\nPeople have an issue with all of the overarching story of Kingdom Hearts.\n\nBut, again, as long as we stick to these 12 stages, we should be able to take this apart,\n\npiece by piece.\n\nAnd though I am gonna stick with the 12 stages, I am gonna add just, uh, one little extra piece.\n\nIt\'s called historical background.\n\nThis is like The Silmarillion.\n\nOr JK Rowling\'s twitter.\n\nIn Kingdom Hearts, this would be Union Cross, or Chi, or whatever the many names of this\n\nweb/mobile game ended up being.\n\nDie-hard fans will get upset with me if I say this doesn\'t really matter to Sora\'s overarching story.\n\nBut I\'m gonna say it anyway.\n\nSo this historical background is gonna just be up here.\n\nAnd all of that knowledge is just gonna kind of bleed immediately into Kingdom Hearts 1.\n\nPat (offscreen): Uh, nope, you gotta do Birth by Sleep.\n\nPat: It\'s a prequel.\n\nBrian: But, is Sora in it?\n\nPat: No.\n\nNo Sora.\n\nBrian: Who\'s this guy, then?\n\nPat: That\'s Vanitas.\n\nBrian: Why?\n\nSo I, uh, seem to have neglected, uh, like three other heroes\' journeys in this hero\'s journey.\n\nSo I\'m just gonna...\n\nI\'m gonna move these over a little bit so that way I can have a bit more space.\n\nWe, we do have to talk about Birth by Sleep.\n\nStarting first with Terra\'s.\n\nUm, now imagine it has all twelve of the stages of the hero\'s journey, I just didn\'t want\n\nto write \'em all out, \'cause he gets norted, so he\'s not that good of a hero.\n\nSame goes for Aqua, which is intersecting with Terra\'s.\n\nAnd then we\'ve got Ventus, who has the biggest bearing on Sora\'s hero\'s journey.\n\nIt means that it has to not only intersect over here with Terra and Aqua.\n\nBut, I\'m sorry Vogler, I am gonna have to include another step on your hero\'s journey.\n\nSo here we\'ve got the Ventus Diagram, uh, which intersects here at step point five.\n\nThe part of the hero\'s journey, uh, where the baby hero\'s heart goes and saves another boy.\n\nThat\'s the only big change we\'re gonna do to Vogler\'s story wheel.\n\nUh, everything else is gonna make sense in Kingdom Hearts.\n\nAnd now we\'re going to take the wheel, uh, as if it is the overarching story of the entirety\n\nof the games.\n\nSo Kingdom Hearts, the first one, instead of going from 1 all the way to 12, is actually\n\njust gonna go from 0.5 to 5.\n\nAnd then we start 5 immediately at Kingdom Hearts 2, which will begin with Sora...\n\nPat (offscreen): Nope.\n\nBrian: What do you mean nope?\n\nPat: There\'s two more.\n\nOnce again I seem to have neglected a few, uh, interstitial pieces of Kingdom Hearts.\n\nChain of Memories and also three five eight days over two.\n\nWhich is a totally normal title.\n\nIt\'s totally fine, because it just fleshes out Sora\'s hero\'s journey.\n\nAnd also... a different guy and his name is Roxas.\n\n*pained expression*\n\nI went ahead and I categorized Chain of Memories as a "hero\'s journey redux"\n\nsince Sora is just fighting against his own memories, the things that he has remembered\n\nfrom the past hero\'s journey.\n\nSo it\'s just gonna hang out around here.\n\nAnd then we have 358/2 Days, which follows Roxas, who is Sora\'s Nobody.\n\nAnd a Nobody is like the shell of a person after they\'ve released their heart.\n\n358/2 Days happens then, and since it\'s the hero\'s Nobody, it\'s actually within the hero\'s\n\njourney, doing its own thing.\n\nUm, and, I\'m gonna call this 4.5 remix.\n\nThis is a pivotal part of the hero\'s journey when, uh, the hero\'s shadow self goes off\n\nand eats ice cream.\n\nThese two are tied together by a character named Xion, who works in Organization XIII\n\nwith Roxas, and also is made from the memories... of Sora.\n\nShe doesn\'t really have like a hero\'s journey...\n\nI\'ll just tie it out for you.\n\nAnd since this oblong actually crosses through the hero\'s journey twice, we\'re gonna make\n\nthis easy to remember and call it the\n\n"Hero\'s Memories of the Hero\'s Journey Double Cross Oblong."\n\nOr HMHJXXO.\n\nIn Kingdom Hearts 2, we start out with Roxas and Sora, and Roxas is on summer vacation.\n\nWe\'re gonna have him start over here and just kind of go all the way up to enduring the\n\nsupreme ordeal, where he finally gives up his body to Sora so Sora can be whole.\n\nAnd we\'re just gonna call that "The Antihero\'s Cradle."\n\nAlright, so, we\'re done with Roxas, we\'re back with Sora.\n\nSo this should be a breeze.\n\nKingdom Hearts 2.\n\nAlright, he\'s already crossed the threshold.\n\nHe does the tests, allies, and enemies.\n\nThat\'s just the Disney stuff, we\'re gonna skip it.\n\nHe goes over, reaches the innermost cave, that would be the World that Never Was, where\n\nhe faces off against the supreme ordeal.\n\nXemnas, Organization XIII.\n\nSeizes the sword.\n\nHe gets the power to close Kingdom Hearts.\n\nAnd then finally, the road back.\n\nThey get home.\n\nThey get a letter from King Mickey, the contents of which will be revealed in...\n\nKingdom Hearts 3?\n\nPat (offscreen): No.\n\nFUCK!\n\nALRIGHT ASSHOLES.\n\nI have no more space here, so I made you a DATA CUBE.\n\nARE YA HAPPY?\n\nThe data cube contains the entirety of Kingdom Hearts Coded, which is all in a virtual space.\n\nThe data cube is that thing where the hero goes on a journey into his inner thoughts\n\nand finds some data that an old guy put in him.\n\nIt\'s that THING THAT HAPPENS IN THE HERO\'S JOURNEY.\n\nAnd then at the same time, we also have Dream Drop Distance, which... is another hero\'s\n\njourney inside of the hero\'s journey, and it\'s part of seizing the sword.\n\nBecause they have to go... into sleeping versions of the world\'s they\'ve already been to.\n\nBut also maybe they\'re... they\'re going into each other\'s dreams?\n\nAnd one of them is...\n\nNo, it doesn\'t fit here, I\'ve got a better...\n\nThere\'s another part of the hero\'s journey, and it\'s called the Dream Drop Bucket.\n\nAnd it\'s where you put the Dream Drop Distance until you need it later, and hopefully you won\'t.\n\nThat brings us up to Kingdom Hearts 3.\n\nGranted, I thought when I started this, I would be able to...\n\nperfectly predict, uh, Kingdom Hearts 3.\n\nBut, I don\'t know, I feel like I"m just missing something.\n\n*CAUSE He GeTs NOrTEd.*\n\n*BeING POsESSed bY AnSEM.*\n\n*By XeHAnORT.*\n\n*CAUSE HE GETS NORTED.*\n\nI forgot about the villain\'s journey.\n\nThe villain\'s tridecagon.\n\nThe villain\'s tridecagon is definitely the key.\n\nThe tridecagon of villainy.\n\nThis is a 13-sided shape that goes one further than dodecagon of the hero\'s journey.\n\nWe have almost entirely ignored Xehanort.\n\nHe is the impetus for all of the anger and anguish in Sora\'s life.\n\nAnd so he deserves a wheel as well.\n\nWe have to start at the very beginning of Xehanort.\n\nAnd that starts in stage one of all villains.\n\nYou have to be contacted by a future version of yourself.\n\nThat brings us to stage two.\n\nIt gives you the ability to time travel.\n\nAnd that\'s what this means.\n\nThis special string just shows that they can go wherever they want to in time.\n\nStep three, you need to learn about a great power.\n\nThis is when Xehanort first discovers Kingdom Hearts and all of the power it could hold.\n\nWhat do you do after you find out about that power?\n\nYou nort a boy.\n\nOnce you\'ve got that boy under your possession, time to get real into unethical science.\n\nThat\'s when you\'re going to learn all about Kingdom Hearts and how to release people\'s hearts.\n\nThat means you can become a guinea pig yourself, therefore creating two versions of yourself.\n\nA Nobody and a Heartless.\n\nBut are you happy with just those two versions of yourself?\n\nYou shouldn\'t be!\n\n\'Cause you\'re a villain.\n\nThat\'s right, it\'s time for nort boy redux.\n\nStage eight.\n\nThis is when Ansem, the Heartless version of Terra-Xehanort, the original norted boy\n\nform, takes control of Riku.\n\nAnd now that you\'re jazzed and ready to go, time to fail.\n\nYou do have to fail once, uh, in order to succeed later as a villain.\n\nBut don\'t let that failure get you down, it\'s time for stage 10.\n\nYou develop an organization to trick young boy into committing Heartless genocide in order to create\n\na new pseudo version of that great power you discovered back in stage three.\n\nAnd then you fail again.\n\nBut guess what!\n\nIt\'s time travel time.\n\nYour young self is gonna help you out by coming from over in step two to step 12.\n\nYou just do the same tenth step again, except instead of using other people, you use 13\n\nversions of your own self.\n\nWhich leads us to the thirteenth point in the tridecagon.\n\nThe villain\'s variable.\n\nYou\'re either gonna win, or you\'re gonna lose.\n\nThis is the thing that we were missing.\n\nThe villain\'s variable is what will tie together the rest of story.\n\nIt\'s what will help us understand what will happen in Kingdom Hearts 3.\n\nAnd judging by the villain\'s tridecagon, I can say that I don\'t believe Sora will seal\n\naway the darkness.\n\nIn fact I expect Xehanort to win...\n\nby norting Sora.\n\nAnd then think of the repercussions of this.\n\nDonald will kill Goofy by throwing him off a dock.\n\nRiku will start cutting his own bangs.\n\nKairi will continue to not matter.\n\nIt\'s so much more interesting.\n\nIt\'s the true way that this story should end.\n\nAnd I think this is what people want.\n\nThis is the modern hero\'s journey.\n\nThe true thing that all stories should follow from here on out.\n\nAs Utada Hikaru would say: Simple and clean.\n\nSo the next time someone tells you, "I don\'t understand Kingdom Hearts!"\n\nYou say, "Hey Bucko.\n\nI think what you don\'t understand is basic storytelling."\n\nBasic storytelling.\n\nDid that work?\n\nI don\'t know.\n\nAsk...\n\nAladdin.\n\nDid the memo work?\n\nWhy don\'t you ask Sebastian the crab. *sings Under the Sea*\n\nYou nort a boy.\n\n*laughing*\n\nPat (offscreen): Ohhh no. ', ' *cheerful music*\n\nKirby!\n\nThis pink puffball has been sucking his way through the denizens of Dream Land since 1992.\n\nHe has his own games, manga, tv series, and toys.\n\nIt’s safe to say he’s one of Nintendo’s most trusted mascots.\n\nBut he should not be trusted.\n\nThe problem with Kirby is that he is simultaneously Nintendo’s simplest and most powerful creature.\n\nThose two realities cannot coexist.\n\nHe is a life form with neither the ambition nor the intelligence to make decisions,\n\nand yet the world bends to his will.\n\nAlthough it appears that Kirby is just a vacuous pastel marshmallow,\n\nthere must be some hidden wisdom that grants him the power he wields.\n\nThere has to be.\n\nKirby’s incongruity is terrifying,\n\nbut that’s only because we are terrified of things we do not yet understand.\n\nAnd today, we are going to understand.\n\n"Scientia potentia est.” Knowledge is Power.\n\nHumankind’s attempts to harness the powers of the natural world\n\ncome from intense research and understanding of those powers.\n\nAnd yet Kirby is granted powers well beyond his station.\n\nWhat powers, you ask? Allow me to show you.\n\nI have created two columns here: Simplicity, and Power.\n\nWhat Kirby is, versus What Kirby can do.\n\nBy mapping the dichotomy of these two columns, we can peel back the facade of Kirby’s simplicity,\n\nand figure out what’s really going on.\n\nBecause, again, this is not normal.\n\nLet’s begin with simplicity.\n\nMost people know Kirby as that cute little round guy, but is there more to him?\n\nAccording to official, canonical information:\n\nno.\n\nDoes this sound like an apex predator?\n\nEven a bear enjoys a satisfying back-scratch.\n\nThis sounds like the lowest form of life,\n\nsomeone who is stuck on the base of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs.\n\nHe wakes up, eats his caloric intake for the day,\n\nand falls asleep watching The Great British Bake Off.\n\nAnd yet, over here on the power column...\n\nThe things Kirby eats are completely obliterated.\n\nNot just converted into something else, completely gone.\n\nKirby only cares about eating and sleeping.\n\nAnd yet, he gains no energy nor pleasure from consuming these things.\n\nInstead, he just lets them disappear.\n\nGone from this plane of existence.\n\nSo…\n\nwhat the fuck.\n\nKirby doesn’t speak a language beyond saying the words “Poyo,”\n\nand “Hi!”\n\nKirby mostly communicates via body language and grunts.\n\nEven toddlers are more communicative.\n\nBy all accounts, he is either incapable of, or uninterested in, speaking language.\n\nAnd yet Kirby is an incredibly skilled technician.\n\nWe see Kirby piloting mechs, and if anime is to believed,\n\nand I believe anime,\n\nthis can only be accomplished by gifted teens grappling with psychosexual ennui.\n\nHe can effortlessly turn himself into a fighter jet,\n\nsomething that only the most skilled air force engineers have mastered.\n\nHow can he understand these complex mechanical processes,\n\nwithout having the language skill to read a textbook\n\nor the "I fucking love science" facebook page?\n\nKirby’s origins are vague.\n\nLet me take a moment to move over to a different board so I can show you Kirby’s origin story.\n\nThere’s NOTHING HERE.\n\nVery little is known about Kirby’s origin.\n\nHe has no canonical species. He has no canonical age.\n\nMasahiro Sakurai, Kirby’s alleged creator,\n\nhas stated he does not remember how Kirby got his name.\n\nKirby was originally a placeholder sprite,\n\nset to be replaced by something....\n\nMore!\n\nBut no. Kirby survived. Kirby came from nothing.\n\nAnd Kirby is nothing.\n\nOr is he everything.\n\nBecause Kirby can be anything.\n\nHis copy ability gives him the powers and appearance of any creature he consumes.\n\nBut copy is a misnomer.\n\nHe does not duplicate his enemies.\n\nHe assimilates and replaces them.\n\nIn Smash, he takes the power of his foes, and then the foe is released as a sign of respect.\n\nBut in every other iteration of Kirby, the thing he consumes is destroyed in the process.\n\nDoes he absorb their DNA? Does he absorb their memories?\n\nIs he the keeper of their souls?\n\nAll of these abilities point to Kirby being intelligently designed, which we know is not the case.\n\nSakurai fucking woke up in a crop circle with the name “Kirby” carved into his arm.\n\nKirby has no emotional intelligence. No relationships.\n\nIn the anime, Kirby seems to harbor no ill will toward King Dedede or Escargoon,\n\nhis main two antagonists.\n\nHe faces baby birds and full battalions of soldiers with the same vacant grin.\n\nHe eats and destroys indiscriminately, but counts no one among his enemies.\n\nBut those who count him among theirs…\n\nare cosmic horrors.\n\nLook at this thing.\n\nLook at this thing!\n\nThese celestial powers probably have wants and needs far beyond our human comprehension,\n\nand yet they trouble themselves with the destruction of Kirby,\n\na barely living kickball.\n\nWhat do they see in Kirby that scares them?\n\nWhat could scare this?\n\nAnd the final simple evidence, Kirby is shaped like a friend.\n\nThis was the opening of Kirby’s Adventure. Let me show you something.\n\nWhat did you notice?\n\nThat’s right. For the entire time I was drawing this,\n\nI WASN’T INTERROGATING the true nature of Kirby.\n\nThis quote is cute and simple and a blatant misdirection.\n\nIt is a patronizing errand is meant to keep people like me from uncovering the truth.\n\nThe truth that Kirby possesses infinite power.\n\nAnd that is a quote.\n\nPlanet Robobot explicitly states that Kirby possesses infinite power.\n\nKirby can ride a star. Kirby can punch through a planet.\n\nKirby is the only being in the entirety of the universe that survived the Galeem cataclysm.\n\nA circle survived.\n\nTHIS SURVIVED.\n\nHOW?\n\n*deep breath*\n\nNow that we’ve addressed these two columns, it is time to bridge the gap.\n\nHow can we reconcile the two canonical truths of Kirby:\n\nthat he is both nothing and everything.\n\nHow can this sentient garbage bag accomplish so much?\n\nLet me tell you...\n\nI don’t know.\n\nI literally have no clue how this dumb fucking orb can have so much power.\n\nI have worked my whole life researching and gaining knowledge,\n\nand this dipshit sphere sleeps all day and has powers that gods fear.\n\nAnd that’s impossible.\n\nIt should be impossible.\n\nThere has to be an answer here and I don’t see it and that’s NOT FAIR.\n\nIf knowledge is power, then power should be knowledge,\n\nand Kirby is everything and he should know everything,\n\nand yet we know nothing!\n\nI can’t think in here.\n\nI’m going outside!\n\nHow do I get outside?\n\nKirby!\n\nThe mystery of this florid Dream Landian has baffled me,\n\nbut I\'ve taken a few months, and I\'ve collected my thoughts,\n\nand I’m back in the studio to deliver my findings.\n\nKirby’s incongruity is terrifying, but that’s only because we are terrified of things we do not yet understand.\n\nAnd today, for real,\n\nwe are going to understand.\n\nIf you’ll recall from our first exploration of the rosy nightmare,\n\nthe problem with Kirby is that he is both incredibly simple and incredibly powerful.\n\nIn the intervening five months, I’ve learned a few pieces of information that contradict a few of my points.\n\nFirst, Kirby can speak a language.\n\nThere was a Drama CD released in Japan in 1994 where Kirby speaks full sentences.\n\nBut in this, he says that a phone is “mysterious” and he doesn’t know how it works.\n\nAnd yet, he can pilot a mech.\n\nTwo, Kirby’s name does in fact have a backstory,\n\neven if Sakurai was too fuckin\' zooted to remember it.\n\nKirby was named after John Kirby, a lawyer who passed away last year,\n\nwho defended Nintendo’s right to copyright Donkey Kong back in the ‘80s.\n\nBut this doesn’t make the rest of Kirby\'s origin any less vague,\n\nand it doesn\'t change the fact that a creature cannot possibly embody both of these truths.\n\nBut that’s the problem.\n\nI’ve been thinking of Kirby as a creature.\n\nConsider, for a moment, Moby Dick.\n\nYou might receive this book in your English class and say,\n\n"Hell yeah! A big ol’ whale?\n\nI can’t wait to see Ahab level up and hit that big boy right in his weak points.\n\nAnd sure, he puts his harpoon up in Moby D’s flanks,\n\nbut spoiler alert!\n\nAhab gets got,\n\neven though he’s been grinding for, like, years\n\nand Pale Whale\'s just a dipshit fish with a thing for sailor feet.\n\nAnd so you say this to Ms. Mahoney and she’s like,\n\n“Brian, don’t you get it? The whale is a metaphor for…\n\nsomething,”\n\nand then you write that on your final exam and you pass the class.\n\nThis is what I like to call “The Bookman’s Bluff.”\n\nIt’s when an author creates something, and people are like,\n\n“Hey, that doesn’t make sense,”\n\nbut then the author says,\n\n“Well, it does make sense if you consider it’s actually a metaphor.”\n\nHere, I believe that Sakurai is pulling a Bookman’s Bluff.\n\nKirby, like Moby Dick, doesn’t make sense as a creature,\n\nbut he will make sense as a metaphor.\n\nSo what does Kirby symbolize?\n\nLet’s take a look at some common metaphors.\n\nLet\'s start with the seven deadly sins since everyone and their mother is basing characters on them.\n\nUnfortunately, none of them really make sense for Kirby.\n\nWrath, no way. Greed, he’s not in it for the money.\n\nI\'m gonna skip over lust.\n\nYou could make an argument for Gluttony because he eats a lot.\n\nSloth, he sleeps a lot. And Envy, he\'s constantly copying other people.\n\nBut he never does it with any malice. Kirby does these things haphazardly,\n\nwithout any sense of what he\'s doing.\n\nAnd then there’s Pride.\n\nNow, pride is the sin from which all other sins arise,\n\nand its punishment in hell is being broken upon the wheel,\n\nbut Kirby is a wheel, so that ain’t gonna work.\n\nBut Kirby might symbolize someone else’s pride...\n\nThe Hubris of Humanity.\n\nThink about it.\n\nHas humanity ever paused to consider that perhaps our endless consumption\n\nmay not be a good move for the world as a whole?\n\nHave we altered our course or simply continued to eat and sleep and copy others\n\nwithout any thought of the repercussions?\n\nIn fact, perhaps we can go one step further. Kirby is a metaphor for capitalism!\n\nDoes our capitalist society assimilate and destroy?\n\nAbsolutely!\n\nTechnical and cultural appropriation are two of capitalism’s most trusted tools.\n\nWhen it comes to a lack of emotional intelligence,\n\ncapitalism makes people willing to suck in and obliterate anything,\n\nfriend or foe, nation or natural wonder, so long as it makes money.\n\nIs capitalism’s enemy a cosmic horror?\n\nWhat could be more cosmically horrifying to a capitalist society\n\nthan a guy called Marx.\n\nKIRBY IS A METAPHOR FOR CAPITALISM.\n\nSure, capitalism can sometimes be more cruel in its intentions than Kirby can manage.\n\nThat is... I\'ll take that.\n\nUh, also, it sure as hell feels like it could burn out at any second,\n\nso the infinite power thing: not 100% true.\n\nUm, and,\n\nvery-it\'s a-it’s hard to describe capitalism as being shaped like a friend…\n\nand the whole eating and sleeping only is...\n\nit doesn’t really make sense \'cause we have a hyper fixation on productivity and that being tied to worth…\n\nso that doesn\'t...\n\nThis is not a very good metaphor, is it?\n\nIn fact, most of these metaphors are bullshit.\n\nEspecially this one.\n\nI thought I could take five months and pause and contemplate,\n\nand then I\'d come back, and I\'d have the perfect explanation for the dichotomy of Kirby,\n\nbut nothing has changed.\n\nThis horrifying bolus slips through my fingers again.\n\nMaybe I’m just not good at this...\n\nJenna, can you...\n\nI need you to keep my papers and push pins safe. I’m gonna go away for awhile…\n\nI\'m gonna find Kirby.\n\nJenna: Okay. Good luck bud.\n\nI went to the woods because I wished to front only the essential facts of Kirby.\n\nI wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life,\n\njust as Kirby might suck a Waddle Dee into his gullet.\n\nI’ve been at it for a while now.\n\nJudging by the length of my beard, I’ve been living out here for 2, maybe 3 years?\n\nThere are no pin boards in the forest.\n\nI don’t have three cameras to catch my every side glance.\n\nThey don\'t teach you th...\n\nIt’s just me. And nature,\n\nwhich has reduced me to my base instincts.\n\nI only care about finding food and shelter,\n\neating and sleeping.\n\nI am become Kirby.\n\nI wish I could say this has given me a clear mind, but no,\n\nnature has broken me.\n\nI am confounded by it.\n\nAnd we are terrified of things we do not yet understand.\n\nKirby is nature!\n\n...I thought, after spending my first day out in the woods.\n\nSure, nature’s origins are still murky,\n\nand what is evolution if not a really, really slow form of Kirby’s copy ability?\n\n*inhaling*\n\nAnd much like Kirby, Nature is neither cruel nor kind:\n\nit doles out boons and punishments indiscriminately.\n\nFor every delicious handful of berries,\n\nit also gives a completely unrelated bout of diarrhea.\n\nBut it took me only a few days to realize that this was another dead end.\n\nNature doesn’t destroy matter, or possess infinite power,\n\nand its enemy is not a cosmic horror,\n\nit’s us.\n\nI\'m sorry for using so much paper.\n\nSo I went back to the proverbial drawing board and have been stuck there ever since.\n\nNature is still terrifying to me.\n\nAnd it is certainly not shaped like a friend.\n\nHow can Kirby live like this and stay so joyful?\n\nHow can he only care about his base needs and conquer any enemies that come before him?\n\nI can’t conquer anything,\n\nnot even the mystery of a character from a children’s game.\n\nAll I can do is tumble listlessly through the wood,\n\nlike a star spat from Kirby’s maw.\n\n*waves crashing*\n\nI awake one morning upon the shore of a strange sea.\n\nI do not know where I am, nor how I came to be here.\n\nThe sea stretches endlessly in front of me,\n\nrevealing the gentle, Kirby-like curve of the planet,\n\nand I finally understand.\n\nI was so focused on investigating the inner machinations of this bulbous boy\n\nthat I never asked why I was investigating.\n\nI am tormented with an everlasting itch for things to mean something,\n\nbut Kirby didn’t need an explanation,\n\nI did.\n\nThere is no bullet point or fan wiki entry.\n\nKirby is not nature or a metaphor.\n\nKirby doesn’t need a dark backstory or a logical rationale.\n\nKirby is just Kirby.\n\nAs I stand here watching the waves lap against the sand\n\nmiles away from civilization,\n\nI realize I’m not simply standing on the edge of the ocean, but the edge of the world.\n\nA world I’ve accepted without knowing its hidden meaning.\n\nPerhaps there is no hidden meaning.\n\nPerhaps it’s better that way.\n\nPerhaps it’s time for me to go home.\n\n“First you draw a circle,\n\nthen you dot the eyes.\n\nAdd a great big smile,\n\nand presto, it’s Kirby.”\n\nKirby is an extremely strong circle,\n\nand that’s all the explanation I need.\n\nUnfortunately,\n\nthe same CANNOT BE SAID FOR DIDDY KONG.\n\nWHO GAVE HIM A GUN? DID HE BUILD THE JETPACK?\n\nTHAT DOESN\'T MAKE ANY SENSE, HE\'S A MONKEY, WHAT IS HE...\n\n*suit ripping* Ahhh yeah!\n\nThis is satisfying. If you get in on this, you want to...\n\nPat: Yeah.\n\nBrian: Roll... just put that in a bunch of dirt right now.\n\nI\'m gonna roll around a little bit.\n\n*you hear a bunch of scrounging around*\n\n*shirt ripping* Brian: Ohhhh incredible!\n\nPat: Are we gonna ride on the train like this to Coney Island?\n\nBrian: Yeah maybe! ', " Mario!\n\nHe can jump, he can dance,\n\nand he can successfully avoid conviction for war crimes.\n\nIt seems like the only thing he can’t do is settle down and just enjoy life for a bit.\n\nMario has been cleaning up messes in the Mushroom Kingdom and beyond since 1981.\n\nThat makes him almost 40 years old.\n\nMost 40-year-olds I know are paying off a mortgage, buying a Peloton,\n\nand desperately trying not to become their parents.\n\nBut Mario is still out there,\n\ngrinding at the same job,\n\nand also, every other job.\n\nDoesn’t Mario deserve some time off?\n\nDoesn’t he get a chance to kick up his heels?\n\nEnjoy a tropical drink while visiting the ol’ timeshare?\n\nAnd more specifically, hasn’t he made enough coins to let him coast for the rest of his life?\n\nThat’s why I’m here to give him a little financial advice…\n\n*ding!*\n\nAnd figure out when Mario can retire.\n\n*chalk board wheeling in*\n\nThank you both.\n\nWhy should Mario retire?\n\nYou might say “Mario loves his job,\n\nand when you love what you do, you never work a day in your life,”\n\nbut that's bullshit.\n\nI love what I do, and let me tell you something…\n\nI’ve worked some days.\n\n*threatening bass noise*\n\nI personally can’t wait to retire.\n\nAs soon as I hit 50, I'm gonna be out there on the beach,\n\npina colada in one hand, sci-fi novel in the other,\n\nsoaking up mother nature's cosmic rays.\n\nBut Mario has a history of risk-taking behavior, and\n\nit's possible he's planning to live fast, die young, and leave a beautiful, beautiful corpse.\n\nThat said, he’s made it out of every scrape so far,\n\nand ground pounding at age 86 is hard on the hips.\n\nMario needs a backup plan.\n\nNow, I’m not here to tell Mario how to live his life\n\n*ding*\n\nbut I can take a look at his finances\n\nand figure out when he’ll have enough money to finally hand Peach his resignation letter.\n\nFoolish ol’ me thought that I could just google “how much money do you need to retire”\n\nand there'd be a link that says “a million bucks,”\n\nbut no.\n\nTurns out that everyone needs a different amount to retire based on what you’re used to.\n\nIf you’re making millions every year, you’re gonna need a lot more to retire,\n\nbecause how else are you gonna support your dipshit failson’s bad business ideas?\n\nBut with all of the retirement calculators online, I was getting a little overwhelmed,\n\nso I decided to reach out to a qualified financial advisor.\n\n- Hi, my name’s Nate Choe, I’m a certified financial planner with Northwestern Mutual,\n\nand I basically help people answer questions about money.\n\n- That’s exactly what I need you to do today.\n\nThis call is not about me, um, I feel like I’m in a great spot right now in terms of my finances,\n\nbut I have some worries about my good friend, Mario.\n\nI was looking online to see if there was, like, just a number of money you need in order to retire,\n\nand it turns out that that’s not a thing that exists.\n\nHow do I figure out how much money you need to retire?\n\n- Yeah, yeah, um, there are a lot of different things that you’d need to know.\n\nAt the most basic level, you need to know how many years you’re going to spend in retirement.\n\nSo basically, when you’re gonna retire, and at what age you’re going to die.\n\n- So I have know, I have to be able to, uh,\n\nto just discern when I’m willing to croak, is what you’re saying.\n\n- Exactly, yes, you have to calculate a death at some point.\n\n- Alright. What if I’m never gonna die.\n\n- *chuckling* Then you’re never going to be able to retire.\n\nAnd then you’ll need to know how much money you’re going to spend every single month…\n\n- Okay…\n\n- And then Nate listed off a bunch of other very important pieces of retirement info\n\nand I paid close attention.\n\n- Got it, okay.\n\nI figure out how much money he’s gonna need per month, and then I’ll work backward from that,\n\nbased on how much money he can accrue, and then that will be how I can figure out when he can retire?\n\n- That work backwards model is actually what we do in the industry,\n\nbut we have to offset what he has against inflation as well.\n\n- Is there a minimum amount of money per month that you suggest people have for retirement?\n\n- Yeah, typically, what we’re talking about, like, the average American,\n\nit’s going to be about three thousand dollars a month, of today’s dollars.\n\n- I feel like Mario is a very humble man,\n\nand so I don’t think he’s going to need more than 3k a month, um,\n\njust to make it easier for me.\n\nSo now that I’ve got a basic gist of the information I need to calculate Mario’s retirement age,\n\nit’s time to collect the information.\n\nLet’s start with something easygoing\n\nand figure out when Mario's gonna die.\n\nTo keep things simple, we’ll assume that Mario was born the year he first made a game appearance.\n\nThis might not be perfectly accurate, but it would make him almost 39 years old,\n\nand that feels pretty right for a strangely smooth-skinned mustachioed man.\n\nThough current male life expectancy is around 80 years old,\n\nI personally can’t come to grips with the fact that Mario is halfway through his life,\n\nso I’ll be generous and say he’ll die at 90.\n\nHe’s spry.\n\nIn order to retire, Mario is going to need a monthly budget of at least three thousand US dollars,\n\nbut he uses coins.\n\nTons and tons of people have tried to figure out, how much a coin would be worth in US dollars,\n\nbut most of them have been thinking about coins as a solid gold object.\n\nJudging by the amount of coins you need to purchase simple objects in the Mushroom Kingdom,\n\nit seems like coins are not really worth that much.\n\nUsing Super Mario RPG as our guideline for a coin’s purchasing power,\n\nthe cheapest items are a mushroom and able juice: 4 coins a pop.\n\nShirt and pants are the cheapest nonconsumable items at 7 coins each.\n\nI wanted to compare these with the most expensive items in Super Mario RPG,\n\nbut I don’t think I can figure out the real world price of a fire bomb\n\nwithout getting put on a watch list.\n\nAfter doing some heavy research, I settled on a conversion rate of 1 coin to 8 US Dollars.\n\nGiven our 3k figure for retirement,\n\nthat just means Mario needs 375 coins a month, right?\n\nWRONG.\n\nSuper Mario RPG came out in 1996, and we haven’t accounted for inflation.\n\nThat’s why we gotta compare these prices to similar items Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga,\n\nwhich came out seven years later.\n\nI built my Mushroom Price Index on these six items, and just from a cursory glance,\n\nit’s obvious that the prices have gone up.\n\nBut to figure out by how much, we gotta head back to algebra two.\n\nThe pert equation!\n\nIt's something I learned about a very long time ago,\n\nand I’m pretty sure it’s used to figure out compounding interest.\n\nBasically, I gotta plug in some prices and do some natural logs and\n\nwhatever else the internet tells me to do,\n\nand it will leave me with an annual inflation rate for that item.\n\nThen I just gotta average out the rates and it’ll leave me with a workable annual inflation rate\n\nfor the Mushroom Kingdom as a whole.\n\nSo I’ll just go ahead and do that math in my head real quick.\n\n*thinking music*\n\nThank you, Clayton.\n\nNow, rounding that number up, that’s an average annual inflation rate of about 15% per year.\n\nWhich is… really high.\n\nThe US Federal Reserve tries to keep inflation at a healthy 2%,\n\nwhereas the Mushroom Kingdom Federal Reserve doesn’t exist\n\ndue to aggressive lobbying by Wario.\n\nIn order to understand this a bit better, I googled Mario hyperinflation,\n\nand I got some exciting search results\n\nthat were ultimately unhelpful.\n\nBut from what I gather, this means that if Mario spends 100 coins to buy a shirt this year,\n\nnext year, he'll have to spend a little more than 115 for the same shirt.\n\nIf inflation stayed the same from when Superstar Saga came out in 2003,\n\nwe can assume that by 2020, a simple mushroom is going to cost 128 coins.\n\nA pair of entry level pants will cost 2049 coins.\n\nSo that original 1-to-8 conversion rate doesn’t really make sense anymore.\n\nUsing those same 2020 price comparisons,\n\nthe conversion rate is more like 36 coins to 1 US Dollar.\n\nIf Mario retired today, he would need 108,000 coins per month.\n\n*MAMMA MIA!*\n\nBut let’s remember that Mario has been doing this for a long time. He’s definitely got a little something...\n\n... away. So I talked to Nate about his job and ways he might be saving money.\n\n- He has a bit of a strange job. He’s technically a plumber, I guess, in title?\n\n- Is he part of, like, the plumber’s union? Does he have a pension?\n\n- So I, I, I would be willing to bet he doesn’t have a pension just because, uh,\n\nI think he might be the only plumber?\n\nHe’s not being employed by anyone, necessarily. He’s just doing it and then finding his payment along the way.\n\n- Okay, so it sounds like he’s almost, like, a freelancer.\n\nIf he’s not getting W-2 income he can’t save into things like 401ks or Roth IRAs.\n\n- Now, when you say Roth IRA, what is that?\n\n- It’s a way to save for retirement.\n\nUm,\n\nyou know, as a young person you should definitely be doing one, trying to max it out every single year.\n\nIt’s crucial for, for retirement.\n\n- When…\n\nBut when you say crucial, do you…\n\ndo you mean optional?\n\nSo, maybe Mario doesn’t have a Rough IRA or a 4-in-1 Cake or whatever,\n\nbut no one has those. I don’t, and I’m well on my way to that beach chair in Boca!\n\nAnd the fact is that Mario can get a lot of coins in his games.\n\nHow else could he spend so much on go-karting and tennis?\n\nIn the most recent Mario games, the coin counter can only go up to 9,999,\n\nwhich is the maximum amount you can store in a mattress.\n\nSo let’s assume that Mario has been saving 10,000 coins every year since the release of Mario Odyssey.\n\nWe can assume that since he’s not in a union, he isn’t getting any raises to offset inflation.\n\nSo to finally figure out when Mario can retire, we need to know much money he’ll need every year before his death.\n\nFor example, if he lives to 90 years old, he’ll need 2.7 billion coins.\n\nWhich is the cost of living for just one year.\n\nBut we have to remember that he's been saving 10,000 coins for 54 years,\n\nwhich means that he would have 540 thousand coins saved up… Which is…\n\npoint zero two percent\n\nof what he needs to retire for just one year before his death.\n\nAnd actually, if the monthly cost of living is already 108 thousand coins,\n\nhe's gonna be unbelievably deep in debt…\n\nWhich is actually what Nate told me, via text.\n\nMario can never retire.\n\nYou know what, that’s bonkers though, because there's...\n\nthere’s no way that, you know, inflation's gonna stay that high for that long.\n\nIn fact, in later Mario and Luigi RPGs, the prices are the same or lower.\n\nSo let’s just assume that from here on out the inflation rate stays a healthy 2%.\n\nAnd you know what, let’s assume that Mario can save more than 10,000 coins a month.\n\nIn New Super Mario Bros. 2, the counter maxes out at one less than 10 million coins.\n\nGranted, this is an outlier, and a ridiculous one at that,\n\nbut so is spending 2.7 billion coins just to survive at age 90.\n\nThere’s no way you could spend that much on Werther’s Originals.\n\nSo let’s say he's saving 10 million coins a year since age 31,\n\nwhich, might I point out, is over a quarter of a million US Dollars.\n\nNow if we just add up the cost of living of each year leading up to 90,\n\nwe can see that Mario will have saved enough money to chill out on his boat at age…\n\n77.\n\nWhich is...\n\nis just one year below the average American male life expectancy…\n\n*I'M-A TIRED!*\n\nOkay, you know what,\n\njust for fun, let's just throw some random numbers in here, just to... just for...\n\njust to see, you know, just wheaa- just for fun!\n\nLet’s say Mario is starting to save money at, ppffff, I don’t know, my age, 26.\n\nThe inflation rate can stay the same, 2%,\n\nand let's just say that the coin ratio is actually just 1-to-1 with US dollars,\n\nso just he needs 3,000 coins today in order to retire.\n\nAnd, and you know what, let’s, let's say he can save….\n\nuhhh, psshhh, 10% of an average video producer’s salary in New York City.\n\nSomething completely random like that.\n\nAssuming Mario lives to the ripe old age of 90,\n\nwe can just plug these figures into the equation\n\nand figure out that Mario will be kickin' back on the white sands,\n\nboombox blastin' Jimmy Buffett at the youthful retirement age of...\n\n88?\n\nAre you fucking kidding me?\n\nNononono... That can’t be right…\n\nBecause if Mario can’t retire,\n\nthen that would mean that I wo-\n\n*uncomfortable silence*\n\nWill you excuse me for a moment…\n\n*tropical music playing in the background*\n\n*Another day in paradise!*\n\n*The sun is shining bright!*\n\n*People laugh and people smile, 'cause everything feels alright!*\n\nIn order to understand this a little better, I googled Mario hyperinfla- *laughing* I just,\n\nI'm sorry, I'm just accepting this now. I'm just accepting what I'm saying. ", ' The Mega Man robot masters were not always evil.\n\nIn fact, most were mechanized workers, created specifically to make life on Earth more efficient\n\nand wonderful.\n\nAND THEN THAT MASSIVE DONGER,\n\nDR. WILY, TURNED ‘EM ON US!\n\nSo Mega Man destroyed them, and the world was saved.\n\nBut... just how useful were these robots?\n\nAnd were they useful enough to chance a robot uprising?\n\nWhat if someone ranked every single Mega Man robot master from most to least useful to\n\nsee which ones were really worth the risk.\n\nSomeone should try to do that.\n\nIt’s me.\n\nI’m the one who’s going to do that.\n\nBefore I get started on the gradient of worth it to not worth it, I’m gonna talk\n\nabout the protagonists, or “the good guys” even though some of them aren’t specifically good.\n\nA lot of these robots were built to be sentient for the sake of being sentient, and I do not\n\nfeel at all qualified to discuss the philosophical implications of that.\n\nSo I’m gonna put ‘em over here.\n\nMega Man.\n\nMega Man X.\n\nMega Man red.\n\nThey’re all over here.\n\nI’m not gonna touch that.\n\nSo what kind of robots are good when they’re sentient?\n\nI think that it’s things humans cannot do.\n\nThings that perhaps only a robot could do.\n\nOne that can think for itself would be pretty worthwhile.\n\nSo let’s start with those ones.\n\nThe ones that are good.\n\nNumber one: Chill Man.\n\nChill Man is a recent robot master who was built to help stop global warming.\n\nAnd heaven knows we need that.\n\nDefinitely worthwhile.\n\nNext is another cold friend: Freeze Man.\n\nFreeze Man was built to make a non-polluting energy.\n\nHe would make that energy by splitting average temperatures\n\ninto hot temperatures and cold temperatures.\n\nI’m choosing to think of that as something like nuclear fission as opposed to choosing\n\nto think of it as dumb.\n\nCommando Man.\n\nTerrible name, but he was actually a minesweeping robot.\n\nOne of the first gens, Elec Man.\n\nHe controlled nuclear power plants.\n\nHe could help make sure the nuclear power plant was shut down in case anything bad ever\n\nhappened to one.\n\nHopefully it won’t!\n\nSsssssSTAR MAN!\n\nHe was built to explore the universe.\n\nHumans are real squishy, really, when you think about it.\n\nIt might be nice to have a man going out into the stars, a Star Man.\n\nAlso in his flavor text, he’s apparently a romantic and, like, loves poetry, and that’s\n\nwhat we need out in the stars.\n\nWhile he’s up there, Galaxy Man is helping figure out the trajectories.\n\nSplash Woman!\n\nShe’s super useful because she goes and helps shipwrecked sailors, or just people\n\nlost at sea.\n\nI feel like she’d do a better job than, I dunno, the Coast Guard or whatever.\n\nNot that I’m shitting on the Coast Guard.\n\nThey do do good…\n\nI’m digging myself in a hole.\n\nWait, where’d Toad Man go?\n\n*worry about Toad Man*\n\nWhere’s my guy Toad Man?\n\nToad Man.\n\nHe irrigates crops during drought.\n\nVery useful.\n\nWhy’d they make him a toad?\n\nIce Man.\n\nI swear we’ve got a lot of cold people up here at the front.\n\nHe’s built specifically to do human-like tasks in cold weather.\n\nSo he’s good!\n\nMore cold friends.\n\nBlizzard Man.\n\nThere to help monitor the weather in arctic environments.\n\nLooks and names can be deceiving, and Junk Man is super important.\n\nJunk Man was built so he could find useable robot parts that have been left out.\n\nThink about how much electronic waste we make.\n\nIt would be great if something could go dig through all of our trash and find the useable\n\ncircuit boards.\n\nThat’s important.\n\nHornet Man.\n\nWe’ve done some shit to bees y’all.\n\nHe pollinates the flowers.\n\nWould be very useful if we continue to keep doing shit to bees.\n\nAnd finally, we’ve got Cloud Man and Tornado Man.\n\nThey both are actually useful for, uh, controlling the weather when things are bad.\n\nI’m gonna put Cloud Man in front of Tornado Man because Tornado Man, uh, was, was built\n\nto stop tropical storms.\n\nWhich is not what a tornado is.\n\nHe needs a different name.\n\nThere we go.\n\nThese ones I would say are worth the risk.\n\nWe still have like 180 more to go.\n\nWe got a bunch of construction robots next.\n\nWe’ll start with everyone’s favorite: Guts Man.\n\nImagine there’s a line right here.\n\nMaybe I’ll put it in in after effects.\n\nThat might be too much work.\n\nI’m probably not gonna do that.\n\nGood ones.\n\nNow we’re into construction zone.\n\nGuts Man comes first because he’s a civil engineer.\n\nHe’s not only strong and can lift big rocks, but he can build bridges probably.\n\nWe’ve got Aqua Man and Pump Man.\n\nBoth of them are used for water filtration.\n\nI’m gonna put Aqua Man in front of Pump Man because Pump Man’s flavor text explains\n\nthat sometimes he’ll volunteer to wash off graffiti,\n\nand no one likes a narc.\n\nBomb Man: bombs.\n\nGround Man: excavation.\n\nBlock Man: makes blocks.\n\nConcrete Man: concrete.\n\nNeedle Man: needles.\n\nI guess it’s drilling.\n\nDrill Man: also drilling.\n\nBit Man, from the DOS game.\n\nHe is also a driller.\n\nYou think that after the first two went bad… they would’ve stopped making drill robots,\n\nright?\n\nOil Man DOS.\n\nHe does oil… things.\n\nHard Man.\n\n*trying to keep it together*\n\nHe doesn’t actually have a, um, flavor text explanation for what he is other than that\n\nhe is very heavy.\n\nSo I am assuming that he is for ground leveling.\n\nUm.\n\nBut maybe he’s just big?\n\nImpact Man: piling.\n\nCut Man: tree cutting.\n\nTorch Man DOS: welding.\n\nFuse Man: electrical equipment management.\n\nOil Man: keeping things oiled.\n\nSpark Man: making sparks!\n\nI think he actually charges things.\n\nFire Man.\n\nHe was made to incinerate trash.\n\nBond Man.\n\nHe was supposed to be in the first game until they realized… he was just glue.\n\nStone Man.\n\nI assume bricks, but actually they only say that he hangs out with Guts Man, so maybe\n\nhe’s just moral support.\n\nFlame Man.\n\nHe generates thermal power.\n\nBut also he’s powered by thermal power?\n\nWhich seems recursive.\n\nAnd also impossible.\n\nJewel Man.\n\nHe not only mines the jewels but he polishes them.\n\nFinally, in the construction, it’s Slash Man.\n\nHe was specifically made to cut down trees so that you could build SECRET bases.\n\nI don’t know why they insisted on saying it was for secret bases.\n\nThat seems like a waste of a robot.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I don’t think we needed to make these ones sentient, because\n\nyou know what, Hard Man?\n\nI think steamrollers were doing just fine.\n\nNow we’re getting into a category I like to call…\n\nSure???\n\nThey’re not necessarily bad.\n\nI just think we could probably do without Wind Man, who apparently helps with the harvest…\n\nwith fans.\n\nAstro Man, who just works in a planetarium.\n\nGravity Man.\n\nHe can control gravity which could be useful?\n\nDive Man.\n\nHe was built to catch fish with torpedoes.\n\nThey made him look like a submarine and they gave him torpedoes.\n\nFeel like they should’ve seen this coming.\n\nSolar Man.\n\nNow he investigates solar things, I guess.\n\nHe also apparently developed an exercise routine.\n\nI don’t know why they needed to put that in the flavor text, but it definitely put\n\nhim in the “Sure???” category.\n\nTop Man.\n\nI’ll give ya…\n\nI’ll give you a guess about what he does.\n\nDid you guess “explore other planets?”\n\nBecause yeah, that’s what he was designed for.\n\nWhy the FUCK is he a top?\n\nGod these are all so good.\n\nWe’re getting into the categories where I can’t stop laugh…\n\n*clears throat* *deep breath*\n\nSerious.\n\nSnake Man.\n\n*laughter from everyone in the studio*\n\nHe, uh, was supposed to explore other planets\n\nthat had crevasses.\n\nAnd he’s a snake.\n\nGyro Man.\n\nHe was supposed to be a really good plane, but then Wily ran out of money, so they just\n\nstuck a propellor on his back.\n\nPlant Man manages plants.\n\nPharaoh Man.\n\nOnly supposed to explore ruins.\n\nBlast Man.\n\nHe manages fireworks.\n\nFireworks are dangerous.\n\nDon’t play with fireworks.\n\nBut also, maybe, don’t make a robot to play with them.\n\nI love Nitro Man.\n\nI’m gonna be honest, I do feel kind of bad putting him into the “Sure???” category.\n\nUh, because Nitro Man was built specifically to do motorcycle stunts in movies.\n\nThe thing I really love about Nitro Man is that he’s the president of a stunt robot club.\n\nWhich I think is just wonderful.\n\nHe’s still not useful.\n\nHere’s where thing get a little bit difficult for me.\n\nBurst Man was built to be a guard.\n\nI’m not sure about robot, highly armed guards.\n\nBut since he was specifically a guard…\n\nI keep saying specifically.\n\nI figure, like, that’s still defensive, and so…\n\nI’ll put him here.\n\nBut it’s a good segue!\n\nIn the Mega Man games, not every robot was made by Dr. Wily or Dr. Light.\n\nAnd in fact, there were some robots that were made by other robots.\n\nOr were made extraterrestrially.\n\nOr were made specifically as a joke, like “I can’t find my keys, man!”\n\nI’m gonna put them kind of as the split in the middle to say, “Hey, these are nebulous,\n\nbut they’re definitely not good.”\n\nNow that we’ve got this hard line of good to bad, even though, to be honest, I think\n\nthat the line should be here.\n\nIt’s time for us to talk about the bad robots.\n\nJ.J. Abrams.\n\nSome of these robots were built specifically to murder.\n\nWe can all agree that that is bad.\n\nI’m gonna put all of these murder robots over on the very bad side.\n\nWe also have a bunch of characters that are Sonic robots.\n\nThat is an affront to nature.\n\nThey’re in the bad side, too.\n\nI also didn’t even print out all of the NetNavis from Mega Man Battle Network even\n\nthough I love those games because those were software built with the specific intention\n\nof being mean online.\n\nAnd that’s just Twitter.\n\nI do just want to point out Aircon Man, who was a robot sent from the future to destroy\n\nthe world.\n\nAnd he’s also an air conditioning unit.\n\nNow *kick* let’s get into the fun part.\n\nThese robots have absolutely no reason to be sentient.\n\nChemistry Man.\n\nHe’s from the new cartoon.\n\nHe apparently taught chemistry classes that were so boring, he put kids to sleep.\n\nAnd then he took it really personally, and decided to become evil.\n\nSheep Man.\n\nHe’s a shepard actually.\n\nTundra Man.\n\nBuilt to do similar things to all of the high echelon frozen people, but I’m including\n\nhim over here because he got really bored at his job and then decided to become\n\nan ice skater.\n\nThis is why you don’t make sentient robots, I guess.\n\nHypno Woman.\n\nShe was a therapist who hypnotized people into bad things.\n\nDJ Jazzy J4-8950…\n\nis a boombox.\n\nYou are a magnet.\n\nPlug Man charged electrical things.\n\nLike a plug could do.\n\nStrike Man sounds cool, but he’s just a baseball throwing machine.\n\nIt’s me.\n\nSpring Man can… jump?\n\nBright Man.\n\nBuilt to explore dark places.\n\nKinda like a FLASHLIGHT.\n\nCold Man’s a refrigerator.\n\nSeriously.\n\nSword Man.\n\nHe was developed to hold a sword that Wily stole from a place.\n\nHe’s not a sentient murder robot.\n\nHe’s a sentient picture frame.\n\nThings that don’t really need to be sentient?\n\nA vacuum.\n\nIt’s Dust Man.\n\nAlthough, Dust Man is quoted as saying, “Don’t let me suck more than I can handle!”\n\nSo you know what, actually, I take this back.\n\nHe’s more important than Chill Man.\n\nWe’ve already done the worthwhile ones.\n\nWe’ve talked about the construction ones.\n\nWe’ve talked about the ones that are “eh whaat uh sure w-okay thas fine.”\n\nWe have all of the ones that are alien.\n\nAnd we’ve got the ones that really didn’t need to be sentient.\n\nWe are left with the dregs of robotic society.\n\nI call this category…\n\nNO.\n\nWe’ll start with Crystal Man.\n\nHe was built to make crystals so that Dr. Wily could sell them for money.\n\nTurbo Man is a car.\n\nOr rather, he used to be a car, but then he was turned into turbo man.\n\nCharge Man.\n\nIs he a train?\n\nNo.\n\nBut he’s meant to camouflage as one.\n\nI think Dr. Wily’s just real into trains.\n\nYou know what I think about when I think of “Safety Operations Manager?”\n\nA big man full of magma.\n\nBuilt to make sure a plant kept safe, but also had a bunch of cauldrons full of boiling\n\nmagma in him.\n\nTime Man.\n\nHe’s a time machine.\n\nThat never goes well.\n\nAcid Man was built to be a chemist.\n\nWhat’s he good for, titrations?\n\nThat\'s a chemistry joke.\n\nCentaur Man.\n\nHe... was a tour guide.\n\nJust hire a 16 year old.\n\nLike, they need the job.\n\nShark Man DOS.\n\nShark Man DOS not need to exist.\n\nOh we’ve been doing this for like five hours.\n\n*CLAP CLAP*\n\nGoddamnit.\n\nMagic Man was built to be a magician in like a traveling circus sort of show.\n\nAnd then he was not turned evil, he just decided to conscript in King’s army because he wanted\n\nto show off.\n\nHere’s the big rule of thumb:\n\nmagicians are always evil.\n\nShade Man.\n\nHe looks like a vampire, doesn’t he?\n\nIt’s ‘cause he was built to look like one.\n\nHe was an animatronic robot in a haunted house.\n\nSomebody thought we should make that creepy animatronic robot sentient.\n\nPHEW remember how Centaur Man was a tour guide?\n\nWell so was Dynamo Man.\n\nBut they also made him constantly shoot off electricity.\n\nThat’s a bad tour guide.\n\nWhen they got into, like, the late game stages, they were just like, “I dunno, he’s a\n\ntour guide for a thing.”\n\nTorch Man was built to teach kids about fire safety in the woods.\n\nWhich is kind of like if Smokey the Bear\n\nwas CONSTANTLY ON FIRE.\n\nYou thought torch man was bad, let me tell ya about Burner Man, who was made, and I quote,\n\n“to bring harm to natural environments.”\n\nTechnically not murder.\n\nDefinitely bad.\n\nRemember how I said that a lot of these guys were tour guides?\n\nWell let me tell you about Blade Man.\n\nBuilt to show off an old castle full of swords.\n\nAnd also was a sword.\n\nTengu Man.\n\nMakes typhoons.\n\nHOOOKAY.\n\nWe’re at the final three here.\n\nWe’ve made it.\n\nAnd I’d say that these three really hammer home the point\n\nthat we should not be making sentient robots.\n\nWe’ve got Pirate Man.\n\nNot a murder robot.\n\nBut was built to do pirate things, like steal from other ships.\n\nHe does look cool as hell, though.\n\nThe second to last robot is not actually a terrible robot idea.\n\nBut it is a testament to just how trash human beings are.\n\nBounce Man was built to be a crash test dummy.\n\nSome asshole thought, “Hey, you know that thing we throw against a wall,\n\nmany miles-per-hour,\n\nevery single day,\n\nmultiple times a day?\n\nYou know what would make that better?\n\nIF IT COULD FEEL PAIN.”\n\nWHAT?\n\nLuckily, Bounce Man bounced from that job and then became an exercise instructor.\n\nHumans are trash.\n\nFinally, we’ve come to number one.\n\nClown Man.\n\nWho has ever watched a clown and thought to themselves,\n\n“Boy,\n\nI wish that thing never got tired!"\n\nClown Man is terrible, and I’m not saying that clowns are terrible.\n\nOkay?\n\nClowns serve their purpose.\n\nThey’re creepy.\n\nSometimes good.\n\nAnd…\n\nYou know what, I do take that back, clowns don’t serve a purpose.\n\nThat’s it.\n\nAll 200+ Mega Man robot masters, of which 15 are kind of okay.\n\nElon Musk: don’t get any ideas.\n\nThis is what man has wrought.\n\nYou will see these men in your nightmares.\n\nParticularly,\n\nSpring Man.\n\nJumping around.\n\nMake sure to like this video and subscribe to Polygon.\n\nAnd maybe leave a comment about what I should take care of next.\n\nBecause this… was bad. ', " Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.\n\nA game that takes heroic and villainous characters and forces them to form fraternal bonds in\n\nthe crucible of battle.\n\nBecause for those who can superbly smash, there is no better place to make a friend\n\nthan on the battlefield.\n\nThat’s the battlefield?\n\nSeriously?\n\nHow did they get permits for that?\n\nThat’s irresponsible.\n\nHi, I’m Brian David Gilbert, safety fan and bureaucratic wunderkind, please address\n\nme as such, and I’ve spent the last week and a half poring over the regulations of\n\nthe United States Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration,\n\nalso known as OSHA.\n\nI’m here to hold Super Smash Bros. to account.\n\nBecause when you take 70-plus beloved characters and force them to fight for our entertainment,\n\nthe least you can do is make sure the buildings are up to code.\n\nSo let's go ahead and FIND EVERY OSHA VIOLATION IN EVERY STAGE IN SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE.\n\nFirst, let’s explain the process, we have to start by choosing the correct regulations,\n\nand unfortunately, there isn’t a OSHA guide to “bloodsport,” so we're just gonna go\n\nwith construction, form 1926. 'Cause that's close enough.\n\nThe main thing to point out here is 1926.10 subsection A. I’ll read an excerpt for you\n\nso you can understand the basic concept of this video, and also the hellscape I had to slog through\n\nthe past week: “no contractor or subcontractor contracting for any part of the contract work”\n\n— that’s a real line — “shall require any laborer or mechanic employed in the performance\n\nof the contract to work in surroundings or under working conditions which are unsanitary,\n\nhazardous, or dangerous.”\n\nBasically, we’re here to build a safer experience for these characters, because when you walk\n\ninto an unknown space, I want the first question on your mind to be:\n\nThere are roughly 350 regulations in form 1926.\n\nHow many pages is that?\n\nAbout 684.\n\nDon’t worry, this is... this is just a visual aid.\n\nThey're all blank.\n\nI wouldn't waste paper like that.\n\n*thinks of the times he's wasted paper*\n\nMost of these regulations are irrelevant, but I\n\nstill had to read all 684 pages in order to know which ones to cut.\n\nWhich reminds me, this video idea came from commenter nshady16, so if you have an Unraveled\n\nidea, why don't you go ahead and leave me a comment.\n\nAnd thanks, nshady16, for making me read 684 pages of OSHA regulations,\n\nyou piece of garbage.\n\nSo I cut out all of the regulations that were just definitions, unrelated to stages, nonmandatory,\n\nredundant, or about personnel safety, because again, we’re not talking about hard hats,\n\nwe're talking about the stages themselves.\n\nUnfortunately, this also meant I had to cut out the entirety of subsection R.\n\nSteel Erection.\n\nSo there goes like 80% of the jokes in this video.\n\nOut of those 350 regulations, we’re left with 46 that actually relate to Smash Bros. stages.\n\nAnd again, we're just using the 103 stages you get when you boot up Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.\n\nAny any secret stages that pop up later, uh, that's probably just an underground fighting\n\nring, which is a different form of illegality.\n\nI’m gonna explain all of these OSHA violations as we go along.\n\nBut I just want you to keep in mind that there is a maximum penalty of $12,934 per OSHA violation.\n\nWe’ll get into that later.\n\nLet's get these OSHA violations on the board.\n\nBAM!\n\nThat's all the OSHA regulations we'll be discussing today.\n\nLet's start with the codes that pretty much every stage violates.\n\nGeneral safety and health provisions.\n\nI threw these three here because they're just dangerous in general and they don't have that\n\nmany other specific violations.\n\nSafety training and education.\n\nSeems like most of these people don't have safety training.\n\nEspecially in Moray Towers, where they literally shoot guns at you as you fly into the stage.\n\nRecording and reporting of injuries.\n\nWii Fit Studio is a gym, and so I would expect it to have paperwork if one of the gym members\n\ngets injured.\n\nUnfortunately, all of the gym members get injured.\n\nMeans of egress.\n\nIn most places, you have to have exit signs.\n\nAnd also, you have to have exits that don't involve plummeting to your death.\n\nEmployee emergency action plans.\n\nIt's very important to have an emergency action plan.\n\nEspecially if that emergency action plan is for if a mountaintop breaks off and slides\n\ninto the ocean.\n\nLook at this polar bear!\n\nHe has no fuckin' clue what's going on!\n\nAccident prevention, signs, and tags.\n\nJust put one wet floor sign anywhere, and I'll let it slide, okay?\n\nDuty to have fall protection.\n\nI mean uh... there's no fall protection.\n\nHow hard is it to put a harness on someone?\n\nGeneral requirements for stairways and ladders.\n\nAnything above 19 inches of elevation needs a staircase or a ladder.\n\nNot everyone can double jump.\n\nSanitation.\n\nMost of sanitation deals with potable versus non-potable water.\n\nBut a lot of it also deals with toilets, and I have yet to find a Smash Bros. stage that\n\nincludes a restroom.\n\nAnd I need to know where Donkey Kong pees.\n\nSo those ones pretty much everyone gets wrong.\n\nWhich means that we're at about 900 violations already.\n\nYikes!\n\nI feel a bit bad hitting all of these stages so hard, so I'll be a bit lenient for 1926.50.\n\nMedical services and first aid.\n\nYou have to provide first aid if someone has been hurt.\n\nAnd I'll just let the max tomato fulfill that requirement.\n\n451 states that you can't be using unstable objects as scaff.\n\nI'm gonna call all of these scaff 'cause there's no OSHA guideline for levitating floors.\n\nJumping on an awning causes it to break in Onett.\n\nThat's totally irresponsible.\n\n452 states that you need to have cross bracing.\n\nKongo Falls has so many things that aren't cross braced.\n\n453 is all about aerial lifts.\n\nYou need to stand firmly on the ground while it is moving.\n\nStop jumping!\n\nHousekeeping.\n\nYou gotta clean out the debris.\n\nI don't care that you've got a big dog running around behind you... put the... put the blocks\n\naway, that's debris!\n\nPut your toys away, honey!\n\nOccupational noise exposure.\n\nI'm ignoring the fact that they're fighting on top of a jet and instead thinking about\n\nhow loud those jets are.\n\nPop some earplugs in!\n\nGases, vapors, fumes, dusts, and mists.\n\nAll of these stages have clouds that you can stand on.\n\nWhich means they're incredibly dense.\n\nI don't care what it's made of, you shouldn't be breathing that in.\n\nIllumination.\n\nThose torches don't do anything.\n\nI'm gonna trip and stub my toe.\n\nVentilation.\n\nA lot of these stages need more airflow, better ventilation, but in Pictochat 2, there is\n\ntoo much ventilation in the form of this man who blows air.\n\nWho hired this man?\n\nI don't want him on my job site.\n\nHazardous waste operations and emergency response.\n\nIn Flat Zone X, someone spills oil and then just leaves it there.\n\n1926.150, 151, 152, and 154 are all about fire protection.\n\nMost of these regulations are pretty self explanatory.\n\nYou need to have a fire extinguisher.\n\nIt needs to be readily available.\n\nYou can't have ignition hazards hanging around.\n\nYou can't store more than 25 gallons of a flammable liquid in one place.\n\nBy the way, I'm including magma as a flammable liquid.\n\nI know they mean petroleum substances, but I think that's just a lack of imagination\n\non OSHA's part.\n\nBut 154 is all about temporary heating devices and how they shouldn't be kept in enclosed spaces.\n\nKind of like the charmander at the top of Saffron City.\n\nThe general requirements of electrical equipment.\n\nThey should be kept free from hazards that could cause death or harm to employees.\n\nThe large airships flying around you in these stages are not only electrical equipment,\n\nbut they are designed to harm and kill you.\n\nViolation.\n\nSpecific purpose equipment and installations.\n\nThis is all about elevators and escalators.\n\nWarioWare Inc. is one big elevator.\n\nYou don't need me to tell you it's broken.\n\nHelicopters.\n\nIs a Shy Guy a helicopter?\n\nI think so.\n\nYou're not supposed to be working underneath hovering craft.\n\nEven if they're bringing you fruit.\n\nConveyors.\n\nThat includes the stages that move back and forth and also all of the scrolling stages,\n\nwhich are the fastest way to die in Super Smash Bros. Tools and material shall be secured\n\nto prevent movement.\n\nDon't move equipment unless it's safe.\n\nThey're on a live racetrack.\n\nAll of the things are moving.\n\nMarine operations and equipment.\n\nYou have to have a lifering on a barge, and you have to provide a walkway between wharfs\n\nand boats.\n\nPaper Mario dissolves into a boat, but that doesn't count as a walkway.\n\nAnd there is not a single lifering at the Donkey Kong residence.\n\nI don't care how good you are at surfing, FUNKY KONG.\n\nUnderground construction.\n\nIf you're working underground, you're required to have a five-person rescue team on call.\n\nAnd although Super Smash Bros.\n\nUltimate does allow up to eight players.\n\nNone of them will save you.\n\nWorking on or near exposed energized parts.\n\nDoes a pokemon count as an energized circuit?\n\nAccording to OSHA, yes.\n\n1926.1052 is all about stairways.\n\nIf you have a stairway that rises more than 40 inches, you need to have a handrail.\n\nI imagine that Mario is about 40 inches tall, and this is at least four or five times his height.\n\nViolation.\n\nViolation.\n\nVIOLATION.\n\nVIOLATION!\n\nConfined spaces.\n\nThese are places where you are building where it's hard to get in and out of.\n\nYou need to specify the acceptable entry conditions.\n\nThere are no acceptable entry conditions into a space with a pit full of acid.\n\nDisposal of waste materials.\n\nIf you are dropping waste materials more than 25 feet, you need to be putting it in a chute.\n\nClock Tower: it is all debris that is falling infinitely.\n\nAnd it SHOULD be in a chute.\n\n850 is about preparing the demolition building.\n\nYou're supposed to remove any glass that could break.\n\nAnd in Dracula's Castle, Death flies through the window and breaks the glass.\n\nI couldn't give a shit about Death, you should've removed that stained glass first.\n\n853, you can't have a aggregate of more than 25% of a floor destroyed, and in Find Mii,\n\nhe destroys half of the stage.\n\nThe manual removal of floors.\n\nYou can destroy a lot of things in Shadow Moses Island, but you shouldn't be standing\n\nunder them.\n\nTower cranes.\n\nThere is only one stage that violates this.\n\nIt's literally the only stage with a tower crane, and ya FUCKED IT UP!\n\nExplosives should be stored in a magazine when they're not in use.\n\nAnd in Wrecking Crew, they're just available for you to punch until they explode.\n\nFiring the blast.\n\nYou shouldn't be in the proximity of the blast.\n\nNor should you be in the barrel that is causing the blast and shooting you off into space.\n\n1926.53 and 54 are about different types of radiation.\n\nIonizing, which is nuclear, and non-ionizing, which is like lasers.\n\nFinal Destination is just flying around through random parts of space.\n\nThere is no protection.\n\nYou should be less worried about getting punched into oblivion and more worried about the cancers.\n\nIn Gamer, your mom fires lasers at you when she sees you gaming.\n\nI'm not here to discuss her qualifications, but you are not allowed to fire those lasers\n\nat employees.\n\nJUST LET ME GAME, MOM!\n\nLadders.\n\nSuzaku Castle?\n\nYou thought you could get away with that shitty-ass ladder?\n\nThose ladder rungs need to be uniform.\n\nThey need to be evenly spaced.\n\nThey need to not be broken.\n\nI know that ladder is there for aesthetic purposes, but THAT IS A VIOLATION, SUZAKU\n\nCASTLE.\n\nYOU CANNOT HIDE YOUR LADDERS FROM ME.\n\nThat leaves us with one stage.\n\nThe one that has violated the most regulations.\n\nBut I want to point out Boxing Ring.\n\nThe only stage that is OSHA compliant.\n\nIt's almost as if it was built to allow people to fight in it safely.\n\nSakurai, I know you worked so hard on this game, and I appreciate it so much, but you\n\ncould have stopped at just one stage.\n\nYou SHOULD have STOPPED at JUST ONE STAGE.\n\nFinally, weighing in at 23 OSHA violations, it's 75m.\n\nI'm not 100% sure if this had so many violations just because it is a construction site, so\n\nit was easier for me to find all of the flaws with it.\n\nObviously, Brinstar is probably more dangerous, but I don't know how to categorize Mother Brain.\n\nThe thing that pushed it over the edge was material hoists, personnel hoists, and elevators.\n\nThey need to be enclosed at all times.\n\nPeople can just jump on and off of these material hoists over there.\n\nThat's so irresponsible.\n\nThere's fire.\n\nThere are jacks that get thrown across the stage.\n\nThere is a large ape.\n\nAgain, I could not categorize that, but I know he shouldn't of been there! 75m is the\n\nmost OSHA violating stage in Smash Bros.\n\nAnd if you have to get rid of one of them, that's the one you should get rid of first,\n\nand then you should get rid of the rest of them, too.\n\nBecause, again, OSHA does not stop after one stage.\n\nLet's remember back to the beginning of this video when I talked about violation penalties.\n\nI mentioned that every serious violation of OSHA is $12,934 in fines.\n\nI forgot to mention that every repeated or willful violation is $129,336 per violation.\n\nI am going to pretend that I found all of these violations on the same day, and that\n\nthey didn't have a chance to fix them all, so therefore they are not repeated.\n\nBut that's still 1,317 violations.\n\nOr $17,034,078 in fines.\n\nWhich is why I am sending you this video, Masahiro Sakurai.\n\nSurely you can't afford 17 million dollars in fines.\n\nI'm willing to let bygones be bygones.\n\nOSHA doesn't need to hear about all of this evidence I've compiled.\n\nAll you must do is send me 50 US dollars.\n\nI'm in a real tough situation right now and I just need to get through the month.\n\nPlease.\n\nAlso you could send me Kirby's phone number.\n\nI know he is real.\n\nWhere are you hiding him?\n\nAnd I have yet to see a Super Smash Bros. stage that includes a toilet.\n\nAnd I need to see where Donkey Kong pees.\n\n*Pat & Brian laughing* And I need to know where Donkey Kong Pees.\n\nOh god I was so close!\n\nAnd I need to know where Donkey Kong peeHHSHSS.\n\n*through laughter* sorry this is... *breathe in* AHHHH ", " *cheerful music, slowly diminishing*\n\nIs life quantifiable?\n\nEvery breath, every beat of a heart...\n\nDo they count as tallies etched tirelessly into the stone of our existence,\n\nuntil one day, that stone is returned to dust?\n\nIs there a number, an algorithm, underlying the spark of life?\n\nAnd if given the chance to know the arcane secrets of that algorithm,\n\nwould you use that power for good?\n\nOr would you use it to calculate your pet’s HP?\n\nBecause that’s what I would do!\n\n*energetic music*\n\nHIT POINTS!\n\nWhat are they and how did they become the standard unit of life in nearly every game?\n\nIt all started with war games, tabletop games that involve a lot of little miniature military\n\nforces fighting on a battlefield.\n\nBack in the 1920s, the Naval War College created an early form of this in order to help evaluate\n\nbattles before actually fighting them.\n\nThey had a stat called “Life” which was determined by how many\n\n14-inch shell hits a vessel could take.\n\nSo that’s what a hit point is, how many 14-inch shells it would take to kill you.\n\nEvery living creature is one hit point.\n\nThe end.\n\nBut that isn’t our current understanding of HP.\n\nThat came when war games shrank in scope and started to become more fantasy oriented.\n\nIn older games, you would roll dice, and then your troops would either survive or they would die.\n\nYou had large swaths of nameless troops so you could do this without feeling any remorse\n\nover their deaths.\n\nHaha.\n\nWar.\n\nBut when these games stopped playing with hundreds of troops and instead focused on\n\na few main characters, players realized they didn’t want their characters to die!\n\nSo the hit point was born.\n\nYour character could survive X number of bad rolls before throwing them in the garbage.\n\nSo really, the hit point wasn’t made to quantify how easy something is to kill,\n\nit was born from compassion and wanting to see your characters grow and thrive.\n\nAnd then also to figure out how easy they were to kill.\n\nWe’ve had some semblance of HP for nearly a century, but we haven’t updated our real-world\n\nunderstanding of what one hit point looks like.\n\nSo I’ll be doing that, specifically so you can quantify your pet’s HP.\n\nA little disclaimer up front:\n\nI am not giving you this algorithm so you can battle your pets.\n\nAnimal abuse is wrong.\n\nAnd if you needed me to tell you that...\n\nI’m glad I told you that.\n\nI'm also not teaching you how to calculate human HP, because that power is too great to wield,\n\nand it could easily be used for evil by some of the most wicked forces on Earth...\n\nlike health insurance companies.\n\nNo, I am teaching you how to calculate your pet’s HP as a fun bonding exercise between\n\nyou and your animal, or in case you happen to be at a house party where you don’t know\n\nanyone but the hosts have a dog and so instead of just sitting in the corner pretending to\n\ntext people, you can spend your time calculating that dog's HP, which is a way more normal\n\nthing to do in a social situation.\n\nNow it is time for the research.\n\nHow are we going to effectively calculate ANY pet’s HP?\n\nLuckily, there are plenty of games that cover pretty much every type of pet that you could\n\npossibly have, but I’ll be using Pokemon as the main pet HP analog because it is literally\n\nabout having lots and lots of pets that you can love and cherish\n\nand I’m ignoring all the other stuff.\n\nAnd that brings us to our first criteria: Type.\n\nAccording to the National Pet Owners Survey, here are the most common types of pets found\n\nin U.S. Households.\n\nI appreciate that they have included a category called “Small Animals,”\n\nas if that means fucking anything.\n\nSo we're changing some things.\n\nThe standards are still there: Dog, Cat, Fish (and all aquatic creatures), Reptile, Bird,\n\nEquine, Small animal is becoming small mammal for things like ferrets and rabbits.\n\nWe're also including bug, because I love bugs!\n\nAnd if you have bugs in your house and you make the conscious decision to WANT those bugs in your house,\n\nthey aren't pests,\n\nthey're pets...s.\n\nAmphibian for the frog people.\n\nFarm animals covers any livestock that don’t immediately fit into the other categories.\n\nOriginally, I thought about classifying these quadrupedal animals as different sorts of dog.\n\nChunky dog, milky dog, horny dog.\n\nBut farm animal encompasses them a little bit better.\n\nI am still keeping those names, though.\n\nWe also have a category I call “exotic,” which encompasses all of the animals you see\n\nin instagram influencer pics that make you say,\n\nThis can go from monkeys to bats to hyenas, which, according to this incredibly reliable\n\nwebsite, I could technically own in New York due to a loophole?\n\n*about to make a terrible decision*\n\nAlso, Millennials and Gen Z often live in tiny, “no pet” apartments and\n\ndon’t get paid enough to support a decent standard of living for themselves, let alone\n\na pet, so they’ll often turn to plants in order to feel the joy that comes from nurturing\n\na living thing in our rapidly decaying ecosystem.\n\n*sigh*\n\nSo I’m extending pet status to plants so that way you too can do this HP calculation,\n\nbecause, god, we all need a distraction sometimes.\n\nBy building a set of pet types, we are able to assign HP RANGES to each of them by finding\n\nthe lowest base HP and highest max HP of each type.\n\nThe absolute extremes of this scale are Shedinja, with a base HP of 1, and Wailord, with a max HP of 544.\n\nNow, both of these would be pretty wild to have as pets,\n\nconsidering one is the shell left behind after a cicada molts,\n\nand the other is a fucking whale.\n\nBut that’s why they’re the extremes, and that’s why we are not done with our equation yet.\n\nWe might know the full HP range of a dog, but what is the HP range of YOUR dog.\n\nI thought for a moment about having size be the next criteria, because you might think\n\nthat the larger the animal, the more HP it would have.\n\nBut that’s actually not true!\n\nIn fact, the Pokemon with the highest base HP is Blissey, this strange little egg woman.\n\nAnd Onix, an enormous rock snake, has one of the lowest base HPs of all Pokemon.\n\nThis confused me, so I had to go back to the original popularizer of HP: Dungeons & Dragons.\n\nAnd it was there that I realized what truly affects your HP value:\n\nYour value is not defined by the size or shape of your body,\n\nit’s about what you do with the body you’re given.\n\n*cheesy motivational music*\n\nIt’s all about class!\n\nAs in, what standard gaming class does your pet fall into?\n\nEvery class has different HP ranges based on what they are expected to do.\n\nBarbarians are out in the front lines, so they tend to have a lot more HP than a rogue,\n\nwho is slinking around in the back.\n\nI’ve decided that the classes that make the most sense for pets are: Barbarian, Ranger,\n\nPaladin, Cleric, and Rogue.\n\nI haven’t included any classes like sorcerer, because if you have a magical pet,\n\nwhat are you doing here?\n\nGo cast spells with your turtle.\n\nThese class distinctions separate your pet’s HP range into 10 equal portions.\n\nIf your pet is a rogue, you get the first six.\n\nIf your pet is a barbarian, you're anywhere from five to 10.\n\nYour pet’s personality will determine what class they fall into.\n\nYour pet is a rogue if they are rakish, mischievous, and spry.\n\nCats tend to come to mind for the rogue category, simply because they’re always up in shit\n\nthey should not be up in.\n\nYour pet is a cleric if they are kind, reserved, and healing.\n\nA rabbit that hops onto your lap after a rough day of work and makes you forget all your\n\nworries is 100% cleric.\n\nYour pet is a paladin if it is loyal, resourceful, and, honestly, tries a little bit too hard.\n\nDoes your zucchini plant produce too many zucchinis?\n\nA.K.A.\n\nAny amount of zucchinis?\n\nIt's a paladin.\n\nYour pet is a ranger if they are self-sufficient, aloof, and kind of do their own thing.\n\nAsk yourself, am I holding my pet rat back from their true ambitions?\n\nThe answer is always yes, and your rat is a ranger.\n\nAnd finally your pet is a barbarian if they are boorish, brazen, and courageous to a fault.\n\nDoes your dog dig under the fence so it can jump into your neighbor’s pool?\n\nYour dog is Marmaduke.\n\nIt is also a Barbarian.\n\nYour pet can have a combination of many of these traits, but it’s up to you to decide\n\nwhich traits are most dominant.\n\nNow that we have your pet’s type and class designated, we need to get into the nitty\n\ngritty of their exact HP, which means finding your pet's level.\n\nIn order to do this, you must observe your pet in a scientific manner.\n\nSo I reached out to field biologist.\n\nHi, I’m Olivia.\n\nI'm a wildlife biologist.\n\nI contacted Olivia after she responded to my totally normal twitter request with this\n\ndope-ass picture.\n\nI figured that if anyone knew how to calculate the hit points of an animal, it would be someone\n\nholding a huge bird like it was a torch.\n\nHave you ever found the hit points of any of the animals you've been researching?\n\nI've never been involved in any sort of study where that was something that we looked at.\n\nSo no.\n\nOkay.\n\nBut there are probably plenty of studies about hit points with animals.\n\nProbably.\n\nThough she didn’t have experience with my specific question, I knew she would have some\n\nuseful advice for observing animals in their natural habitat.\n\nWhen you're observing an animal, how much interaction should you have with it?\n\nNone.\n\nNone.\n\nAt all.\n\nNone.\n\nYou have to sit in like a blind or a tent of some sort where you're hidden or you look\n\nlike part of the environment.\n\nYou could wear a ghillie suit.\n\nBrian - Oh!\n\nOlivia - People have also done that.\n\nHow long of a period are you observing that animal for?\n\nIt depends on how much time and resources you have, obviously.\n\nThere have been scientists that have been observing the same hawk for, like, 20 years in a row.\n\nSo if I'm trying to... perfectly know my pet's HP, I should be observing it for\n\nmultiple years.\n\nYes.\n\nCool.\n\nHow do you take notes when you're observing an animal.\n\nRight, so, I actually—can I send you something?\n\nYes, please.\n\nThis is exactly what I was looking for.\n\nOlivia had sent me an animal behavior data sheet, which I could use as a template for\n\nobserving and recording a pet’s behavior.\n\nBut some of these behaviors wouldn’t make sense when observing your pet on a random day.\n\nWe ended up developing a new sheet that had standard behaviors and class specific behaviors\n\nthat had different weights associated with them.\n\nYou observe your pet for X number of hours, tally up all the behaviors they did over the\n\ncourse of those hours, and then divide the weighted total by X to give you your pet’s level.\n\nThe logic behind this is that a higher level pet is more likely to do more intense and\n\nclass specific behaviors.\n\nThen you plug that level into this algorithm, and you get your pet’s HP.\n\nIt may seem challenging, but science shouldn’t be easy, it should be correct.\n\nThis is probably the hardest scientific work you've ever had to do.\n\nIt really is.\n\nYeah.\n\nWith these tips in mind, I welcome you into my home.\n\nIn order to test these calculations, I need a test subject.\n\nSo I’m using my roommate’s cat, Zuko!\n\nHe lives in my apartment but he doesn’t pay rent and he eats my bagels if I leave\n\nthem unattended.\n\nAs I mentioned previously, finding your pet's HP can be a fun bonding exercise, and in this\n\ncase, I’ve been dealing with this small bastard’s antics for so long, I need to\n\nremind myself why he’s here by quantifying his value.\n\nThe first step is easy!\n\nHe is a cat.\n\nThat puts him in the cat category.\n\nOkay.\n\nStep two, we gotta give Zuko a class.\n\nAs I mentioned previously, cats are often rogues, but I don't think that fits Zuko considering\n\nhe’s the least stealthy creature I know.\n\nHis meow sounds like he’s been smoking two packs a day for the past forty years.\n\n*incredibly raspy meow*\n\nAnd every time he does manage to sneak into his food cabinet,\n\nhe lets me know immediately.\n\nJust wanted to check in on what's going on up here in the cat cabinet where we keep all\n\nof the food for the cat.\n\n*loud crash*\n\nHe is loud, stubborn, and not afraid to make terrible decisions in plain\n\nview of me.\n\nAnd that makes this guy a Barbarian.\n\nOkay!\n\nBut now it is time to observe Zuko to find his level.\n\nAs per Olivia’s instructions, I must observe him for several years without any interaction.\n\nAfter explaining why I needed it, my time off request was denied.\n\nSo instead, I ate some bodega sushi in order to induce illness, and I took a sick day.\n\nMmmm.\n\nThis is the hard part, because it's going to require me to observe Zuko as he goes about\n\nhis daily business without him noticing that I am here at all.\n\nI assumed my position, and I waited for the interesting behaviors to start.\n\n*cheeky music plays*\n\nNot only was this terribly boring, but I was beginning to fear that Zuko\n\nwas not as strong as I had hoped.\n\nDO SOMETHING!\n\nPLEASE!\n\nBut then I realized there was a exploit in my system.\n\nThough Olivia, a scientist, said that you should keep your interferences to a minimum...\n\nI’m not a scientist, I’m a gamer.\n\nAnd I began what is known as power leveling.\n\nI had to get Zuko as many experience points as I could before my roommate got home and\n\nasked me what I was doing.\n\nOver the course of the day, Zuko averaged 63 behavioral experience points per hour,\n\nalthough those behaviors were somewhat coerced by me.\n\nI know that I broke my system by interacting with Zuko, but if it makes my pet happier\n\nand it makes him less of a weak-ass scrub, why wouldn’t I game the system!\n\nI had also noticed that Zuko and I had grown closer, our support level had increased to\n\nat least a B. I no longer saw him as a freeloader who sometimes throws up in my bed,\n\nI saw him as a companion...\n\nwho sometimes throws up in my bed.\n\nWhen I felt lonely in my empty apartment, he was there for me.\n\nWhen my stomach ached from the bodega sushi, he purred at just the right frequency to ease my pain.\n\nWhen I was worried he was going to be under leveled, he soothed my anxieties\n\nwith his heavenly voice.\n\n*beautiful meow*\n\nAnd all this time I had spent trying to calculate his HP,\n\nI hadn't realized he was replenishing mine.\n\nSo here is Zuko, Barbarian class level 63.\n\nI love him with all my heart, and he loves me just the same.\n\nOw!\n\nOkay, okay...\n\n*lots of wonderful meows*\n\nBeautiful.\n\nPsst!\n\nRemember when I said I really wanted to play the Cyberpunk RPG?\n\nWe finally did it.\n\nCome watch me play as a totally uncool forum moderator called Vang0Bang0.\n\nGuys don't say other things, we should only have one person in the...\n\nYou're making it sound like there are more than one person in...\n\nThere's only one person in the bathroom! ", ' *drum beat*\n\nTHE SIMS! While other games push you through the meticulously crafted story\n\nof some hero, this game allows you to experience the joy that comes from crafting your friends and family\n\nand then making them pee themselves in doorless rooms.\n\nI’ve been playing The Sims since I was a kid, and it allowed me to imagine what I might become.\n\nA successful doctor, perhaps, with a mansion\n\nand a pool that doesn’t have a ladder to get out of it.\n\nAnd now that I’m a D-list internet video producer with a grungy apartment in New York City,\n\nI’ve realized that I was using The Sims as wish fulfillment.\n\nPerhaps there’s a better way.\n\nI might only have one life, but my Sim can live many, many lives.\n\nI was playing a game.\n\nI should have been doing an experiment.\n\nSo today, I’m going to use The Sims to perfect my living situation.\n\n*music stops*\n\nOh what a surprise!\n\nNow, this Unraveled will be a little bit different\n\nconsidering most of it is going to be game footage, meaning...\n\nI don’t need any paper!\n\nLet me explain my methodology. We will have two subjects:\n\nSimulated Brian, and reality Brian, which is me, I’m Reality Brian.\n\nHere’s my hypothesis: If Simulated Brian’s living situation can be perfected in the Sims,\n\nthen Reality Brian’s living situation can also be perfected by altering it the same way in real life.\n\nNow, I could try to do this in a “perfectly controlled environment,” but life is messy and sometimes\n\nscience has to be messy, too. So before I can create my Sim...\n\nI gotta measure my apartment.\n\nObviously, I have to work with what I currently have. And if I’m supposed to make an honest\n\nsimulacrum of my living situation I gotta make sure it’s to scale.\n\nI should also point out that I live in a three bedroom apartment with two roommates and a cat. And although\n\nthey have rooms of their own, I will not be modeling them in the Sims.\n\nPartially because I rarely spend any time in their rooms, but it’s more because I am a good roommate\n\nwho respects personal boundaries. I will not redecorate their personal spaces.\n\nBut I will exploit the common space for content.\n\nWhen you cut my roommates rooms, you can split my apartment into 6 different sections.\n\nI used vanilla Sims 4, because I didn’t want Simulated Brian to accidentally become a wizard, or a skeleton,\n\nor a college student.\n\nThe first step is to make an accurate depiction of myself, both in personality and in appearance.\n\nThis took a good chunk of time, but it was worth it when I crafted an exact 1 to 1 replica\n\nof myself in the Sims. Then, I built the space. I used my measurements and gave myself close\n\nto unlimited funds to create the apartment, and bought myself the cheapest appliances\n\njust like my landlord did.\n\nAt the end of this, I had a pretty exact reproduction.\n\nThen it was test time.\n\nI gave myself a career similar to my own, and then I let Simulated Brian do his thing.\n\nMy rule was that I had to have little to no interaction.\n\nBut after a few days, it became clear that there were flaws with my experiment.\n\nOne, it was too slow.\n\nIf I want a longitudinal look at Simulated Brian’s living situation, I need to see his ENTIRE life.\n\nTwo, this experiment is meant to perfect my living situation, not my job.\n\nAnd currently, Sim Brian is finding enough fulfillment in his career, which is an uncontrolled space.\n\nSim Brian needs to stay in his apartment, and that means no job.\n\nThree, Sim Brian was perfectly content reading books,\n\nand everyone knows that books are BORING!\n\nSo I obviously need to fix whatever personality flaw turned my Sim into a dweeb.\n\nI addressed the first flaw by downloading a mod that would allow me to put on Ultra Fast Speed.\n\nI also altered my sim\'s personality to reflect my own… and I accepted that Simulated Brian’s appearance\n\nwasn’t all that accurate in the first trial, so I fixed that as well.\n\nWith the new personality traits and the ultra fast speed mod, this trial was far more accurate.\n\nI spent a lot of time standing in my bathroom, staring at the wall, or sadly contemplating my reflection.\n\nAnd then Sim Brian died of starvation after 4 days.\n\nWhich is a MASSIVE SUCCESS!\n\nI got to see the entirety of my Sim\'s life!\n\nIn trial 3, I took a hands-off approach.\n\nI popped on ultra fast speed, and I let it ride.\n\nIn this trial, I die of starvation after just 2 and a half days.\n\nWhich makes me think that this mod might be so fast that Sim Brian can’t feed himself.\n\nSo in trial 4, I start on normal fast speed,\n\nand I decide I’ll only jump to lightspeed when I’m bored.\n\nAnd things start well enough!\n\nSim Brian manages to socialize and stay happy for two days.\n\nIt starts to break down on Tuesday, when I find my sim\n\nsadly eating a grilled cheese in his empty kitchen.\n\nAnd then on Wednesday, Sim Brian sadly eats cereal while staring out the kitchen window.\n\nThings get real bad at 2 am on Thursday,\n\nwhen he stares in the mirror for hours.\n\nThe ennui has set in.\n\nThat afternoon, he stands in front of some dirty dishes on the coffee table,\n\ntoo depressed to wash them in the sink, which is mere feet away.\n\nSim Brian goes through the same motions for the next week.\n\nWatching TV. Staring in the mirror. Sleeping at random intervals. He seems devastatingly unhappy.\n\nBut he manages to live a much fuller life than the past two iterations!\n\nIt takes him nearly a week longer to die of starvation!\n\nExcept, he doesn’t really die.\n\nIn an effort to expedite the death sequence, I accidentally hit ultra fast speed,\n\nand for some reason,\n\nthis killed death.\n\nI waited, hoping the reaper would respawn, but no.\n\nSo I rushed through the days.\n\nWaiting for someone to find my collapsed body in the weird corner of my creepy hallway,\n\nbut the only people who noticed my quote unquote "death"\n\nwere the utility companies.\n\nI used this moment to look around my neighborhood.\n\nMost houses were far nicer.\n\nI was alone in a little box surrounded by neighbors who had forgotten me, or perhaps never knew I existed.\n\nEven death had forgotten me.\n\nI watched my slumped body linger in limbo as nothing changed.\n\nAfter a week, I resigned myself to quitting.\n\nAnd then in trial 5 I peed myself!\n\nA LOT!\n\nBoy, trial 5 exemplifies how much my apartment needs an upgrade.\n\nAt the beginning of the trial, my sim left the house to socialize.\n\nAnd he was so happy not being in his tiny apartment that he stayed outside for 12 hours,\n\nignoring his bodily functions, and at 9pm, while speaking to a potential new friend,\n\nhe peed himself.\n\nDoes this make the embarrassed and uncomfortable Sim go inside?\n\nNO.\n\nSim Brian so loathes his living space that he decides to stand outside all night browsing the internet,\n\nuntil again, he pees himself right before having a flirty conversation with his friend Terri.\n\nDirty, dirty Terri.\n\nAfter another full day outside,\n\nhunger, exhaustion, and the need to pee FINALLY make Sim Brian go home.\n\nHe was more willing to spend two nights soaked in piss before spending a single minute inside his apartment.\n\nBig Mood.\n\nThe rest of his life was typical. Mirror. Standing. Dying of starvation.\n\nAfter 5 control trials, it was time for the results.\n\nHere’s what I learned:\n\nOne, I’d rather spend time outside my house in repulsive conditions than spend time inside my house.\n\nSomething needs to change.\n\nTwo, the only thing that ever managed to make Sim Brian happy\n\nwas “good decoration.”\n\nI need to redecorate.\n\nAnd three, Sim Brian managed his basic needs until he became desolate due to a lack of social interaction.\n\nA hole so deep he couldn’t go anywhere but down.\n\nAnd this makes me believe that the thing that killed me was not starvation,\n\nbut rather becoming so lonely that I no longer sought to fix my situation.\n\nBut that has nothing to do with my apartment,\n\nso let’s focus on the things we can change!\n\nSimulated Brian was happiest in these terrible trials when the decorations were good,\n\nand that’s something I can fix in real life.\n\nBut before I do, let’s set some ground rules:\n\nOne, I can\'t alter any of the rooms in my apartment, or I\'d lose my security deposit.\n\nTwo, I can\'t change the furniture, because my roommates bought it, and then they’d hate me.\n\nAnd three, the money. I had considered giving my sim a budget similar to my own,\n\nbut money cannot buy happiness.\n\nAnd if this is true, then money, when compared to happiness, has no correlation.\n\nTherefore, money is no object, and my sim should be allowed to purchase anything regardless of price.\n\nInfinite money.\n\nSims decorations show how many environmental points they are worth.\n\nBy this logic, it doesn’t matter how well a room is decorated…\n\nit matters how MUCH a room is decorated.\n\nSo I spent a solid hour giving my apartment the most decorations possible.\n\nAllow me to give you a first person tour.\n\nThe Living Room now has lots of beautiful paintings.\n\nThe Weird Nook now has a purpose as The JAZZ Room, because for some reason,\n\nthe Sims has SO MANY JAZZ PAINTINGS.\n\nThe TV has to stay, but now I have three maps around it to say, “I’m also smart sometimes.”\n\nThe Kitchen hasn’t changed because it’s small and there’s no space to hang anything.\n\nThe creepiness of the hallway has crystallized into Sad Clowns.\n\nNo one wanted to spend much time in this hallway before,\n\nand now they REALLY don’t want to.\n\nIn my room, a bunch of portraits, an apple wall, and a pear wall.\n\nThis should remind my sim to eat food.\n\nAnd finally, in the bathroom, I installed a second mirror so I can’t just stare at the wall.\n\nNow let’s see it in action.\n\nIn the first trial, I did another hands off approach on ultra fast speed,\n\nand my sim once again died of starvation super quickly.\n\nSo, yeah, maybe the mod is too strong.\n\nBUT! In trial 2, things go way better.\n\nFor the first time in any of the trials,\n\nmy sim manages to go from Very Sad to Happy, thanks to the tasteful decorations!\n\nThough Sim Brian has moments of ennui and loneliness, for the most part, the house is making him happier.\n\nSim Brian does so well that he survives after the utilities shut off his power and water,\n\nand he dies of starvation after more than two weeks.\n\nThat’s nearly DOUBLE the length of any of the other trials!\n\nMY DECORATIONS WORKED!\n\nYeah, I still die of starvation, but I’m living TWICE AS LONG!\n\nAnd that’s all the proof I need that this is the perfect form of my apartment.\n\nAll I gotta do now is make it in real life.\n\nPolygon said that they wouldn’t reimburse me for purchasing thousands of dollars worth of paintings,\n\neven though I TOLD them it would make me more productive,\n\nso I gave myself a budget.\n\nThen I went to a lot of thrift stores to purchase\n\nas many paintings as I could find.\n\nSome fit the aesthetic. Others would need alterations.\n\nBut I got a lot of things! Or, I thought I had, until I got home and realized\n\nit wasn’t even going to cover one of my walls, let alone all six rooms.\n\nSo I dug around my apartment to find anything that could be stuck on the walls.\n\nIn the end, I was able to fill the entrance, but the rest of the living room was pretty sparse.\n\nIn the Jazz room I put up a papier mache man playing the piano, a dart board that felt pretty jazz to me,\n\nand a skeleton wearing a tank top that says "I heart my Daddy,"\n\nbecause...\n\nI honestly didn’t know where else I could put that.\n\nIn my own room, I put up the appletini painting and\n\nhung a huge self portrait from my senior year of high school.\n\nAnd that was it.\n\nThat’s all I had in terms of decorations.\n\nI took the day off to do this, but I was done in an hour.\n\nI even put on my suit in order to film the results of the trial,\n\nbut my house felt as empty as it had when I began.\n\nI couldn’t start the live experiment because I couldn’t recreate my sim’s house.\n\nBut I wasn’t giving up.\n\nIf I couldn’t purchase the decorations I needed, I figured I could make them myself.\n\nSo I bought a bunch of washable paint and 1000 feet of butcher paper.\n\n“I don\'t need any paper!”\n\nI lied.\n\nIt was a week before Thanksgiving. I was going to be out of town\n\nand I needed to finish this part of the video before I left.\n\nThat meant I had to create about 70 large paintings in less than three days.\n\nI got a solid start, painting all of the apples and pears.\n\nI even managed to edit the two paintings I got from the thrift store into Sad Clowns.\n\nBut I was halfway through the second Sad Clown when this process started weighing on me.\n\nIf I had to spend a few hours on 10 of the simplest paintings,\n\nthere was no way I was gonna get this finished before deadline.\n\nI was alone in an apartment making shitty paintings for a video that wasn’t gonna get made in time.\n\nI got a stress migraine, so I turned off the camera, and I went to lie down.\n\nWhen I woke up from that heinous nap,\n\nI decided to do one of the most difficult things I’ve had to do for an Unraveled:\n\nI asked for help.\n\nAnd if you’ve never had to ask your friends and coworkers\n\nto help you paint terrible paintings for a stupid video,\n\nlet me say you’re not missing out on much.\n\nIt’s an uncomfortable thing to ask people to do.\n\nAnd honestly, the weirdest part of this whole process is that...\n\npeople said yes.\n\nPeople said they\'d come help me paint.\n\nAnd, and they said yes just because they wanted to,\n\nand also \'cause I said I’d buy pizza,\n\nbut you gotta grease the wheels somehow.\n\nSo I turned my house into a painting factory. I cut the paper. I moved the furniture.\n\nAnd that night, people came over. Not just my roommate and my coworkers but my friends,\n\nand friends of those friends.\n\nI was expecting one or two people to help me, but I ended up with 10 people in my house,\n\nall painting large scale portraits\n\nand REALLY GOOD SAD CLOWNS.\n\nSeriously, who knew that my friends were SO GOOD at painting sad clowns?\n\nI don’t 100% know how to feel about how good my friends are at painting sad clowns,\n\nbut I\'m glad I gave \'em an outlet.\n\nAll of these people came over just to make my apartment happier.\n\nTo lend a hand when I was overwhelmed.\n\nAnd not only were they helping me make my apartment happier by decorating it,\n\nthey made it happier just by being there.\n\nThis task that had given me a stress migraine became a really fun time.\n\nAnd it reminded me that, although it can sometimes feel uncomfortable or embarrassing,\n\nif you ask for help, more often than not,\n\npeople are willing to help\n\nyou paint large pictures of jazz men.\n\nIn three hours, a task that seemed insurmountable by myself was complete.\n\nAnd I was so excited that I did the walkthrough while they were all still there.\n\nThe Living room with fabulous landscapes,\n\nThe Jazz room’s huge murals.\n\nThe Creepy clown hallway that was way too good.\n\nMy room with its amazing portraits and fruit walls.\n\nAnd the bathroom, where I stared at myself,\n\nnot considering my flaws or my apartment, but just smiling.\n\nThat’s it.\n\nJust smiling.\n\nIt’s been well over two weeks since my apartment was redecorated,\n\nwhich is longer than I survived in the Sims trials,\n\nso it’s been an incredible success.\n\nMy apartment is perfected, I’m happier with it, and it’s all thanks to the redecoration.\n\nOr at least, that’s part of it.\n\nI think that part of the reason I find so much joy in my apartment is knowing\n\nthat the decorations were made by people I care about.\n\nThere’s a story behind it.\n\nSimulated Brian fell further into sadness due to his isolation,\n\nbut the paint night turned Reality Brian’s terrible situation into something joyous.\n\nSo I have to wonder:\n\nDoes my newly perfected apartment make me happier because of the decorations,\n\nor because of the people who helped me decorate it?\n\nTrick question, it’s obviously the decorations.\n\n*club beat*\n\n*saxophone solo*\n\n*mouth trumpet noises*\n\n*dart rebounds off the board*\n\nJESUS! ', ' Ah, the Elder Scrolls, games chock-full of lore.\n\nAnd Skyrim is no different.\n\nHidden amongst the draugr and dragons is a plethora of books full of very important\n\nand incredibly niche details.\n\nBut with all the spellcasting and shouting you must do as dragonborn, who really has\n\nthe time to read all those books.\n\nI DO.\n\nAPPARENTLY.\n\nI read every book in Skyrim in order to answer the eternal question, “Should you read every\n\nbook in Skyrim?”\n\nAnd I’m here to give you my top five recommendations of books, here in my SKYRIM BOOK REPORT.\n\nSkyrim book report!\n\nHow many books are there, really, in Skyrim?\n\nAfter all, there are only eight people credited as writers on Skyrim.\n\nThose eight people are responsible for every quest, every voice acting line, every response\n\nyou can give to an NPC.\n\nHow much time do they have to write all those other books?\n\nA lot!\n\nBecause they wrote this many books.\n\nThis many books.\n\n*pained grin*\n\nOr at least they wrote most of them because a few of them have been grandfathered in from\n\nother Elder Scrolls games.\n\nBefore I get into the nitty gritty, let me explain my process on how I did this Skyrim\n\nBook Report.\n\nI printed out every book in Skryim, and then I spent multiple eight-hour days reading EVERY.\n\nSINGLE.\n\nBOOK.\n\nI whittled it down to 338 books because I didn’t include journals or diaries.\n\nEveryone knows that self-published doesn’t count.\n\nIn total, that’s 571 pages, five and a half point font, over three hundred and sixteen\n\nTHOUSAND words.\n\nI had two reactions to this.\n\nMy first reaction was, “Wow.”\n\nThis is an incredible amount of world building.\n\nTo write 300,000 words that could essentially be skipped over while still having the full\n\nSkyrim experience, it’s amazing, and it’s a level of world building that could only\n\nexist in an interactive medium.\n\nAnd for that, I commend you, Bethesda.\n\nMy second reaction to this,\n\nwas WHAT THE FUCK.\n\nHEY TODD?\n\nWHAT THE FU-\n\nIn my Skyrim Book Report, I will be discussing:\n\n*smack*\n\nThat’s a smash cut.\n\nHopefully.\n\nIf I do my editing correctly.\n\n338 books.\n\nUh, actually, 337, I just realized, um, over here, Songs of Skyrim, I put both of them\n\nin there, but there’s a revised edition.\n\nI lied.\n\nIt’s just 337 books now.\n\nObviously, I don’t have time to synopsize all of these, and believe me, you wouldn’t\n\nwant to watch that even if I could.\n\nI’ve split them into categories to make this a little bit easier.\n\nFirst up, historical books!\n\nThese book titles you see rolling up the screen are all biographies or histories.\n\nWhat I categorized as histories was anything that had big historical dates in them, explanatory\n\nhistories, or pretty much anything that was boring.\n\nHistory’s so BORING.\n\nUGHHHH.\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien\n\n*kiss*\n\ndid the world a disservice by making every single fantasy writer think\n\nthat they need to chronicle every goddamn minute of their world in order for it to be\n\nlegitimate.\n\nI don’t give two shits about a king who lost a war 700 years ago.\n\n*snoring noises* Get OUTTA here!\n\nSome of these biographies are actually pretty interesting.\n\nBut a lot of them are written like The Chronicles of Nchuleft.\n\nI didn’t tab it out ‘cause it’s a shitty story.\n\n“It happened in Second Planting (P.D. 1220) that Lord Ihlendam, on a journey in the Western\n\nUplands, came to Nchuleft; and Protector Anchard and General Rkungthunch met him there, and\n\nDalen-Zanchu also came to the meeting.\n\nThey talked together long by themselves; but this only was known of their business, that\n\nthey were to be friends of each other.\n\nThey parted, and each went home to his own colony.”\n\nRIVETING.\n\nUgh.\n\nHistory’s so boring.\n\nI’m done with this.\n\nNext category: Instructional books!\n\nThese are all field guides or basic recipes about how to make good armor or what flowers\n\ngo in which potions.\n\nAt best, they are in-fiction instructional books.\n\nAt worst, they are so obviously trying to get you to go do specific things.\n\nPulls you right out of the fiction!\n\nC’mon man.\n\nThat’s all I’m gonna say about that.\n\nEveryone’s favorite: the academic books.\n\nFun fact about academic books that I learned in college\n\nis that no one has ever enjoyed writing or reading an academic paper.\n\nWHY’D YOU PUT IT IN A VIDEO GAME.\n\nMythicaaaaal stories.\n\nIt’s kind of weird to differentiate things between myth and history, especially in this\n\nworld where you can talk to demon princes.\n\nI split these two up because these are very boring and these are slightly more palatable.\n\nThey’re more like creation myths, or they’re just like random stories that are fun to read,\n\nso they’re getting closer to good fiction.\n\nThe poetic and dramatic.\n\nEveryone knows that poetry and theatre are meant to be seen and not read.\n\nAnd you have NO IDEA how much it pains me that I do not have time to do staged readings\n\nof all these.\n\nOh my GOD I would have loved that.\n\nWe have “eh.”\n\nWhat genre is “eh?”\n\nIt’s the catchall.\n\nUm, these tend to be accounts, kind of like medieval fantasy op-eds.\n\nSo I…\n\nI just put ‘em here.\n\nEH!\n\nWe’re done with these now, so…\n\nGet outta here!\n\nFinally, we have 59 books that I would consider good fiction.\n\nGooooOOOD fiction.\n\nWhat I did here is I gave myself three criteria about what would make good fiction in the\n\nrealm of Skyrim.\n\nNumber one, does it help build the world around us?\n\nNumber two, does it give us an interesting or different perspective on that world?\n\nAnd number three, is it good?\n\nNow you might say, “Brian, what gives you the right to say what is good fiction?”\n\nI READ ALL 338 YA DINGUS.\n\nBELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY THAT THESE WERE THE ONLY GOOD ONES.\n\nTHIS IS ALL I’M QUALIFIED TO DO NOW.\n\nI need a drink.\n\n*deep breath*\n\nOkay!\n\nThere’s still 59 of these, so I obviously can’t summarize all of them, but I have\n\nleft five off, and they are my top five books of Skyrim.\n\nSo we’re gonna talk about those.\n\nNumber five, Advances in Lockpicking.\n\nNow Advances in Lockpicking is actually an instructional book.\n\nBut I think it does more than just the other instructional books, where you open them up\n\nand suddenly you’re better at lockpicking, because it’s written by a thief in a very\n\ninteresting voice.\n\nThere’s a great ending line for this book: “Some thieves can’t read.\n\nIf you can’t read, get someone to read this book to you.\n\nIt will make more sense then.”\n\nThat’s great.\n\nI think that’s a much more fun way than saying, “Here is how you pick a lock.\n\nThis is what this set of armor is.”\n\nBetter than instructional.\n\nJust good fiction.\n\nNumber four, Palla.\n\nIn a world where crazy creatures exist, how do you make fiction that is compelling that\n\npeople can just kind of experience in their own life.\n\nPalla is a necromantic romantic book.\n\nIt’s a story about a man who sees this beautiful statue of a woman fighting a beast and falls\n\ninstantly in love with this woman.\n\nTurns out, she’s dead!\n\nFrom fighting that beast.\n\nHe decides to get into necromancy to bring her back from the dead.\n\nI kind of don’t want to ruin the surprise for you.\n\nIt manages to tell an interesting story while also introducing these ideas of monsters and\n\nnecromancy.\n\nIt’s kind of weird, but it’s very well written.\n\nI’m gonna go ahead and put up three and two.\n\nWhy do I put up the Argonian Account and Feyfolken at the same time?\n\nTurns out, it’s written by the same fictional author: WAUGHIN JARTH.\n\nThis one’s for you, Waughin!\n\nI’m a big Jarth head!\n\nHe’s not actually in the story at all, I couldn’t find any instance of, like, him\n\nas an NPC.\n\nSo I really hope he’s in the next one.\n\nBecause I want to meet Waughin.\n\nI just want to meet Waughin Jarth.\n\nThese ones were not actually written specifically for Skyrim.\n\nThey were grandfathered in.\n\nBut they do an incredible job of building the world around you.\n\nThe Argonian Account is actually the second story in a series all about Decumus Scotti.\n\nThis is kind of like the Hobbit of Tamriel, where we’re taking this unassuming character\n\nand thrusting them into this completely foreign, amazing landscape, except instead of a hobbit,\n\nit is a midlevel bureaucrat.\n\nIt’s full of screwball comedy and wonderful worldbuilding about the Black Marsh which\n\nis where all the Argonians live.\n\nYou have to fast travel by being eaten alive by a worm.\n\nThat’s great.\n\nI want to see that whenever we go to the Black Marsh.\n\nIt’s so flavorful, and that’s why I’m a Jarth head.\n\nFeyfolken.\n\nIt’s a story about a scribe who’s terrible at his job but gets this enchanted quill that\n\nforces him to be amazing.\n\nSends himself into this madness, and he kills himself at the end of the book, spoiler alert.\n\nBut that’s not what this story is really about.\n\nIt’s an interesting fiction that teaches you about different Daedric princes, and which\n\nones could have caused this specific enchantment on the quill.\n\nThat’s good worldbuilding!\n\nI am interested in the story!\n\nYou told me something that I can learn about the world.\n\nI had a good time reading Feyfolken!\n\nJarth, ya did it again!\n\nAnd that leaves us with the number one book.\n\nIt’s not The Lusty Argonian Maid.\n\nI feel like I should broach this subject.\n\nI’ll tell you why I didn’t include it in my good fiction list,\n\nand it’s not because I’m a prude, who doesn’t love a little erotic lizard fiction?\n\n*OOH COME ON BABY*\n\nThe reason I didn’t include The Lusty Argonian Maid as one of the best\n\npieces of fiction is because it’s SEVEN ACTS LONG.\n\nSeven acts?\n\nThere is no way you can manage to maintain that level of erotic tension for seven acts.\n\nThat’s like five and a half hours!\n\nAs a person who has done one or two plays in my life, that’s just unfeasible.\n\nOkay?\n\nI’d like to see them try.\n\n~I would like to see them try~\n\n*OOH COME ON BABY*\n\nBefore I go to number one, I gotta go\n\nget a flu shot.\n\nThis is not a joke.\n\nIt’s important to get your flu shot.\n\nAlright, I’m back.\n\nThe number one piece of fiction in Skyrim, not Waughin Jarth, I’m sorry.\n\nIt’s Beggar, Thief, Warrior, King.\n\nIt’s four books, actually.\n\nBut it’s all part of Eslaf Erol’s story.\n\nIt is completely fiction even within the fiction of Skyrim.\n\nThe reason I put it first is because it’s the only book that was legitimately hilarious.\n\nI straight up chortled.\n\n*chortle*\n\nThat’s what I did.\n\nIn real life.\n\nThat’s amazing.\n\nThe writing style of these four books is just naturally hilarious.\n\nThere are so many bland, cookie-cutter stories in Skyrim that follow the same set up, twist, punchline.\n\nThis doesn’t have that.\n\nIt’s just a good story.\n\nOne of these writers was just flexing, and I think that’s wonderful that a writer had\n\na chance to—within the fiction of Skyrim—write something that’s just naturally funny.\n\nYou should all go home, onto your computers, boot up Skyrim, find these four books, and\n\nthen read them, in order.\n\nIt’s worth it!\n\nThat’s my quest, for you in Skyrim.\n\n300 gold points.\n\nThat’s it!\n\nThat’s it, that’s all of the books.\n\nSo like, what did I learn from reading all 338 books of Skyrim?\n\nSurprisingly, a whole lot.\n\nLike, there are two main takeaways that I pulled from this.\n\nNumber one, this is a masterclass on how to write effective flavor text.\n\nBetween all of these, historical, instructional, the good fiction, and, you know, the iffy fiction.\n\nThis is a way to learn what to do and what not to do.\n\nObviously, not everyone is going to connect with certain types of flavor text.\n\nI’m sure there’s a lot of people that disagree with me and think that the historical\n\nis the most important flavor text.\n\nAnd you know what?\n\nThey are valid.\n\nAnd they’re wrong.\n\nAnd they always seem to find my comment sections.\n\nWhen you take something good like Feyfolken which teaches you about the Daedric princes,\n\nbut in an interesting way, it really shines in comparison to the three and a half million\n\nbiographies of Barenziah.\n\nYou don’t even see them in Skyrim.\n\nI don’t care about Barenziah.\n\nIT’S BORIIIIIII-\n\nBut not like Feyfolken!\n\nThat’s really interesting and effective.\n\nAlso it just teaches you about all these wonderful forms of fiction.\n\nIf you’re a fiction teacher, like, teach your kids with Skyrim!\n\nTEACH THE KIDS.\n\nWITH SKYRIM.\n\nI got a creative writing degree.\n\nThat’s all I have to say about that.\n\nSecond takeaway, this is a wonderful teaching device about unreliable narrators.\n\nSo many of these histories are negating other ones.\n\nThis is a wonderful way of showing people you need to read everything if you’re going\n\nto get the whole picture.\n\nI read everything.\n\nI am the keeper of the picture.\n\nThat’s every book in Skyrim.\n\nSo it’s time for us to revisit that ever present question, “Should you read every\n\nbook in Skyrim?”\n\nNO!\n\nWHAT?\n\nHOW COULD YOU WATCH THIS WHOLE 10+ MINUTE VIDEO AND THINK THAT I WOULD SAY ANYTH- WHAT?\n\nNO!\n\nI BORE THIS BURDEN!\n\nFOR YOU!\n\nDON’T READ THEM!\n\nNO!\n\nPlease don’t read them all.\n\nDON’T READ THEM!\n\nYou can read the top five, that’s fine.\n\nGRRRRR.\n\nHOW DARE YOU JETTISON MY GIFT!\n\nDON’T READ THEM!\n\nNOOOOOOOOOOO\n\nIf you want to see me keep doing things like this, make sure to hit that subscribe button.\n\nAnd now for a staged reading of The Sultry Argonian Bard.\n\nPat: I could never perform your request.\n\nBDG: Oh!\n\nIs it too fast for you.\n\nPat: I fear I may damage my… instrument.\n\nBDG: Ah, but you seem to handle it so well my darling.\n\nPat: My lady you flatter me.\n\nBDG: Well it is such a LARGE and MAGNIFICENT piece. ', " Sonic the Hedgehog has been enjoying a bit of resurgence as of late\n\nbecause of his upcoming feature film.\n\nWhich is great because\n\nOH! OH THOSE LEGS ARE WAY TOO HUMAN.\n\nTHOSE LEGS ARE...\n\nOH MY GOD.\n\nTHOSE LEGS LOOK LIKE I COULD HAVE THOSE LEGS.\n\nPLEASE DON'T SHOW THAT TO ME ANYMORE.\n\nPLEASE GET.\n\nGET IT OUT OF HERE.\n\nscreaming\n\nThis new Sonic has a lot of fans crying heresy.\n\nSonic should be that cute, blue, cartoon hedgehog that’s gotta go fast,\n\nand that’s all he’s gotta do.\n\nBut what if I told you that this was not the only blasphemous version of Sonic\n\nWhat if I told you that nearly every single piece of Sonic media was heretical\n\nI hold in my hand 13 pages that prove just that.\n\nBefore I hop into the deep end, I need to explain a little about Sega, these 13 pages,\n\nand how Sonic was made.\n\nYou see, Sega was in a real tough spot in the early ‘90s as it tried to compete with\n\nNintendo and the overwhelmingly successful Mario.\n\nSo they worked internally to create a new mascot.\n\nNot just for a game, but for the company as a whole.\n\nNaoto Ohshima created Mr. Needlemouse, a teal hedgehog with red sneakers.\n\nAnd then he worked with Yuji Naka to create a game around this wonderful creature.\n\nA few tweaks and Sonic the Hedgehog was born.\n\nOr at least one version of Sonic was born.\n\nYou see, Sega wasn’t just fighting with Nintendo, it was also fighting with itself.\n\nSega of America and Sega of Japan had a lot of tension between them, and they didn’t\n\nsee eye to eye on a lot of things, especially when it came to Sonic.\n\nThe original version of Sonic was a bit more punk rock and had a girlfriend.\n\nA real life human girlfriend named Madonna.\n\nAnd we all know that Sega would never make Sonic kiss a real human woman.\n\ndiscomfort\n\nSo Sega of America started to iron things out a little bit.\n\nMake Sonic a bit more family friendly.\n\nMore marketable.\n\nMadeline Schroeder, the self-described mother of Sonic, wrote out this 13-page bible that\n\nset out Sonic's true origins.\n\nThese 13 pages went on to become the true Sonic.\n\nThe Sonic we all know and love.\n\nRight\n\nNOPE.\n\nTHIS BIBLE HAS HAD VERY LITTLE BEARING ON THE SERIES AS A WHOLE.\n\nBut here’s the thing, friends.\n\nIt should have a lot of bearing on the series as a whole.\n\nAnd I am willing to wield this bible as a paladin wields a holy sword so that I might\n\nEXCISE SIN OUT FROM THE SONIC CANON.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nThat was a lot.\n\nI was a bit too intense for...\n\nI'm gonna tone it down a little bit.\n\nFolks, we’re about to engage in a friendly session of biblical literalism.\n\nNow, I’m not one to advocate taking a written account as the pure truth and nothing but...\n\nbut for Sonic I’m willing to bend my values a little bit.\n\nWe're about to take everything written in these 13 pages as gospel, and anything that deviates\n\nfrom the facts therein as sacrilege.\n\nLet’s get Sonically Fundamental.\n\nI’m not gonna read this bible in its entirety.\n\nYou can read it online if you'd like.\n\nBut I am going to read the first paragraph in full, because I think it's important for\n\nyou to understand what we’re dealing with.\n\n“Sonny Hedgehog was born on Earth in the early 21st century, in the town of Hardly,\n\nNebraska, population 1,226.”\n\nFrom the first line alone, we already know that\n\n1. Sonic’s birth name is actually Sonny.\n\n2. He is a real hedgehog that was born circa 2000.\n\nAnd 3. He’s a midwestern boy.\n\n“He and his mother and five sisters live underneath a scraggly hedge beside the local\n\nburger joint, and subsist on burger scraps, milkshakes, and the occasional slug or bug\n\nthat crawls their way.\n\nThey are a poor but happy family.”\n\nFrom these lines we know that\n\n4. Sonic's family lives in an actual hedge, which is I guess why they're called hedgehogs.\n\nAnd 5. They have a very similar diet to me.\n\n“Unfortunately, Sonny’s dad died when Sonny was just a few days old, after falling\n\ninto a gurgling, festering vat of toxic waste dumped in a nearby pond.”\n\n…\n\nWhat\n\nSonic, the lighthearted hedgehog we all know and love.\n\nNever knew his father because he was reduced to sludge thanks to corporate pollution.\n\nThere are 30 key tenets in the Sonic bible,\n\nand I'm just gonna go ahead and list them off real quick.\n\njust a big ol' mess of words from the Sonic bible\n\nThe 30 tenets of the Sonic the Hedgehog bible.\n\nLook at 'em up there.\n\nBeautiful.\n\nPractically glowing with potential energy.\n\nThe potential energy I shall release into a HOLY FLAME, SO THAT I MIGHT BURN OUT THE\n\nBLASPHEMY FROM SONIC'S MODERN ITERATIO...\n\nPat I think, uh, we should probably just take a couple minutes, just to, just to like...\n\nBrian Okay.\n\nPat I'll... do you need water or anything\n\nBrian Water... yeah, I think that'd be good.\n\nNow, most of these are not found in most of the iterations of Sonic, but there are three\n\nthat specifically decanonize every game in the Sonic franchise.\n\nLet's talk about 'em.\n\nNumber 18 There are seven chaos emeralds, one is a stabilizer.\n\nYou might have heard me say the name Kintobor.\n\nHe turns into Dr. Robotnik after he is fused the powers of the chaos emeralds and a hard-boiled egg.\n\nNot a joke.\n\nBut he was originally looking for the chaos emeralds so that we he could bundle them up\n\nand then launch them into space, thus reversing all pollution on the planet Earth.\n\nThe reason for that is because the Chaos Emeralds “contain a microlytic copy of all the inert\n\nenergy of every gross and disgusting impulse or deed done by humans since the beginning of time.”\n\nIgnoring that microlytic is the name of a company and not an actual scientific term,\n\nthis seems to state that the chaos emeralds are just a crystalline form of every gross impulse.\n\nEvery time you pick your nose instead of using a tissue.\n\nThat’s in the emerald.\n\nEvery time you wear your underwear five times in a week 'cause you think it doesn't smell that bad.\n\nThat's in the emerald.\n\nEvery time you go three days without shampooing\n\nI get it.\n\nLook, sometimes, you know, the shampoo has sulfates and that can damage to your hair.\n\nWe all have different scalps.\n\nBUT THAT'S IN THE EMERALD, TOO.\n\nMost of the games just state the chaos emeralds are an incredible source of power, something\n\nthat will help you to take over the world or become Super Sonic.\n\nThey don't ever mention that they are essentially just garbage diamonds.\n\nHad Sega included one piece of flavor text, like “You got a chaos emerald.\n\nYou should probably go wash your hands, now.”\n\nThen it would’ve been fine.\n\nBut they didn’t.\n\nNumber 21 Kintobor was a father figure.\n\nJust as a reminder, Sonic’s dad died in a vat\n\nof toxic waste.\n\nWhich is why it meant so much when Kintobor offered him an assistantship.\n\n“Sonny was thrilled at the prospect.\n\nBecause although Sonny had never known his father, Kintobor reminded him of the kind\n\nface in the photograph.”\n\nHeartbreaking.\n\nCan you imagine the drama in this\n\nSega, you keep trying to do these gritty reboots of Sonic.\n\nSonic plus gun.\n\nSonic plus getting kissed by a human woman.\n\nYou don’t need all that.\n\nIt's all right here!\n\nYou are literally pitting Sonic, a hedgehog without a father, against the man who became\n\nhis father figure and then turned evil thanks to the machines that SONIC HELPED CREATE.\n\nI hear you saying, “Brian, there’s no evidence that Sonic doesn’t think of Robotnik\n\nas a father figure!”\n\nAnd to that I say bullSHIT.\n\nI have NEVER SEEN HIM CRY AFTER DEFEATING ROBOTNIK.\n\nI HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM HOLD THE LIFELESS BODY OF HIS FATHER FIGURE AND SAY,\n\nI am sorry it had to turn out like this!\n\nI am sorry!\n\nLET SONIC CRY OVER THE LOSS OF WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN, SEGA.\n\nYOU COWARDS.\n\nAnd finally, the third and most important tenet that destroys the entirety of the Sonic canon.\n\nNumber 11 Sonic helps quilters.\n\nHave you ever seen Sonic in a quilting circle\n\nCause he should be there.\n\n“While making the rounds for juicy tidbits and gossip, he would drop in on the ladies\n\nof the local quilting circle to offer a convenient pin or needle from his ample, portable supply.”\n\nWHERE IS MY SONIC GAME WITH A QUILTING CIRCLE\n\nSonic CD shitty.\n\nSonic Mania trash.\n\nSonic Hedgehog 2.\n\nMore like Sonic the Hedgehog Too MUCH OF A DUNCE TO INCLUDE TO THE QUILTING CIRCLE THAT\n\nIS SO INTEGRAL TO SONIC'S BACKSTORY!\n\nAnd with that, we have decanonized the entirety of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise.\n\nBut from this scorched earth can bloom a mighty flower.\n\nThe true Sonic the Hedgehog.\n\nWhat would that video game look like\n\nWhat are the ramifications of a Sonic the Hedgehog game based on the bible\n\nThe Sonic the Hedgehog bible.\n\nLet’s go through this piece by piece.\n\nWe start the game with a legitimate hedgehog who lives in a hedge and his name is Sonny.\n\nAnd it's 2019, and he's got brown quills, and they won't become blue until he gets faster.\n\nAnd he eats food that is similar to the food that I eat.\n\nHe lives in Hardly, Nebraska, which is where the entire game is set, so you better get ready\n\nfor running in lots of corn fields.\n\nHis eyesight’s not good, but it’s okay cause he’ll get rec specs since he is able\n\nto read but is also on the track team.\n\nSo the entire game is actually just running in track meets in the middle of a corn field.\n\nWhen he’s not running track, he’s at the bowling alley or the playground or the quilting\n\ncircle doing normal hedgehog things.\n\nThe problem is that his town has SO MUCH POLLUTION, which is how his dad died, and it’s also\n\nwhy Kintobor (now Robotnik), the trim kindly scientist who gave Sonic his new nickname\n\nand the ability to speak the human tongue, was trying to solve with his new physics theories\n\nand his machines and all of those terrible gross seven chaos emeralds before he became\n\nevil and also a bit of an egg.\n\nThis is especially rough because Kintobor, before he became Robotnik, would feed Sonic\n\nreally good food and was basically a father figure to him.\n\nAlso Sonic is good at computer science.\n\nSo the game is basically an evil polluting scientist being taken down by a midwestern\n\nteenage hedgehog track star with daddy issues.\n\nSo it’s basically if the CW rebooted Sonic.\n\nReach out to me, CW, I will license this.\n\nBut I haven’t used all 30 of these tenets.\n\nSee, there are four of them that, to be perfectly honest, shouldn’t be possible.\n\nAnd beyond that, they are impossible to put into a game.\n\nI've hit a bit of a roadblock.\n\nNumber seven shows Sonic's dead father winking at him through a picture on the wall, which\n\nproves the existence of an afterlife in the Sonic Universe.\n\nNumber 15 shows that Sonic is able to hibernate below delta waves.\n\nAnd those are the slowest possible brain waves.\n\nAbout 0.5 hertz.\n\nTo go below them, Sonic would have probably died.\n\nAnd yet he is resurrected and lives again.\n\nAnd number 24, Sonic is shown to run at the speed of light.\n\nAnd if the rules of relativity are to be believed, that means his mass would have to infinitely\n\nexpand, and he would need infinite energy to do this.\n\nAnd that would destroy the world.\n\nAnd yet he is able to do that without harming himself or those around him.\n\nNumber 30 is actually within the bible itself.\n\nIt states, “But like most peaceful times in the twenty-first century, it didn’t last long.”\n\nThis bible was written in 1991, nine years before the twenty-first century, and yet it\n\nprophesied our challenging political landscape.\n\nThese four pieces of information are not purely canonical information.\n\nThey are...\n\ndivine miracles.\n\nSo of course I could not put them into a game.\n\nThey could only fit in a religion.\n\nSo I went on to wikiHow, the foremost explainer of how to do things, and I knew somewhere,\n\nhidden in their beautiful imagery would be the way that I could spread the word of Sonic\n\nto the masses.\n\nAnd before you get upset with me, saying,\n\nBrian, aren't you just starting a cult\n\nLook at this question answered by Cutegirlcorr\n\nTechnically speaking, religions and cults are the same thing.\n\nSo I have formed my religion around Sonic the Hedgehog.\n\nAnd guess what\n\nI have a confession!\n\nI'VE NEVER PLAYED A SONIC GAME.\n\nNEVER IN MY LIFE.\n\nI only tell you this now because you've already made it this far into the video,\n\nand the sunk cost fallacy states that if you feel like you've invested something,\n\nyou're gonna see it through to the end.\n\nBut it's okay that I haven't played a Sonic game.\n\nBecause that means I haven't been tainted!\n\nI have never beheld the false Sonic!\n\nOnly someone blind to the modern blasphemies of the Sonic franchise\n\ncould see as clearly as I!\n\nBecause if a hedgehog could commune with the dead,\n\nbe resurrected,\n\nrun with infinite energy,\n\nand HAVE HIS GOSPEL PROPHECY THE FUTURE,\n\nTHEN EITHER SONIC IS A GOD\n\nOR COULD KILL GOD\n\nAND I DO NOT CARE IF THERE IS A DIFFERENCE!\n\nHello, friends, I’d like to take a moment now and apologize for my recent outburst.\n\nI’ve taken some time and cooled down since filming this video, and though I suppose I\n\ncould have just not uploaded it to YouTube, I decided it would serve well as a cautionary tale.\n\nYou see, taking lore to be purely literal, whether that's for a video game or backstory\n\nfor a TV show, is a dangerous rabbit hole that can often lead to anger.\n\nBiblical literalism is just an early form of fandom.\n\nSometimes, you gotta be a little bit more lenient.\n\nBecause sometimes, the bible was written to make a character\n\nmore marketable to kids in the '90s.\n\nSo let’s learn from this example, and make sure to take new additions to our favorite things in stride.\n\nEven if it’s these legs.\n\nI’m sorry, I can't in good conscience agree with that.\n\nI do not agree with those legs.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nI could spr... if you spray painted my legs blue, I could cosplay as this Sonic.\n\nDo you think I should do that\n\nDo you think I should spray paint my legs blue for a Sonic cosplay\n\nJust half...\n\nJust half, half down Sonic.\n\nNot gonna do anything else to my body, just...\n\nWhat are the ramifications of a Sonic the Hedgehog game based on the bible\n\neveryone loses it ", ' Stamina! That mysterious green juice that powers our muscles.\n\nIn video games, it allows characters to cleave dragons, climb volcanoes,\n\nand lightly jog through a prairie.\n\nI look at these heroic tasks, and I think…\n\nHow?\n\nLook, I’m usually pretty high energy, but the fact of the matter is that\n\nI’ve been stuck at home for the past two months\n\nand I’ve cultivated the stamina of a cartoon basset hound.\n\nI used to be so much more productive, and my energy has just completely vanished.\n\nIs it because I’ve been having trouble adjusting to this new working-from-home lifestyle?\n\nOr is it because my build is trash?\n\nToday, I’m saying goodbye to that boring, languid Brian, and I am going to use the things I’ve learned\n\nfrom video games to maximize my stamina.\n\n*synth music*\n\nI gotta go ham on these graphics ‘cause I don’t have a studio anymore.\n\nThere are two main ways that stamina is represented in video games:\n\nstamina bars that automatically replenish, and stamina bars that don’t.\n\nAnd these different representations lead to different techniques for boosting that stamina.\n\nMy hypothesis is that if I use these same stamina techniques in real life,\n\nthen I will finally have the energy to address laundry chair.\n\n*Sad accordion music*\n\nThere are four methods of augmenting your stamina in video games.\n\nLet’s start with the easiest one to understand. Item Refills.\n\nYou expend some energy, you eat something to replenish that energy. It\'s basic biology.\n\nThe Krebs cycle or something like that…\n\nI am not interested, get that shit outta here.\n\nThe problem is that most video games are usually more fantastical than real life.\n\nOftentimes the item you need to consume is an elixir made from arcane magicks\n\nsiphoned from the very lifeblood that sustains our world.\n\nOr, if you’re Hideo Kojima, it’s Monster Energy.\n\nGod bless you Death Stranding for having a magical canteen\n\nthat effortlessly turns dangerous Timefall into a branded energy drink.\n\nYou know, for a video game that loves to give you a 40-minute-long cutscene\n\nexplaining why some dipshit is named "HOTWETMAN" or whatever,\n\nthis piece of world building has a much simpler explanation:\n\nMONEY.\n\nAnd thanks to this shameless product placement, I have a concrete way to determine how to refill stamina.\n\nJudging by Sam’s experience, it takes about 600 milliliters of Monster Energy to fully juice your bar.\n\nAnd given the fact that this logic exists in a world where everyone is stuck in isolated homes\n\nand delivery people are among the most important of essential workers,\n\nI think it’s safe to say that conditions could not be better suited for this experiment.\n\nThe biggest difference between me and Sam Bridges is that I’m not getting paid by Monster Energy,\n\nso I don’t have to pretend to like it.\n\nTechnique 2: Slowing Depletion.\n\nUnlike item refills, this one asks you to do some planning.\n\nYou only consume one of these items before you have to do a huge task,\n\nso it usually shows up in games where preparation is key,\n\nlike when you have to go fight a 40-ton pickle.\n\nMonster Hunter has battles that can last upwards of an hour,\n\nwhich can make the preparation as important, and as long, as the actual fight itself.\n\nKinda like eating a full pasta bake before the big track meet.\n\nThere are quite a few ways to slow stamina depletion in Monster Hunter,\n\nbut sometimes the simplest option is the best one,\n\nand in this case, the simplest option is steak.\n\nSteak is made from raw meat in Monster Hunter\n\n— and also the real world —\n\nand if you eat it, it boosts your max stamina.\n\nBut the effects change based on how you cook it.\n\nA rare steak refills your stamina bar and makes it longer,\n\nbut a well-done steak does all that AND it slows your max stamina depletion.\n\nThe steak snobs among you may turn up your nose at the assertion\n\nthat a well-done meat is better than a wet, juicy, rare one…\n\nBut I posit to you this question:\n\nWhich one would you rather have jangling around in your leather satchel?\n\nSo I’ll be cooking these meats until they are all-the-way gray.\n\nTechnique 3: Stamina Regeneration.\n\nWith this technique, every time you use stamina, you’ll get it back faster.\n\nAnd there is no game that makes you say,\n\n“come on refill come on come ON COME ON COME ON REFI-”\n\nmore than Dark Souls.\n\nIn Dark Souls you consume stamina every time you attack, block, run, parry, roll, backstep,\n\nbackstab, ripost, jump, shoot arrows, call your mom, check your bank account…\n\nAnd if you’re in the middle of a boss fight and you have run out of the stamina necessary\n\nto dodge roll or swing your big sword,\n\nwell, them’s the breaks, kid.\n\nLuckily, there are some accessories that speed up that stamina regeneration.\n\nAnd even more luckily, you can purchase legitimate versions of these items for about... 300 bucks.\n\nUh, no thank you. I can make that at home.\n\nAnd even if I did have the means to purchase these official props,\n\nthere’s still one massive problem.\n\nThe in-game items are imbued with dark, abyssal magicks\n\nthat I simply do not have the arcane wisdom to conjure.\n\nLuckily, I do have one little piece of magic I can use.\n\nIt’s called: The placebo effect!\n\nThere are plenty of psych studies that show that clothing choices\n\ncan have an effect on our mood and your confidence,\n\nand there are even more studies that show that placebos can have legitimate beneficial effects,\n\nso why wouldn’t donning The Mask of the Child help me deal with laundry chair?\n\n*More sad accordion music*\n\nAnd finally, technique 4: Permanent Increases.\n\nThis is by far the best way to maximize your stamina.\n\nWhen you’ve got all the stamina in the world, even the heaviest of tasks won’t phase you.\n\nThere are plenty of realistic games that use this technique, like Red Dead Redemption 2,\n\nwhere the only way to increase your max stamina is to do a bunch of stamina heavy tasks, like sprinting.\n\nBut the thing about this technique is that…\n\nIT SUCKS.\n\nUH, I’M SORRY?! You’re telling me that in order to have more energy,\n\nI have to use up all the little energy I have? That’s recursive logic.\n\nI don’t have any energy to begin with, and you want me to run a mile? Bullshit!\n\nSo since Rockstar doesn’t actually care about realism, let’s talk about a more grounded game:\n\nBreath of the Wild.\n\nIn this game, Link can trade four spirit orbs to increase his hearts or his stamina.\n\nBut I want to focus on this little guy, the Horned Statue.\n\nHere, you can do a different sort of trade… a devil’s bargain. You can increase your max stamina...\n\nYOU JUST HAVE TO GIVE UP SOME LIFE.\n\nThe only problem is that I can\'t figure out how I would gain more stamina\n\nby doing something physically detrimental, like using a shampoo with sulfates.\n\nI would never do that.\n\nSo for now, I’ll be focusing on the first three techniques.\n\nHere’s how the experiment will go: I will spend one day on each technique,\n\nrating my stamina level every hour of that day.\n\nIf I’m at a 0, then I’m either sleeping or dead, so most of my stamina levels will be between 1 and 10,\n\nwith a 1 being the stamina level of a hotboxed sloth,\n\nand a 10 being the energy of a 6-year-old at a laser tag party who just finished his first can of mello yello.\n\nMy goal is to be at a level 10 at all times.\n\nI’ll also be rating the boosts based on three criteria: Boost speed, Boost endurance, and Boost Quality.\n\nBut first, we have to do a control trial. Which is just a normal day.\n\n“Just after 7 o\'clock on a Monday. I\'d say my power level is at a 5. I\'m about to have some coffee."\n\nI went about my day as I normally do, which is to say, boringly.\n\nIf we take a look at this graph, you’ll see that there were two little spikes.\n\nThe first one, which happened after I had my morning coffee,\n\nand the second one after I hit a real low spot right after lunch.\n\nI have no idea if I’m pointing to the right places.\n\n“It\'s half past one. I decided to be productive by at least leaving my house.\n\nGonna go buy a liter of Monster.\n\nYou can\'t tell because I\'m wearing a mask, but I\'m grimacing under here."\n\nThis is obviously just one control trial,\n\nbut it is emblematic of the lethargy I’ve been feeling for the past few weeks.\n\nI never got above an 8, and in fact my average for the full day\n\nwas just a little bit higher than how I was feeling right after I woke up. That’s pretty bad.\n\nBut it means there\'s nowhere to go but up.\n\nAnd I’ll be going WAY UP with the first technique trial.\n\n“Feeling about a 5, not super tired, not super energetic.\n\nBut instead of making coffee, I instead will go and take a swig from my canteen,\n\nwhich I have filled up with three different Monster Energy drinks, up to the liter mark.\n\nIf I\'m at halfway through my stamina right now, I should be drinking 300 milliliters. Let\'s see if this kicks in!"\n\nAnd the effects of Sam Bridges’ favorite concoction did, indeed, kick in. "8 o\'clock!\n\nLet\'s, okay, obviously the energy drink has, uh, affected me. Let me put this down so I\n\ncan move around with my hands. I can still have more stamina. Yeah, I feel like I\'m at\n\nan 8 right now. You know normally I\'d say that that\'s fine. I\'m trying to be at the\n\npeak performance level. Another 120 milliliters down the hatch. Let\'s do some work, baby!\n\n*singing* Don\'t mind me, just gonna do some work right now. Feeling fine! Probably a 9.\n\nOr maybe a 9 and a half! Maybe a 10? Probably... I\'ll, mmm, 9 and a half. Can we get waffle\n\nfries? Does anyone deliver waffle fries? NO FILMING! Let\'s go write more scripts!" Things\n\nwere going great for me in the stamina department. Until they weren’t. *incoherent mumbling*\n\n"The crash, and then right after eating lunch has kind of... just brought the whole thing\n\ndown to a 3. Now that I have seen that Monster gives me a super high and then immediately\n\ncrashes me, I’m going to do the only thing a sane person would do, and consume more monster\n\nenergy. Let\'s go to work!” And though I went searching for that magnificent, full\n\nstamina feeling I fleetingly experienced in that morning, I still averaged less than the\n\ncontrol trial for the rest of the afternoon. I drank 3 full cans of Monster Energy.\n\n“If I hadn’t had the monster energy, would I have been dead right now? I don\'t understand.”\n\nThere was only one little spike that happened after I had to go outside to pick up steaks\n\nfor the next day’s trials, and though the energy drinks didn’t keep me up all night,\n\nthere were some other side effects, that ultimately led to a bad review of this technique. “My\n\nbody is tired, but my mind is just, there\'s some anxieties in there? And also I feel,\n\nlike, physically not great." Still I had high hopes for Trial 2. Since the previous two\n\ntrials trended downward, I had hoped that Slowing Depletion would help. Unfortunately,\n\ndue to the previous day’s trials, I was operating at a deficit. "Went to bed alright\n\nand then I woke up about 2 hours after that, and then kept waking up every 30 minutes.\n\nI\'ll tell you what, more than anything in the world, what I would love to do is go ahead\n\nand brew myself a pot of coffee, but you know what, I’ll do you one better.\n\nSuper cheap, beef eye-round steak.\n\nI’m gonna ahead and grill one of these puppies up to a healthy 160 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nLet’s get some breakfast going.”\n\nI tried my best to go into this experience unbiased, and honestly, the first steak of the day wasn’t that bad.\n\n“I feel more powerful."\n\nAnd though it didn’t give me quite the same bump as the Monster Energy,\n\nmy stamina levels rose and stayed level for the entire morning.\n\n“It feels like I\'m maintaining it a lot better.\n\nMaybe I really am not degrading my stamina. It is almost lunchtime.\n\nMaybe I\'ll eat two well-done medallions of steak."\n\nThat’s exactly what I did. Sadly, the second meats of the day were not as wonderful,\n\nand this is where the true challenge of this technique came in.\n\n“I do really wish I was eating something other than this.\n\nThe problem is that I\'m still very hungry, and... but I also don\'t want to eat any more well-done steaks.”\n\nWith my stomach rumbling and my stamina flagging, I decided to try to take my mind off it by\n\nworking on the accessories for the next day’s trials. And this did give me a little stamina boost,\n\nand that stamina maintained, but other things weren’t going so hot.\n\n“Great, stamina’s going alright, but I am so hungry,\n\nand also so upset with idea that I have to eat more of these well-done pucks of meat.\n\nBut I\'m gonna make the last two!\n\nNow a lot of you might be wondering, doesn’t it get easier over time?\n\nAnd the answer is obviously no.”\n\nBy the end of the day, it\'s easy to see that though my stamina didn\'t get quite as high,\n\nit did last longer, so there might be some truth to this slowing degradation technique.\n\nBut unlike the Monster Energy trial,\n\nthis one was both literally and metaphorically harder to swallow.\n\nThere’s a reason energy drinks aren’t chewable.\n\nLuckily, our final trial didn’t make me consume anything.\n\n“I slept a little bit better last night, at least, so I\'d say I\'m at, like, a 4.\n\nBut the goodnews is that I know just what to do. Let me go put on my accessories.\n\nI already feel energized.”\n\nOkay, full disclosure, as much as I believe video game logic,\n\nI did just tape some tin foil onto some cardboard.\n\nI wasn’t expecting much from this trial.\n\nBut the results speak for themselves.\n\n“Why don’t I carry around a shield more often!\n\nThis makes me feel so powerful!”\n\nI had a morning boost that rivaled Item Refills!\n\nSure, working in full garb was a little bit annoying,\n\nbut that didn’t stop me from being an active participant in my virtual meetings.\n\n"Yeah, I can, I can help out with that, Jenna, if you need any extra help on that one."\n\nJenna - "Yeah, Brian. I guess so."\n\nBut around 11, the mask and shield were getting to me,\n\nso I started altering which of the accessories I was wearing.\n\nThere’s no set bonus, so as long as I have one item equipped,\n\nmy stamina regeneration should be a little bit faster than normal.\n\n“For the past hour, I took off the mask, and I’ve just been living on the Chloranthy Ring.\n\nI do feel more tired. I\'m gonna rethink about the mask."\n\nAt 1:30, I had to do a stream, and I did that in the mask.\n\nAnd sure enough, my stamina was boosted after that experience.\n\nIn fact for most of the day, the accessories helped and didn’t make my stomach hurt,\n\nbut there were other costs.\n\n“I don’t like wearing this mask.\n\nI feel like my stamina has increased. But it seems like there\'s an obvious trade off going on here,\n\nbecause, like, it\'s not, it’s not comfortable to wear. You can see, like, it\'s been squishing my nose.\n\nI’m deciding whether or not I want to have higher energy levels or if I want to feel comfortable,\n\nis really what\'s happening at the moment."\n\nTake a look right there.\n\nI imagine that the Wright Brothers wore a similar expression the day they went to Kitty Hawk,\n\nbecause that is the face of a man who is ready to soar.\n\nRemember how I said I couldn’t figure out how to trade health for stamina?\n\nWell judging from these previous trials,\n\neach one of them was physically detrimental in a specific and wonderful way.\n\n"I feel, like, physically not great."\n\n"Why am I still so hungry?"\n\n"It\'s not comfortable to wear."\n\nPerhaps I could trade my health for more stamina by doing every technique at once.\n\nWelcome to The Final Trial!\n\n“Waking up this morning and realizing what I was going to have to do today\n\nreally just made me not want to get out of bed.\n\nI am about to do all three stamina things at once.\n\nI’m not expecting it to feel good, but I am expecting\n\nan increase in productivity unlike... anyone has ever seen from me.”\n\nSo after donning my outfit and grilling up a well-done steak,\n\nI sat down for breakfast.\n\n“God I hate this steak.”\n\nAnd by 9 o’clock, I felt the effects.\n\n“I think maybe god didn’t intend for us to wake up and drink an energy drink\n\nand eat a well-done steak and then wear a tin foil mask.\n\nI’m at a 5.”\n\nOkay, so the boost didn’t happen right away,\n\nbut let’s remember that some of these boosts take a while to warm up.\n\nAnd given the fact that I\'m increasing my max stamina,\n\nI should be hitting a 10, maybe an 11 or 12, by midmorning.\n\nExcept things didn’t change.\n\n“It\'s 10 o\'clock and I\'m still at a 5. What the hell?\n\nI\'m just gonna cook all the steaks, I\'m gonna drink all the energy drink, I\'m gonna wear this while I\'m doing it.\n\nI\'m just gonna do it all right now. I\'m tired of this. I\'m also physically tired."\n\nI ate four steaks.\n\nI drank all of the rest of my energy drink.\n\nI was GOING to increase my maximum stamina.\n\n“I’m ready to take on the day.”\n\n*pained moan*\n\nIt turns out that doing every single stamina boosting technique at once fills your stamina bar so full,\n\nthat the bar explodes.\n\nI felt physically ill and had to lie down for several hours.\n\nI can’t even review this boost technique because it just knocked me unconscious.\n\nBut I will say that I did rebound later that day.\n\n“So I left my house.\n\nCame out here to take a little walk while maintaining adequate social distance.\n\nI feel... I feel a WHOLE lot better.\n\nYou can\'t tell, but I\'m smiling under this."\n\nAnd this made me rethink some of my trials.\n\nMost of my afternoon boosts weren’t due to gimmicky ingestibles, they were because I took a small walk,\n\nor I did a fun craft, or I talked to my friends online.\n\nWas I doing these techniques for nothing?\n\nIs video game logic wrong?\n\nNo.\n\nI just didn\'t understand what video games were teaching me.\n\nGetting good at Dark Souls or Monster Hunter is about knowing how many swings of your big sword\n\nyou can do before you need to take a break.\n\nIt only becomes a major issue if you completely run out, and you have to spend a few seconds staggered,\n\nor spend a few hours lying in bed.\n\nMaybe the real stamina technique I need to learn is recognizing that, right now,\n\nI may not be able to do as much as I want to.\n\nBut if I focus on the little wins,\n\nI can manage my stamina, and I can manage my expectations for my stamina.\n\nSo although I may still wear the Chloranthy Ring, it will just be for the fashion.\n\nAnd today, I’m gonna take care of laundry chair.\n\nYou tell me when the camera stops rolling so I can stop folding.\n\n*SYNTH BANGER* ', ' WALUIGI.\n\nThe tall bastard man that Nintendo loves to disrespect. We know he\'s number one.\n\nBut who really is he? And where did he come from?\n\nAnd why hasn’t Nintendo given him his own game.\n\nThe cult following of Waluigi cannot be overstated. He is an icon.\n\nThe patron saint of weird content creators.\n\nBut isn’t it strange that this character so beloved by Nintendo fans\n\nseems to be completely disregarded by the company?\n\nI don’t believe that’s actually the truth.\n\nNintendo cares almost too much about their characters.\n\nThey rarely put a character into a game unless they\'re 100% sure it’s a good fit.\n\nAnd I think this is the reason why Waluigi has been sidelined:\n\nNintendo doesn’t know what Waluigi is all about.\n\nSo, Doug Bowser, I have collected every single piece of Waluigi lore into this one\n\nsimple video, and I’ll be presenting it to you, so you can finally make that Waluigi game.\n\nWahaha!\n\nThat was my first attempt, I\'ll get better.\n\nIn order to understand Waluigi perfectly,\n\nwe have to take a look at every appearance he\'s made in a Nintendo game.\n\nThey’re the only ones that count toward canon.\n\nIf you\'d like me to discuss Waluigi\'s noncanonical appearances, I can definitely do that for you, Doug,\n\nit\'ll just have to be in my off hours\n\nbecause it is DEFINITELY not safe for work.\n\nHere’s every Waluigi appearance sorted by release date.\n\nThese 63 games contain the entirety of Waluigi’s characterization.\n\nHe is playable in 50 of them, and we can split those playable games into Sports and Party Games.\n\nI combed through each of these appearances, grasping at any piece of Waluigi characterization,\n\nbut the vast majority of them treat Waluigi as a meat puppet. A space filler.\n\nAn extra body on the character select screen. And, honestly, that’s one way to see Waluigi.\n\nI hear you, Doug Bowser. Why should I care about a space filler character?\n\nWell, you already care about a space filler character.\n\nA little fella named Mario.\n\nLet’s discuss Waluigi’s counterparts to shed some light on his origin.\n\nThe original Donkey Kong was supposed to have Popeye characters, but Nintendo couldn’t get the license,\n\nso Shigeru Miyamoto created an unnamed player character as a stand in.\n\nAnd that space filler was later named Mario.\n\nPeople think that characters have to have some deep backstory in order for people\n\nto like them, but that’s NOT TRUE. People love Mario BECAUSE of his humble origins.\n\nThe same cannot be said about the rightfully despised coward boy that is Luigi.\n\nYou see, Luigi was made because they needed a player 2 in the game, so they just palette swapped Mario.\n\nThat is a character filling a space by copying another filled space.\n\nAs much as I hate to admit it, I will have to revisit Luigi later in this video,\n\nbecause he is key to developing the personality of Waluigi, and that\'s partially because of Wario.\n\nWario wasn’t made by Miyamoto. Supposedly, the team behind Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins\n\ndidn’t enjoy being forced to make a Mario game because they didn’t create the character.\n\nSo Hiroji Kiyotake created a bad Mario, someone that had all of Mario\'s evils exaggerated.\n\nAnd finally, we have Waluigi, who was created by the same character designer who worked on Golden Sun.\n\nThe guy who made Saturos and Isaac and all of these intense powerful characters\n\nused his talents to make the most intense, most powerful character.\n\nAnd he made him for a very important reason:\n\nbecause Wario didn’t have a doubles partner in Mario Tennis.\n\nIf Wario is just the evil exaggerated form of Mario, then Waluigi\'s the same for Luigi.\n\nAnd that’s really all we get from Waluigi’s first encounter.\n\nThat, and the fact that Luigi is not afraid of him.\n\n*Mario Tennis music plays*\n\n"Luigi not afraid."\n\nLuigi, the milksop who is afraid of all, is not afraid of his evil, funhouse mirror twin.\n\nThere’s something to that, but I don\'t know if I can quite grasp it without discussing all of the lore first.\n\nSo let’s switch back here.\n\nAs I mentioned before the tangent, Waluigi often plays the role of meat puppet,\n\nso not all of these games have lore that is useful to us in developing a Waluigi game.\n\nSo I’ll take them off the board.\n\nAfter cutting, we\'re left with 5 references to Waluigi, 7 party games, and 13 sports games.\n\nFrom these 25 appearances, we can take all the juicy morsels and put them into a list of Waluigi Truths.\n\nLet’s start with the references.\n\nThough Super Smash has notoriously snubbed our large purple child,\n\nthe trophies do a pretty good job of fleshing out his character.\n\nSuper Smash Bros. Melee lays out 8 Waluigi Truths in just three sentences:\n\nFour things right there: Tall. Thin. Evil looking. “Seems” to be Luigi’s rival.\n\nThat one isn’t really definitive, so we’ll keep it ambiguous.\n\nWaluigi is a mischief maker, and he takes it seriously.\n\nLuigi is exactly the same age as Waluigi, and I do not know who that reflects worse on.\n\nAlso, I love that Waluigi is connected to Wario, but no one\'s ever cared to take a closer look.\n\nAre they friends, accomplices,\n\nlovers?\n\nIt’s unclear!\n\nThe next Smash games really hammer home these truths,\n\nonly adding that he must also have a crooked mustache, a large nose, and a love of kicking.\n\nHmm.\n\n*crashing noise*\n\nThe final reference comes from Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle,\n\nwhere a large rabbid called Bwaluigi appears.\n\nThis is the closest Waluigi has ever come to appearing in a plot-based Mario game.\n\nA fucking rabbid has had more screen time than the original Waluigi.\n\nWhat can we learn from this?\n\nAs we move onto the party games, a lot of Waluigi’s lore is reiterated.\n\nThe main additions are that he is a misanthrope who loves to party.\n\nThere are two strange pieces of info in the party games.\n\nIn Mario Party 5, each pairing gets a different team name, and Mario plus Waluigi are “Psuedo Bros.”\n\nNot enemies.\n\nIt seems like Mario is okay working with Waluigi instead of Luigi.\n\nThe second weird piece of info is in Mario Party 4, where Waluigi is described with the quote:\n\n“That Waluigi\'s a serious sneak! Watch out for his Sparky Sticker..."\n\nThis quote doesn’t have any useful info for us, but the phrase “watch out for his sparky sticker”\n\nis the worst and I hate it and why’d you put it in a family friendly video game, Nintendo?\n\nFinally, we have the Sports games, where Waluigi started.\n\nMario Tennis set the tone for Waluigi with two truths.\n\nOne, that he’s highly skilled as a technique player. And two, that Luigi is not afraid of him.\n\nThis one\'s still weird to me.\n\nThese ones all have quotes that reiterate what we know about Waluigi.\n\nHe\'s hardworking and he\'s skilled, even if he cheats sometimes.\n\nWe have some metaphysical characterization in Super Mario Strikers, where the legend states\n\n“Waluigi\'s ego tends to be his biggest enemy.”\n\nIn Mario Hoops 3-on-3, his Baller Name is “The Question.”\n\nWhich I think just solidifies him as an enigma.\n\nMario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games shows that Waluigi is a great jumper,\n\nand Waluigi’s special move in Mario Super Sluggers is the Liar Ball, which is a ball that\n\nhe splits into two copies, one real and one false,\n\nwhich emphasizes his mischievousness.\n\nIn Mario Power Tennis, there is a blooper reel where Waluigi is aware that this is all a show.\n\nDoes this mean that Waluigi is able to break the fourth wall,\n\nor does it prove what I already knew,\n\nthat Waluigi is great on camera.\n\nIt\'s hot under these lights, anyone else hot in here? I\'m just gonna pop this bad boy off if that\'s okay.\n\n*crashing sound*\n\nAnd in Mario Tennis: Power Tour, Waluigi appears without Wario.\n\nTheir relationship was never clear, but it is surprising that Waluigi, who was built to be Wario’s tennis partner,\n\ncan appear in a tennis game without him.\n\nLuigi’s still there. Why can’t Waluigi exist without Luigi, save us all a headache.\n\nAnd that’s basically all of the Waluigi lore you can learn from the games. The 23 Waluigi Truths.\n\nAnd you can use them to create a Waluigi video game.\n\nAnd I could stop this video here, Doug,\n\nbut I’ll tell you what, I\'ll do you a favor.\n\nI\'ll tell you what I think the Waluigi game should look like, since I’ve done the research for ya.\n\nIf you’re gonna make a Waluigi game, you\'re gonna need to make it distinct.\n\nNintendo does a great job of tying gameplay to what makes a character special.\n\nMario’s got platformers locked. Wario has eccentric greedy microgames.\n\nLuigi...\n\nyou know what, let’s actually go through Luigi’s truths and see how it led to Luigi’s Mansion.\n\nLuigi is foolish, he\'s a coward, he\'s weak, he\'s pitiful.\n\nAnd you take these truths and you think, hmmm, what kind of setting would allow this mistake of\n\na human to really exhibit his uselessness?\n\nA haunted house!\n\nThis man has been bamboozled into comedic haunted house entrapment three times,\n\nsomething most Hollywood stooges have only been duped into once.\n\nHe’s a big dumb idiot, and I would HATE to be associated with him.\n\nBut Waluigi is Luigi’s twisted reflection, so his game will be far removed from this numpty.\n\nLet’s make it.\n\nFirst, we\'re gonna move the truths that are physical traits to the side, since they\'re baked into Waluigi.\n\nNext we have to decide on a cast of characters.\n\nHonestly, Waluigi has been sidelined for so long that this needs to be a solo mission.\n\nNow, let’s talk about the rest of these truths.\n\nIf you were to separate them out, you could probably make dozens of different games.\n\nA mischievous prank game. A, uh, game where Waluigi gets schwasty every night.\n\nAnd I’m not opposed to these games, but Waluigi contains multitudes.\n\nWhy does he turn to mischief? Why does he work so hard only to be cast aside by society?\n\nWho is this enigma of a man, whose true enemy is himself?\n\nThe Waluigi game, like the man,\n\nshould be a mystery.\n\nNintendo already has wonderful mystery games, but they’re too cute.\n\nWaluigi is raw. He\'s real. To convey the complex emotions of a complex man,\n\nwe can’t rely on traditional animation styles.\n\nThe Waluigi video game\n\nshould be Full Motion Video.\n\nDoug, I know this is a wild concept. Nintendo is not known for live action video mysteries,\n\nbut Waluigi is just the intellectual property to explore this new genre.\n\nImagine Waluigi as a hard-nosed investigator, struggling to pick apart the pieces of who he is.\n\nA man solving himself.\n\nI mean, there is the issue of casting.\n\nYou gotta find someone who’s evil looking, and has a crooked mustache,\n\nand a big nose and is great at jumping.\n\nAnd, you know, that\'s a... that\'s a hard task to find one guy who\'s got all those features, you know, I...\n\nWell now, wait a second, Doug.\n\nIf you take a look at my truths, you\'ll find that they\'re nearly the same as Waluigi\'s.\n\nI’m hard working, I’m a bit of a scamp, and though I might not be as tall and lean,\n\nthere’s enough of me that WANTS to be Waluigi that I’d devote everything to being him.\n\nI need this role, Doug.\n\nI’ve spent the past few months devising this pitch for you. No one wants this more,\n\ncares more about Waluigi than I do.\n\nI will fight Charles Martinet for this role.\n\nIs that what you want, Doug?\n\nYOU PICK THE WEAPONS.\n\nI WILL END HIS CAREER.\n\nAnd that’s why I hope you’ll consider me for Waluigi’s Currently Untitled Full Motion Video Game.\n\nBut there’s something that\'s still nagging at me.\n\nI’m sure you noticed that I didn’t address all of these Waluigi truths.\n\nWhy does every single quote state that Waluigi "thinks” he’s Luigi’s rival?\n\nYou could read this as Waluigi not being important enough for Luigi to consider him as a rival,\n\nbut why go through the trouble of putting that in EVERY SINGLE description?\n\nWhy not just make their rivalry canon?\n\nAnd the fact that Luigi is not afraid of him is mind boggling.\n\nLuigi’s personality is 90% fear and 10% being green.\n\nMario is shocked when Waluigi appears, and yet Luigi is calm,\n\nlike he somehow expected him.\n\nAnd if Waluigi thinks his biggest rival is Luigi, then how can his actual biggest enemy be his ego?\n\nDoes that make Luigi the ego to Waluigi\'s id? A-a-and if...\n\n"You can\'t have a Waluigi without a Luigi." "He splits into two copies, one real and one false."\n\n"Pseudo Bros. Not enemies." "Why can\'t Waluigi exist without Luigi?"\n\nLuigi and Waluigi are the same person.\n\n*Vesti la Giubba starts playing*\n\nIt’s so simple. Luigi is just manifesting his own repressed desires as an alternate personality,\n\na shocking twist that no one\'s ever done in media before.\n\nWaluigi is just the exaggerated form of Luigi’s deepest desires.\n\nThe want to be skilled. The want to be respected.\n\nThe want to PARTY.\n\nWaluigi is everything Luigi wishes he could be but could never be\n\nunder the famous gaze of his famous brother.\n\nWhat an amazing twist. What an amazing truth.\n\nWhat an amazing role for me as Waluigi.\n\nThink of the accolades, the game awards, the respect.\n\nAs someone who wished to be Waluigi for so many years!\n\nAs someone... who wished...\n\nIf there are two personalities, am I number one, or am I the one who is longing?\n\nOh god. I\'m not a Waluigi.\n\nI’m a Luigi.\n\nNo no no... Nonononononono!\n\n*mirror shatters*\n\n*shaver buzzes*\n\nAnd that’s just ONE potential ending to Waluigi’s Currently Untitled Full Motion Video Game.\n\nIf you’re interested in licensing the idea, Doug, feel free to reach out to my agent,\n\nand we can get filming tomorrow.\n\nOr in like… five months \'cause I am gonna have to grow the mustache back-\n\nI probably shouldn\'t have shaved it before we...\n\nYou know what, I don\'t have an agent, so just don\'t contact me.\n\nI don\'t want to play Luigi, so.\n\nPat- "Can you sob while doing it?" Brian - "Okay."\n\n*sobbing while shaving*\n\nPat - "Head back."\n\n*Brian gags and coughs* *Jenna and Pat laugh*\n\nBrian - It\'s so hard to sob while shaving because it gets in your mouth. ', ' I love the Legend of Zelda series.\n\nBut the canonical timeline doesn’t make any sense!\n\nPerhaps it would make more sense if someone tried to put every single piece of Zelda media,\n\ncanonical and noncanonical, into one timeline.\n\nSomeone should try to do that.\n\nLet’s go!\n\nLet’s start with the canonical timeline.\n\nSo we’ve got Skyward Sword at the very beginning.\n\nCreated Demise, and then he becomes Ganon later on.\n\nLink gets resurrected.\n\nIt’s Minish Cap.\n\nIt introduces Vaati.\n\nHe’s a wind sorcerer.\n\nAnd then he also shows up in Four Swords.\n\nThat comes next.\n\nAfter Four Swords, Vaati is sealed, Ganon’s back, baby!\n\nAnd it’s Ocarina of Time.\n\nSo Ocarina of Time splits into three different timelines here.\n\nIn one of them, Link decides to stay an adult, Ganondorf gets resurrected, and Link is nowhere\n\nto be found.\n\nAnd where’s Link?\n\nWhere’s Link?\n\nI’ll get to it, don’t worry, I’ll get to it.\n\nAnd then the whole world floods, and we get Wind Waker.\n\nThis one I’ll call “Adult Link.”\n\nIn this one, he decides to stay a child, the sacred realm is sealed, he’s finished his\n\nentire meaning of existence by the time he’s like 12, and so he goes and does Majora’s\n\nMask, which is also very existential.\n\nAnd then over here, Nintendo decided to make a timeline where Link loses.\n\nLink just can’t do it in this one.\n\nGanondorf does whatever the hell he wants to, and now it’s A Link to the Past.\n\nOne of my friends invited me over to watch him beat Ocarina of Time, because he was really\n\nclose to finishing it, and then I went over and then he couldn’t do it, and so then\n\nwe decided to go outside and play basketball.\n\nThis is that timeline.\n\nSo we have “Adult Link,” “Child Link,” “Basketball.”\n\nLet’s go back to “Adult Link.”\n\nAfter Wind Waker, he just goes and hangs out with pirate friends in Phantom Hourglass.\n\nWe go to Spirit Tracks.\n\nThis is on a different island, and technically there is Link and Zelda, except Link is really\n\ninto trains now.\n\nLet’s do the child one!\n\nWe go from Majora’s Mask into what is canonically called the Era of Twilight.\n\nObviously, it’s Twilight Princess next.\n\nThen it gets a little bit darker and goes into the Age of Shadow.\n\nWe do Four Swords Adventures, which is different from Four Swords.\n\nOne has Adventures in the title.\n\nHere’s some issues with canon over here in “Basketball” timeline.\n\nIn the Hyrule Historia, which came out in 2011, it states that next should be Oracle\n\nof Seasons and Oracle of Ages, but the Japanese Zelda website technically states that it goes\n\nLink to the Past, Link’s Awakening now.\n\nSo they’ve reversed those two.\n\nSo even the canonical timeline isn’t, like, super hard set-in-stone canonical, which goes\n\nto show that it sucks.\n\nHe does this thing and then he goes sailing and then he crashes and has a dream and then\n\ndies in the ocean.\n\nI’m gonna keep Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages tied together right now.\n\nA new Link, new cycle, and he goes A Link Between Worlds.\n\nAnd then it’s another existential crisis, but this is my favorite one because instead\n\nof having an existential crisis and then going to have to save the world from a moon, or\n\nhaving an existential crisis and hanging out with pirates, he just gets really into fashion\n\nin Tri Force Heroes, which is what I plan to do in my midlife crisis.\n\nIt’s The Legend of Zelda, the first one!\n\nZelda II: The Adventure of Link.\n\nThis is the same Link between these two.\n\nA cult wants to resurrect Ganon or something.\n\nWe’re at the most recent game, and the most recent in the timeline, it’s Breath of the Wild.\n\nYou might be wondering, where does Breath of the Wild fall?\n\nIn which timeline?\n\nIs it “Basketball,” is it “Child,” or is it “Adult?”\n\nWell guess what: IT’S ALL THREE.\n\nNINTENDO COULDN’T FIGURE IT OUT, SO THEY DECIDED TO JUST PUT IT IN ALL OF THE TIMELINES.\n\nWHICH ISN’T HOW TIME WORKS…\n\nTO MY KNOWLEDGE.\n\n*vague gesturing*\n\nI’m gonna make this timeline much worse, but I’m gonna also explain the convergence.\n\nSo what I’m gonna go to next is Zelda spinoff games.\n\nI’m not gonna talk about some specific things, namely cameos, or when you can buy Link’s\n\nclothing in other games, or some of the mangas because they’re just the same exact stories\n\nas some of the main canonical timeline games.\n\nI’ve wrapped all of these up.\n\nSome of them don’t have connections yet.\n\nDon’t worry, I’ll get to it.\n\nLet’s start with the easy Zelda spinoffs.\n\nThere were a lot of them during Twilight Princess.\n\nLink was also learning how to use his crossbow for big game hunting, and also it was Twilight\n\nPrincess Picross.\n\nMidna wanted to… she thought picross would help him…\n\nbeat Zant.\n\nWe’ll start from the beginning.\n\nSkyward Sword was supposed to be the first one, but they’re wrong.\n\nHylia chose her first hero, there was, like, a lot of time between the first hero and the\n\none that happened in Skyward Sword, and in that time was the Zelda Game & Watch.\n\nJust like in Skyward Sword, there was an upper level and a bottom level, and then there were\n\ndragons also in Skyward Sword.\n\nThat’s my logic behind this one.\n\nYou say “Zelda Game & Watch, what about the Zelda Game Watch?”\n\nThat’s right, the Nelsonic Zelda Game Watch.\n\nThis was a watch that you could play Zelda on, and there were only four dragons in this one.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the other Link already defeated the other ones!\n\nThere were three other dragons in Skyward Sword, and they were nice because they learned\n\nthat Link would fuck their shit up!\n\nLink: The Faces of Evil and Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon.\n\nI’m not an expert on this one because I’ve never played them.\n\nWhich I think is probably the best decision I’ve made in my life.\n\nRight over here, why?\n\nBecause in Link: The Faces of Evil he has to go to the island of Koridai.\n\nIslands?\n\nIn the great sea!\n\nObviously, that’s where they make sense to go.\n\nUh, Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon can go there, too.\n\nSQUADALA!\n\nBut that’s not the only CD-i game!\n\nThere’s also Zelda’s Adventure.\n\nGanon, I guess he stole some celestial something-or-others, and then it started the era of darkness.\n\nAnd remember what I said before about how it went to twilight and then to shadow?\n\nWhat comes after that?\n\nThat’s right it’s darkness, baby!\n\nY’all know about the Satellaview?\n\nIt was a weird thing for the SNES, or the Super Famicom because it was just in Japan.\n\nIt insisted on all of the Satellaview games including the letters BS.\n\nBS The Legend of Zelda: Kamigami no Triforce was just basically A Link to the Past, so\n\nI didn’t include it in this one.\n\nBut there are other BS Legend of Zelda games, and they’re weird because they don’t actually\n\ninclude Link.\n\nThey include these two characters that you could choose, and they technically part of\n\nthe Satellaview thing, so it wasn’t Link who was there, but… um…\n\nI’ll explain in a second.\n\nI cut one of the titles in half.\n\nClayton, we have to start over.\n\nA Link to the Past happens and then Link goes away on a journey into the water and then\n\nhe dies.\n\nWhat’s happening while Link goes on adventures is BS The Legend of Zelda.\n\nIt happens after that, during Link’s Awakening, when Link runs away, which is why those kids\n\nare the ones in this.\n\nAnd then after that it goes Link…\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Ancient Stone Tablets.\n\nAnd technically, since those kids are the ones that are in BS The Legend of Zelda, that\n\ntechnically means that they are an iteration of Link, and so BS-X: The Story of the Town\n\nWhose Name Was Stolen, which was a game that included those protagonists, but, um, didn’t\n\ninclude anything about Zelda, technically is still a Zelda game, so I included it in\n\nthis one.\n\nBarcode Battler II, you had to scan cards with a barcode and then you would have to\n\nbattle those enemies using it.\n\nA different retelling of the same story as A Link to the Past, just like looking at it\n\nfrom a different camera angle.\n\nTingle exists in actually two different timelines, and he also exists in every timeline, because\n\nTingle is, um, the perfect evolution of humanity.\n\nHe shows up in Majora’s Mask first, and he also shows up in Wind Waker.\n\nWe have an origin story for Tingle in Freshly Picked Tingle’s Rosy Rupeeland.\n\nHe starts to get the taste *mwah* I love rupees.\n\nAnd then he starts selling his maps to you in Majora’s Mask, but at the same time as\n\nRosy Rupeeland is the Dekisugi Tingle Pack, which was, uh, DSiWare, and it just basically\n\nwas like a calculator, and like a fortune teller or something.\n\nTingle’s Balloon Fight DS.\n\nThis happens at the same time as Wind Waker.\n\nOver here in “Basketball” timeline, we’ve got Ripened Tingle’s Balloon Trip of Love.\n\nI’m not gonna explain how it connects just yet, because I’ll do that later.\n\nIt’s the final Zelda spinoff.\n\nHyrule Warriors Definitive Edition, and I’m using the definitive edition because that’s\n\njust the collection of all of them, ‘cause there’s three different versions of this game.\n\nI’m gonna put Hyrule Warriors over here, and I’m gonna call this the TIME BREAK.\n\n*THE TIME BREAK*\n\nThey made three timelines already, so why can’t I make my own?\n\nHyrule Warriors is the second most important game in the entire timeline for how it ties\n\neverything together.\n\nHyrule Warriors.\n\nThink about that, Nintendo!\n\nYou made me care about Hyrule Warriors!\n\nBut we’re not done with Zelda games.\n\nWe’re gonna talk about Zelda character appearances.\n\nIf Miyamoto doesn’t, like, email me after this video goes up and say, “Brian, you’ve\n\ncracked the code!”\n\nI’m never gonna play another Zelda game ever again.\n\nThis whole goddamn suit is so tight, I feel like a Christmas ham.\n\nI haven’t connected these two right now, because in “Adult Link” timeline, Link\n\njust kinda slacks off, ‘cause he has, again, existential crisis.\n\nHe finished beating Ganon, what does he do for the rest of his life?\n\nI’ll tell you what he does: He go-karts, and he fights people…\n\nFOR SPORT.\n\nSuper Smash Bros. the original one, Mario Kart 8, and Soulcalibur II.\n\nGot nothing better to do, might as well go have fun, and you know what, I respect that,\n\nbut you did forget that Ganondorf got resurrected, and then the whole world flooded.\n\nSo that’s on your conscience.\n\nI imagine that Link still has, like, access to the Temple of Time, which is why in Super\n\nSmash Bros. Melee, it happens simultaneously in Ocarina of Time, because he can change\n\nhimself into Young Link, and also Ganondorf’s there, and I don’t know why he’s allowed\n\nto fight.\n\nI’ve put these three Super Smash Bros. after Hyrule Warriors in the TIME BREAK.\n\n*TIME BREAK*\n\nAnd while we’re hanging out in the time break…\n\nSonic’s here.\n\nSonic’s in the time break baby!\n\nI swear to god I’m not just using the time break as a catch-all, but it does work as\n\na catch-all.\n\nThere’s this weird-ass game for the Wii called Captain Rainbow.\n\nTechnically happens at the same time as Link’s Awakening because it includes Crazy Tracy,\n\nbut Link’s Awakening happens within Link’s dream, so that means that Captain Rainbow\n\nmight be happening within Crazy Tracy’s dream.\n\nSo it’s very much like Inception.\n\nAnd that means that Joseph Gordon Levitt exists in the Zelda timeline.\n\nThat’s a joke.\n\nJoseph Gordon Levitt doesn’t exist in any timeline.\n\nAnd these are also gonna come down here next to Ripened Tingle’s Balloon Trip of Love.\n\nWarioWare, all of them, and then Scribblenauts Unlimited.\n\nAnd again, I will explain that later.\n\nPhew, I’m getting too worked up about this.\n\nCanonical games, spin-offs, Zelda appearances in other games, what’s left?\n\nEvery other type of media.\n\nI swear to god if I get one “well actually…” comment.\n\nThat’s a lost cause, right?\n\nLet’s start with books.\n\nI mentioned before that Skyward Sword was not the first game and that Game & Watch was\n\nthe first game.\n\nBut it’s not the first instance of Zelda and Link.\n\nHimekawa’s Skyward Sword manga does include the origin of literally… it’s like the\n\nfirst Avatar, it’s the first Link, first Hylian chosen hero.\n\nFirst instance of Link.\n\nI really don’t know why Nintendo hasn’t included the choose-your-own-adventure books\n\nbecause they love to have things that have confusing timelines where Link could potentially\n\ndie in them, like in “Basketball” over there.\n\nThe Crystal Trap and The Shadow Prince happen canonically after the original Legend of Zelda\n\nand Zelda II.\n\nThere are, like, 11 or 12 or 18 different endings.\n\nStick with me here: you could win The Shadow Prince with high points or you could win The\n\nShadow Prince with lower points.\n\nThose are two separate timelines in my head.\n\nSo low points from The Shadow Prince, you go to the Valiant Comics, and now we’re\n\ngonna talk about TV.\n\nIf you win with high points, we go into The Legend of Zelda TV Series.\n\n“Aren’t I sweet?”\n\nAfter The Legend of Zelda TV Series, Captain N happens, and it’s weird because in this\n\none, the hero is a guy named Kevin.\n\nHe gets sucked into a television.\n\nCaptain N creates this potential option of being able to summon yourself into the game,\n\nwhich explains THESE THREE THINGS.\n\nI TOLD YOU I WOULD EXPLAIN THEM LATER!\n\nRipened Tingle’s Balloon Trip of Love starts with a dumb 35-year-old man who lives in his\n\nparents’ house and then he gets sucked into a book, and then he goes into Tingle’s land\n\nand he becomes Tingle.\n\nWarioWare shows that the Zelda games exist at the same time which is in Captain N, and\n\nalso Scribblenauts Unlimited is here, too!\n\nI haven’t necessarily figured that one out.\n\nBoard games!\n\nThere are Zelda board games, and they also deserve to be in the timeline.\n\nThe Legend of Zelda board game…\n\nThe Zelda board game happens if you die in The Crystal Trap, how does that sound?\n\nAlright?\n\nYou happy?\n\nBut what about Zelda Clue?\n\nThat’s…\n\nI guess, happens, uh, during the Super Smash Bros. time, right?\n\nBecause they’re having fun together, hanging out.\n\nZelda Chess!\n\n*exasperated look at the camera*\n\nThere’s no plotline in Zelda Chess.\n\nPut it in Ocarina of Time like everything else in this dumbass timeline.\n\nLet me double check that I’ve gotten everything…\n\nBut what about the TIME BREAK?\n\n*TIME BREAK*\n\nI told you that I would explain the time break, didn’t I?\n\nAnd I’m gonna explain it right now.\n\nWhy does no one understand the time break except for me, Brian David Gilbert?\n\nWhy am I the only scholar in time break studies?\n\nI’ll tell you why.\n\nHyrule Warriors Definitive Edition happens outside of the timeline entirely, similarly\n\nto Breath of the Wild.\n\nIt exists in all of the timelines because Ganondorf’s soul gets split into multiple\n\npieces that go into different timelines, and again, that’s in the story itself.\n\nLink figures out that there are multiple timelines in this time.\n\nAnd then he defeats the thing and he goes into existential crisis mode, just like over\n\nhere, and like over here, and like over there.\n\nBut what does he do when he knows that all of these timelines exist?\n\nHe goes and plays Super Smash Bros. with all of his friends in every single timeline.\n\nThat’s how Super Smash Bros.\n\nUltimate can exist, because it’s everyone, all the time, everywhere, and also Sonic!\n\nBut the time break still doesn’t fit in.\n\nIt’s still by itself over here, right?\n\nOkay, the time break doesn’t have a space.\n\nLink knows about every timeline, and he’s done hanging out with his friends here in\n\nthe time break, so what does he do?\n\nHe decides to settle down, get a real job.\n\nAnd what can he do better than anyone else?\n\nThat’s right, he knows every location in every timeline.\n\nI’m talking location, location, location.\n\nHE GETS HIS REAL ESTATE LICENSE.\n\nHe buys up every land, he consolidates every timeline and pushes it all into one space.\n\nHow does he do it?\n\nLEGEND OF ZELDA MONOPOLY.\n\nTHE MOST IMPORTANT LEGEND OF ZELDA GAME OF ALL TIME.\n\nTHE ONE THAT MAKES BREATH OF THE WILD MAKE SENSE.\n\nREGGIE: TAKE FUCKING NOTES.\n\nI JUST SAVED YOUR ASS WITH MONOPOLY.\n\nTHIS IS THE PIN THAT HOLDS THE ENTIRE ZELDA TIMELINE TOGETHER.\n\nYOU MADE ME USE MONOPOLY!\n\nThat’s the entire Zelda timeline, including 55 pieces\n\nof Zelda media.\n\nDon’t ask me to do this again.

 2020-06-25 16:25:33,797 - DEBUG - file after stop_words removed: ["Bowser.\n\nKing Koopa.\n\nThe authoritarian turtle with a penchant for princess-napping.\n\nHis very name strikes fear into the heart of man and mushroom alike.\n\nAnd he’s also pretty good at figure skating.\n\nBut when you focus on Bowser’s many attempts to put the Mushroom Kingdom under his rule,\n\nyou might forget that to order fuel his violent vanity projects,\n\nhe must put hundreds of henchmen into harm’s way.\n\nAnd by harm’s way, I mean in front of Mario.\n\nBut me?\n\nI never forget the troops.\n\nAnd today I’m honoring those who have put their lives on the line for a megalomaniacal turtle.\n\nToday, I’m presenting you with Bowser’s military hierarchy.\n\nI can’t go any further than that, I’m sorry.\n\n“But Brian,” I hear you ask, “Why does Bowser need a military hierarchy?”\n\nAnd folks, I hear you.\n\nI hear your questions constantly.\n\nThey come to me in my dreams like a prophet receiving visions from an angry god.\n\nBowser needs a military hierarchy because of the Geneva Conventions.\n\nY’all remember those things?\n\nThose little rules that keep you from committing war crimes?\n\nLook, I know Bowser is a bad dude, but I don’t think that Nintendo would actively create\n\na war criminal and then allow him to sit in the backseat of a go-kart with a baby.\n\nThis is thanks to how we define armed conflict.\n\nI read through the entirety of the Geneva Conventions in order to find this information,\n\nwhich turned out to be unnecessary because there is a far more succinct definition in\n\na far shorter paper.\n\nBut do I regret reading the Geneva Conventions?\n\nOf course not.\n\nKnowledge is its own reward.\n\nAnd could I really call this an Unraveled if I didn’t spend a whole day reading 224\n\npages of dense legalese for no good reason?\n\nOf course I couldn’t.\n\nOf course I couldn’t…\n\nIf Bowser wants to keep his armed conflict above board, we need to codify his aggressions.\n\nSo this means his henchmen need to follow a command structure.\n\nOne that is not at all clear cut in the games.\n\nAll we need is a list of Bowser’s troops.\n\nThat’s where this book comes in!\n\nIt’s The Super Mario Bros. Encyclopedia.\n\nThe official listing of everything you could ever want to know about the 17 games in the\n\nmain series of Super Mario Bros.\n\nThe main series are just the platformers, none of the RPGs or spin offs.\n\nBut the silver lining to this means that I can spend a different Unraveled talking about those games.\n\nBecause God has cursed me for my hubris, and my work is never finished.\n\nOf the 17 in the main series, I’m gonna cut these three games, because they don’t\n\nhave Bowser as the main antagonist.\n\nAnd I’m also gonna include Super Mario Odyssey, because that came out after this book was published.\n\nThat leaves us with 15 games and 226 enemies.\n\nI came to this number because I cut out the variants.\n\nI cut out all of the shadow versions of Mario, the minigame enemies, the enemies that are\n\njust machines, and Bowser’s fursonas.\n\nBecause those should never be exposed to the horrors of war.\n\nNow I need to figure out how to structure this hierarchy.\n\nI asked myself, is there an analogous military that is somewhat bloated, often antagonistic,\n\nand seems to be the only thing that the leadership cares about funding?\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn’t find any real life examples of this.\n\nSo I’m loosely basing it on the US military.\n\nThat means Bowser’s military **SMACK*** will be split up into branches based on which\n\nhenchmen work best together, and I’m also going to try to fit them alongside commissioned\n\nofficers and enlisted troops.\n\nThe standard command structure that’s found in most militaries.\n\nLet’s start with the heads of state: Obviously, we have Bowser up at the top, the commander in chief.\n\nHis secretary of defense is gonna be Kamek,\n\nwith Kamella standing by as the National Security Council.\n\nWe’ve also got Bowser Jr. up here, but he’s not in a military role.\n\nHe’s actually Secretary of Transportation.\n\nBut that’s just pure nepotism.\n\nThe rest of Bowser’s henchmen are going to fit into this hierarchy, and I’m just\n\ngonna say one henchman per rank, the one that epitomizes what that rank means.\n\nAnd I’m gonna list the rest of the enemies on the screen.\n\nBecause I do want to save at least a little bit of paper.\n\nUh.\n\nObviously I don’t want to save paper that much.\n\n*paper guilt*\n\nStarting with our infantry, we have our enlisted ranks with Private Goomba.\n\nThis makes sense.\n\nIt is the basic troop.\n\nMoving up a step to the corporal, we’ve got the Galoomba.\n\nIt’s more mature than the Goomba.\n\nAnd also, its name has an extra syllable and is way more fun to yell.\n\nPat: Look at this Galoomba!\n\nBrian: LOOK AT THIS GALOOMBA!\n\nChargin’ Chuck is a great pick for sergeant class, because this troop obviously enlisted\n\nright after being their high school star quarterback and moved up through the ranks quickly.\n\nAnd now that we’re up at warrant officer, the top of the enlisted ranks.\n\nWe’ve got, it’s just a tower of Goombas.\n\nKind of like the Naval Academy’s Herndon Monument, Goombas become stronger and work\n\ntogether better when they’re standing on top of one another.\n\nMoving our way up to the commissioned officers, we start out with officer cadet.\n\nAnd that’s gonna be Twirlip.\n\nIt’s got the round, soft body of a day one ROTC recruit,\n\nbut there’s ambition in those eyes.\n\nSecond lieutenant, we’ve got the Snailicorn.\n\nIt’s the natural evolution from the officer cadet, but a bit more dangerous.\n\nBy the time you’ve reached First Lieutenant, you’ve really proved your mettle and are\n\nready to show your dedication to the cause.\n\nAnd what better way to show your dedication than to be literally shot from a cannon.\n\nBy the time you reach captain, you need to have a top-down perspective.\n\nAnd that's why the Pokey's height is great for this rank.\n\nAlso, the Pokey understands how to take calculated losses in stride, like having literally all\n\nof their torso punched out from under them and still maintaining a smile.\n\nNext we have Major Squizzard, and I’m gonna gloss over him, 'cause his name makes me uncomfortable.\n\nFor lieutenant colonel, I chose Wiggler, because they're able to maintain composure and only\n\nrelease their aggression when it's absolutely necessary.\n\nBut quick shout out to Stairface Ogre, who is also a lieutenant colonel and sounds like\n\nhe could be a member of the Wu Tang Clan.\n\nNext, we have Colonel Spike.\n\nAt the colonel rank, you’re not only dealing with wartime issues, but also the internal\n\npolitics of the military,\n\nwhich is why Spike makes time to have a few rounds of tennis with the boss.\n\nA Brigadier General needs an eye for detail and a strong guiding hand.\n\nAnd that's literally all Knucklotec is.\n\nMajor Burrows really deserves the rank of major general because he has demonstrated\n\na powerful understanding of many strategies in many different battle arenas.\n\nBut more than that, he has this tender leadership quality that makes him not only respected,\n\nbut loved by his peers.\n\nAnd then above him is a fucking T-Rex.\n\nUnfortunately, even the military hierarchy is not insulated from nepotism.\n\nAnd though no one would describe Petey Piranha as capable in literally any circumstance,\n\nhis father took a bullet for Bowser back in the Korean War, so now he’s a general.\n\nAnd finally, we have our field marshall, the five-star general.\n\nObviously, this person is going to oversee every aspect of Bowser's infantry, and it\n\nhas to be filled with the most overpowered troop.\n\nSo it's Ukiki.\n\nThis shitheel of a monkey plays dumb, but he’s the Sun Tzu of Bowser’s army.\n\nListen to these quotes:\n\nAnd that is the basic structure of Bowser’s infantry, though there are also three special\n\ndivisions of infantry units that are trained to fight in different conditions.\n\nThe Lava and the Ice divisions are still found under Field Marshal Ukiki and they don't have\n\nany enlisted troops.\n\nI won't talk too much about these two, but I think they are epitomized by the Bully for\n\nthe Lava group, and the Chill Bully for the ice group, who is exactly like the Bully,\n\nexcept he'll kind of go easy on you if he can tell you're having a rough day.\n\nAnd the third special unit in the infantry is the spectral unit, or the Dry Corps, because\n\nnot even death can excuse you from service in Bowser's army.\n\nI do want to talk about the implications of this unit for a moment.\n\nSpecifically Dry Bones and Dry Bowser, whose naming conventions confuse and frighten me.\n\nWhen I die, will I become Dry Brian?\n\nIs a living Bowser...\n\nWet Bowser?\n\nWhy do Piranha Plant have bone in it?\n\nNext we have our aquatic troops.\n\nWhere can you find pleasure, search the world for treasure, learn science technology?\n\nUm.\n\nWhere can you begin to make your dreams all come true, on the land or on the sea?\n\n*SINGING* IN THE NAVY!\n\nI won’t overstay my welcome on the naval forces because we already understand what\n\neach of the ranks in the hierarchy entail.\n\nBut I did just want to point out one troop.\n\nThe Gushen.\n\nBecause its name is the Gushen.\n\nAnd I had to learn that its name was the Gushen.\n\nAnd now you need to know that it's called a Gushen as well.\n\nAnd of course, the admiral of the fleet is going to be Unagi.\n\nBecause Unagi is the most terrifying character ever rendered.\n\nGet fucked, Mr. X.\n\nNow on to the Air Force, we start with the Paragoomba at our lowest rank.\n\nAnd honestly, we're gonna skip ahead to wing commander, because most of the Air Force is\n\njust infantry but with wings attached.\n\nLakitu is our wing commander.\n\nYou might remember him as that helpful guy who picks you up in Mario Kart.\n\nBut he actually got his start in carpet bombing.\n\nAnd it might seem redundant to have Klepto as the marshal of the Air Force.\n\nBut if there's one strategy that Bowser's military understands better than anything else,\n\nit's stealing hats.\n\nAnd these are the branches of Bowser’s military.\n\nOf course, there are also Special Forces.\n\nUnits that Bowser can send in when he needs something to be done quietly and cleanly.\n\nLike when the he sent the Broodals to perform the extrajudicial killing of Professor E. Gadd.\n\nNext we've got the Bros.\n\nI'm talking the Hammer Bro, the Fire Bro, every bro in between.\n\nYou can learn more about them in the HBO series, Band of Brothers.\n\nI assume.\n\nI've never watched the show.\n\nIt’s time for the special forces called The Funny Parade!\n\nIt’s the Funny Parade!\n\nYou know about Thwomps, but did you know that there are Thwimps?\n\nAnd the Whomps have Whimps?\n\nThwimps and Thwomps and Whimps and Whomps and Grindels and Spindels and Grrrols.\n\nThere's Tox Box and Flomps and Rhomps and Bomps and Walleyes and Wallops and\n\nthey're all pretty much invincible and they will crush you without hesitation\n\nlike a cartoonish Sherman’s March to the Sea.\n\nNext, we've got the Koopalings.\n\nThey're sort of like the Seal Team 6 of Bowser's army.\n\nIggy, Larry, Lemmy, Roy, Wendy O., Ludwig Von.\n\nNotice that I did not include Morton Koopa Jr., because despite what he has written in\n\nhis memoirs, he's never actually been active duty, and he’s a valor stealing bastard.\n\nAnd the final special forces team.\n\nIt’s the Stus.\n\nStrollin’ Stu (strollin' stu).\n\nSoarin’ Stu (soarin' stu).\n\nSwipin' Stu (swipin' stu).\n\nSmolderin’ Stu (smolderin' stu).\n\n*Pat laughs offscreen.*\n\nI don’t know if they’re good at fighting\n\nbut they are good at being the best fucking characters in Mario.\n\nAnd that is every troop in Bowser’s military.\n\nExcept for these six specific ones.\n\nThey didn't really fit in the military structure.\n\nThey don't act like military.\n\nThe Koopa Troopas from Super Mario 64, they don’t even antagonize you.\n\nLike, they go about their business unless you go out of your way to attack them.\n\nSo, again, they don't even, like, feel like military.\n\nUh, they act more like civilians, to be honest.\n\n*realizing an unfortunate truth*\n\nOh my god, they’re civilians.\n\nOkay, so maybe reading the full Geneva Conventions wasn’t such an unnecessary thing after all.\n\nThere’s this thing called the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, and in\n\nArticle 8 Subsection 2, it states that grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions\n\ncount as war crimes.\n\nAnd if these Koopa Troopas are in fact not Troopas, but civilians, and Mario kills them,\n\nthen that is a direct violation of Article 8 Part 2, subsection B, 1: (i) Intentionally\n\ndirecting attacks at the civilian population...\n\nMario is a war criminal.\n\nBut that’s not the only breach, God no.\n\nSubsection A 4: Extensive destruction and appropriation of property.\n\nDestroying a brick to gain a coin.\n\nSubsection A 5, Compelling a prisoner of war... to serve in the forces of a hostile Power.\n\nWhat else could you call using Cappy to possess enemies\n\nand then forcing them to fire on their own friends?\n\nSubsection A 8, Taking of hostages.\n\nWhat was Mario doing with that penguin child?\n\nYou might think, hey, maybe Mario's just become hardened after years of onslaught\n\nby Bowser, but LOOK BACK TO MARIO’S YOUTH!\n\nI know I didn’t include Yoshi’s Island in these lists of games, but Subsection B, 21:\n\nCommitting outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment.\n\nYoshi made Burt the Bashful’s pants fall down!\n\nBut Baby Mario gave the order.\n\nHe already feels bashful!\n\nYou didn't need to pants the man!\n\nMario has committed at least 5 war crimes,\n\nand I’m not even including the child soldiers he has enlisted in the RPGs.\n\nBut luckily, I’ve already compiled an extensive PDF that I have just emailed to the Hague,\n\noutlining Mario's crimes.\n\nStill, it’s important to note that Bowser is also at fault.\n\nThe great loss of Goomba life is a tragedy, no matter which side you are on.\n\nThe true enemy is war itself.\n\nAnd to fix that, we have to turn to the only thing that’s worked in the past.\n\nSong.\n\nOne more time everyone!\n\nWe are the Toads.\n\nWe are the goombas.\n\nSo please stop jumping on each other, ya big Galoombas!\n\nWhy do we fight to take each others’ space, when there’s so mushroom to spare.\n\nWe could all have extra lives if we just share. ", ' CASTLEVANIA!\n\nOne of my favorite game series of all time.\n\nThe myriad enemies you face in Dracula’s abode are made even better knowing that they\n\ncome from real mythology and folklore.\n\nWouldn’t it be nice if there was one place you could find the FULL BESTIARY of EVERY\n\nMONSTER in Castlevania?\n\nI think that would be nice.\n\nOR AT LEAST I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE.\n\nI swear to god, the first time I started filming this video, I thought it would be an easy\n\nchange of pace.\n\nI mean, how many unique enemies could there really be in Castlevania?\n\n100?\n\n200?\n\nHow about more than 600.\n\nSo I booked 3 hours in this studio to film.\n\nAnd then we ran out of time about halfway through.\n\nSo I went out to grab some lunch, but it start to rain, so I ate a chicken sandwich drenched.\n\nThat has nothing to do with the video, I just wanted you to know my pain.\n\nSo I had to start filming all over again, this time after hours in a random meeting\n\nroom in our office building.\n\nAnd when I finished that, I had three and a half hours of footage that I was able to\n\nwhittle down into an hour long video that was very educational and extremely entertaining.\n\nJUST KIDDING.\n\nIT WAS BORING AS HELL.\n\nBut just when all hope seemed lost, I had an epiphany.\n\n“I am going to throw myself into the sea.”\n\nLuckily, before I could do that, my coworkers stopped me and convinced me that trying to\n\ncategorize all 600 Castlevania monsters was a bad idea, and instead, I could just pick the hot one.\n\nAsk yourself, why are vampires always the hot monster?\n\nIsn’t it someone else’s turn?\n\nI’m here to answer that question now that I’m filming this video for the third time.\n\nBe thankful that I’m not releasing an hour long video of me basically just lecturing\n\nyou on mythology.\n\nI mean, who knows, maybe I’ll release that video some other time.\n\nTHAT WAS A JOKE.\n\nI’M NOT GONNA DO THAT.\n\nYOU’RE GONNA HAVE TO TRUST ME.\n\nIT WAS A REALLY BAD VIDEO.\n\nSO LET’S FIND CASTLEVANIA’S MOST ELIGIBLE BACHELOR!\n\n*hot music*\n\n*lonely squeaking*\n\nLet’s cull down that list of over 600 enemies.\n\nWe’re gonna start by smooshing all of the ones with common mythologies into just one\n\nenemy, so that way we don’t have to deal with the 96 different skeletons.\n\nWe\'re also going to go ahead and cut out the evil human beings, and that includes the Belmonts that\n\nyou fight as enemies, and also all of the vampires.\n\nWe all know that Dracula is hot.\n\nWe all know that Richter Belmont is hot.\n\nI’m also going to go ahead and cut all of the enemies from Boku Dracula Kun, which was\n\njust a spinoff series, and Getsu Fuma Den enemies, which only appeared in one stage\n\nin Castlevania Harmony of Despair.\n\nAnd now it’s time to cut the animals, mythical or otherwise.\n\nLook, if they’re anthropomorphized sure, but for things like “Owl,” that’s not\n\na monster, that’s a bird.\n\nWhat about ephemera like will o’ the wisps, or inanimate objects made animate, kind of\n\nlike golems or marionettes.\n\nI went back and forth on whether or not to include these, and then I realized they creep\n\nme out, so I cut them.\n\nNow I’m going to cut out all of the gods and the god servants and the embodiments of\n\nthings like chaos and evil, because those are inherently unique.\n\nI\'m gonna cull this list a little bit more, because, let’s be honest, vampires aren’t the only monsters\n\nthat have had a taste *kiss* of that sexy limelight.\n\nWitches and warlocks, zombie, orc, treant, werewolf, mermen, gargoyle, gremlin, ghosts,\n\nMedusa, cyclops, yeti, fox archer, ogres, stained glass knight, from Young Sherlock\n\nHolmes, where he appeared as the first photorealistic CGI in any movie back in 1985.\n\nAnd finally, mummies, Brendan Fraser.\n\nWasn’t the mummy in the film, but he’s sexy enough that just by association.\n\nBut we’ve culled it down to the perfect number to figure out our sexy monster.\n\nThat’s right.\n\nWe’ve got 69 left.\n\nCan I get a WOOP?\n\nPatrick: Woo!\n\nClayton: woo.\n\nWe’ll work on it, Clayton.\n\nCriteria for what makes a sexy monster: Number one, is it replicable.\n\nI’ve already explained this, it can’t be a unique monster.\n\nAnything unique can be sexy.\n\nLook at Benedict Cumberbatch.\n\nNumber two, is it datable?\n\nCan you have a conversation with this monster?\n\nCan you bring it to Applebee’s?\n\nAnd number three, can this monster…\n\nGET IT?\n\nWe\'re gonna start with the viable ones that probably aren’t the best sex icons, like Mimic, which\n\nis kind of a veiny blob.\n\nThe Two Headed Creature.\n\nPart cyclops, part werewolf, all bad.\n\nWight, W.I.G.H.T.\n\ncomes from the old English term meaning human being.\n\nIt’s like a… just a blue zombie.\n\nNecromancers…\n\nI don’t know, they’re into weird shit.\n\nSpriggans come from Cornish faery lore, and they are described as old, wizened men with\n\nhuge childlike heads, uh, which someone’s into, I’m sure.\n\nNominon is a beast that, like, sucks the dreams out of your brains.\n\nAnd that’s not a very supportive partner.\n\nPunaguchi is just a large protruding mouth.\n\nI don’t want to know what that mouth do.\n\nThe Maneating Plant, the Wakwak Tree, and the Human Face Tree are all plants.\n\nSo if you would want to make the monster sexy, it would just… it’s just a plant.\n\nThe rug creature.\n\nUh, you never actually see what it is, it’s just always under the rug.\n\nWhich means it’s probably just like a cat.\n\nHearteater.\n\nIf you’re into bad boys.\n\nCastlevania has some of the best design in any pixel art game, except for the Towers Guardian.\n\nI don’t know what the hell this is.\n\nA ghoul isn’t necessarily a zombie, it is something that eats corpses, which is just gross.\n\nThis one’s for the sapiosexuals out there… the Brain Float.\n\nAlastor: you should be wary of anyone who builds their personality around swords.\n\nElementals are just embodiments of fire and frost.\n\nJust hard to cuddle with.\n\nThe Legend of Zeldo.\n\nIt’s just a person with scythes.\n\nThey are also known by the name “the Night Stalker,” which is a big red flag.\n\nThe Kyoma Demon hangs out in mirrors and jumps out and scares you, uh, and I don’t need\n\nanymore reason to be afraid of looking at myself in the mirror.\n\n*pensive music*\n\nMan Beast comes in two forms: twink and twunk.\n\nThey say that eye contact is important.\n\nBut maybe not this much.\n\nI do think we need a sexy skeleton, and the epitome of skeleton in this game is Yorick.\n\nYorick comes from Hamlet, the famous soliloquy “Alas, poor Yorick.”\n\nIn the Japanese version, he isn’t called Yorick, he’s called Soccer Boy.\n\nThe Imp is a mischievous sprite.\n\nAnd I was a bit worried about size differentials, but then I remembered Bee Movie, where a human\n\nwoman falls in love with a bee.\n\nJerry Seinfeld taught me that through love all things are possible.\n\nTrolls.\n\nIt’s time for someone to give them the love they deserve.\n\nThe next monster is Evil Force.\n\nAnd I want you to just go ahead and wipe away all preconceived notions.\n\nObviously, the name makes it sound bad.\n\nUh.\n\nIt also is terrible.\n\n(Pat laughs off camera).\n\nEdimmu are Mesopotamian demons that come back from the dead when they weren’t buried correctly,\n\nwhich seems like super high maintenance.\n\nThe Slaughterer apparently skips leg day.\n\nThe Arthroverta.\n\nJust a human face plastered on top of, like, an arthropod. I dunno, maybe?\n\nChon Chon, or the Bitterfly, comes from Chile.\n\nIt’s about Mapuche wizards that turn into this thing.\n\nKind of like vampires turning into bats.\n\nIt’s a neat talent.\n\n*revealing my true Chon Chon form*\n\nThe Killer Mantle.\n\nComes from an urban legend in Japan about Aka Manto, which is a spirit that lives in\n\ntoilets and then asks you if you want red or blue toilet paper.\n\nRed, they’ll stab you in the back a bunch, and blue, they’ll strangle you till you\n\nturn blue.\n\nI’m just not into toilet stuff.\n\nI mean most of these monsters are pretty okay.\n\nUm, they’re not the… they’re not like the most.\n\nSURPRISE!\n\nI LULLED YOU INTO A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY!\n\nIt’s time for a minigame I like to call, “If I were a Castlevania game... what title\n\nwould I be?”\n\nTake your birth month, and that’s the first part of the title.\n\nOF.\n\nAnd your birth date is the second part.\n\nMy title would be Castlevania: Sonata of the Eclipse.\n\nAll of these games sound the same.\n\nWe’re halfway through the viable enemies.\n\nWe’ve got 35 monsters that I think are pretty good options.\n\nWe’re gonna start with the monsters that are supposed to be sexy, so it feels kind\n\nof unfair to use them as the sexy monsters.\n\nLorelai, Lilith, and all of the succubi, Harpys, Headhunter, Arachnes, Dryads, Rusalka, and Naiads.\n\nI’m just putting these ones all around the sides.\n\nThe demons.\n\nThe ones with the horns and the wings and they’re really ripped and muscular.\n\nMothman.\n\nEveryone thinks the Mothman is pretty sexy.\n\nAlthough this Jersey Devil depiction looks just kind of like a horse with wings, uh,\n\nthe actual Jersey Devil comes from an idea of a woman who cursed her 13th child, being like,\n\n“UGH GOD I GOTTA HAVE ANOTHER BABY.”\n\nAnd then it came out and it grew like a goat’s face and wings, and I just think we need to\n\nstart thinking of New Jersey in general as sexier.\n\nAnd this might be the way to do that.\n\nThe Minotaur.\n\nYou gotta work through that labyrinth, but once you get in there and find the real Minotaur,\n\nhe might kill you.\n\nBut, he also might open up and be really lovely.\n\nThe Chupacabra is an impish little fella.\n\nFirst sighted in Puerto Rico and is known throughout lots of Latin America.\n\nHis name translates to goat sucker.\n\nDo I have to explain why...\n\nThe Fomorians are personifications of chaos and other evil ideas in Irish folklore.\n\nUm, and they\'re these goat people, uh, and they\'re ripped as hell.\n\nLizard Man.\n\nIf you don\'t know why I\'m putting this here.\n\n*COME ON*\n\nYou gotta go what my Skyrim video.\n\nBanshee comes from Irish folklore and will foretell the death of someone you know.\n\nIt\'s a bit spooky.\n\nIt\'s also super emotionally available.\n\nYou won\'t have to worry about what the Banshee is thinking.\n\nThey will tell you when they\'re upset.\n\nAnd also when your parents are gonna die.\n\nSlogra.\n\nDoesn\'t have a folklore or mythology associated with it.\n\nI got nothing for ya.\n\nIf you\'re not attracted to this, you\'re wrong.\n\nBecause the Rycuda only exists in Castlevania, it means that there\'s... very specific artwork\n\nthat you can find of it.\n\nVery modern artwork has been made about the Rycuda, which proves it can be sexy.\n\nDullahan is an Irish faery that is like a headless horseman sort of character, it\'s\n\nalso another portent of death, but can you think about all the cool Spider-Man kisses\n\nyou can do with that?\n\nThe Jiang Shi is the Qing dynasty version of a vampire.\n\nKeremet comes out when you bang on his pot a couple times.\n\nIt\'s a good face, right?\n\nI could talk to that thing for hours.\n\nThere are so many armors in Castlevania.\n\nNo one can turn down a man in uniform.\n\nOr a poltergeist in uniform.\n\nOr literally just an enchanted uniform.\n\nUGHHHHHHH MOTHER OF PEARL I forgot about goblins.\n\nEveryone forgets about goblins though, so I\'ll put \'em over here!\n\nI also forgot about Siren, that\'s another thing that\'s sexy and draws people in.\n\nHow did I skip so many of these?\n\nThe Guillotiner doesn\'t look like much, could be a problem, but it\'s time for us to bring it back.\n\nSlime.\n\nThere are already things online.\n\nThe Tsuchinoko is a Japanese cryptid that is a snake that is fatter in its middle than\n\non its head or its tail.\n\nPat (off camera): I just don\'t see why it\'s sexy.\n\nYou don\'t...\n\nPatrick, you gotta understand.\n\nIt\'s not about what you could first see, right?\n\nPat: I mean, but even after that, what do you see after that?\n\nIt has a propensity for lying and for drinking alcohol.\n\nPatrick thinks it shouldn\'t be this high on the list, but fuck Patrick.\n\nWe\'re at the top five.\n\nBut before we get there, um, I have a confession to make.\n\nI\'ve kept six monsters that don\'t even fit my criteria, but I love them so much that\n\nI think they deserve a chance.\n\nFirst up is a unique character, it\'s Nergal Meslamstea.\n\nThe reason I think he deserves a chance is because is because someone named him Nergal\n\nMeslamstea.\n\nOf course he\'s gonna be fucking evil if you name your child...\n\nWhy, what is up with people in Castlevania naming their children dumb shit?\n\nSeriously, Alucard?\n\nDracula, you can\'t just name your child your name backwards.\n\nI\'m not gonna name my son Nairb.\n\nScary Candle.\n\nIt\'s an inanimate object that is made animate, but I fucking love candles.\n\nNext two I think are pretty self explanatory: Bone Pillar.\n\nAnd if that doesn\'t make you happy, how \'bout the Bone Dragon?\n\nThis next one is a ghost, and I\'ve already explained why that one shouldn\'t be included\n\nin this, but I had to because the ghost\'s name is Duke Mirage.\n\nAnd if someone comes up to me and introduces themself to me as Duke Mirage,\n\nmy pants are already off.\n\nFinally, I know I nixed all animals.\n\nBut I really do think we should include Hyena with gun.\n\nThat hyena can GET IT.\n\nWe\'re at the top five.\n\nThe Malebranche come from Dante\'s Divine Comedy.\n\nThey\'re all unique demons that are used to help keep corrupt politicians under boiling\n\npits of tar in Hell.\n\nThey all have great names like Cagnazzo and Scarmiglione, which was translated into the\n\nEnglish version as Skull Millione, which is just a Soundcloud rapper.\n\nThey\'re already mischievous, and they hate corrupt politicians.\n\nWe can get behind that.\n\nThe Myconid is a sentient race of mushroom people.\n\nWe have anthropomorphized animalia, why not anthropomorphized fungi?\n\nWhen I was a kid, my mom thought that I had a nutritional deficit because I kept wanting\n\nto eat mushrooms so much, like I ate only mushrooms for like a whole week.\n\nThat has nothing to do with this.\n\nI know I took out all of the werewolf creatures, uh, but this one isn\'t that.\n\nThis is the Princess of Moss.\n\nThe human version is based off of\n\nPFBRRRRRRRR UHM OFF WITH THE-ERRR Let them eat cake?\n\n(Pat: Mary Antoinette) Mary Antoinette.\n\nI think we should have more moth creatures in our movies.\n\nRight?\n\nThey\'re already drawn towards the limelight.\n\nIt\'s an Ukoback.\n\nWhy is this the second sexiest monster from Castlevania?\n\nI\'ll tell you why.\n\nHe carries around a hot thing of coals in a spoon, and is also responsible not only\n\nfor fried foods, but fireworks.\n\nHELL YES.\n\nWhat a cool dude!\n\nI think Ukobacks could be real sexy, right?\n\nWhat is more sexy than feeding someone with a lovely fried dish?\n\nAnd finally, the thing that I think should be new sexy monster.\n\nThe Mandrake.\n\nOr the Alura Une.\n\nBasically, any sort of plant person.\n\nAlura Une actually comes from a 1911 book called "Alraune."\n\nIt\'s a German story.\n\nI just think that this kind of gives you a blank slate on something, sure this, this\n\nthing is born from the ground where hanged men bleed, which is spooky, and scary, but\n\nit\'s not their fault!\n\nRight?\n\nYou know, they didn\'t choose to be born.\n\nWho does choose to be born?\n\nRight?\n\nWho chooses...\n\nThe metaphors of how our family raises us, you know, the mandrake is a perfect idea of\n\nsomething that can become greater than its original circumstances.\n\n*SIGH* So there you go.\n\nThe full bestiary of the sexy monsters.\n\nAgain, couldn\'t give you the full full bestiary, because that took me way too long.\n\nAnd if you\'ll excuse me, I\'m going to go throw myself into the ocean now.\n\nI CAN\'T DO THAT.\n\nI KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE COLD BUT I DIDN\'T THINK IT WAS GOING TO BE THAT COLD.\n\nMake sure to like this video and subscribe to Polygon if you want to see more Unraveled,\n\nand go ahead and leave a comment of your new Castlevania title.\n\nMaybe that\'ll convince them to make a new game. ', ' Welcome to Unraveled Season 2!\n\nYou can tell it’s a new season because I’ve grown a mustache and cut my hair.\n\nOhoho I’m obviously just kidding.\n\nThese are both fake.\n\nI know how much it would disappoint my friends if I changed my appearance.\n\nI\'m just kidding again.\n\nI\'m not your friend, and you have no say over what I do with my body.\n\nAnd speaking of harsh realities...\n\nThe world of Dark Souls is frightening and murky.\n\nHow can you truly understand Dark Souls lore without living Dark Souls?\n\nGrinding away tirelessly in inhospitable environments, under uncharitable overlords.\n\nTo truly understand Dark Souls lore, you must first understand the desolation of…\n\nWorking at a job!\n\nHave you ever thought about the term Boss in a video game before?\n\nThose terrible enemies have the same title as the people you’ll be working for\n\nfor the rest of your life!\n\nHaha, what a silly coincidence!\n\nDark Souls is known for wildly difficult bosses that prove themselves on the battlefield,\n\nbut can they prove themselves in a more difficult setting:\n\nthe Lordran Hills Business Park and Commerce Center!\n\nIt’s across from the mall.\n\nToday, I’m ranking every Dark Souls boss based on how good they’d be as a manager.\n\nI\'m not dancing this season.\n\nWelcome to the Dark Souls Corp. onboarding seminar.\n\nNow I\'m only going to be speaking about the Dark Souls 1, 2, and 3 bosses.\n\nNo other “Soulsborne” games.\n\nI was originally thinking about putting in the Demon\'s Souls, but they actually got integrated\n\ninto the Dark Corporation in a very messy merger.\n\nAll of the managers got sacked.\n\nSo we\'re not talking about them.\n\nThat leaves us with 96 Dark Souls bosses and minibosses.\n\nAnd it leads us to the difficult part of our journey, how do we objectively answer the\n\nsubjective question: “What makes a good boss?”\n\nSo I started researching lists of “the x qualities of a good boss” on places like\n\nLinkedIn and Forbes, and then I fell down the rabbit hole of the hundreds of corporate blogs.\n\nAnd at the end of this journey, I realized... it didn\'t matter at all.\n\nWhat does matter is making a catchy, powerpointable mnemonic device.\n\nSo here are the Five Cs that make a good boss:\n\nNumber one, clear vision.\n\nCan this boss communicate their goals, give clear steps on how to achieve those goals.\n\nDoes this boss clearly hold their big old arm way up in the air before slamming it down on you?\n\nNumber two, consistent feedback.\n\nIt’s important for a boss to let you know that you’ve made a mistake, like challenging\n\nSeath the Scaleless before putting on your ring of sacrifice, you absolute fool.\n\nYou child.\n\nNumber three, cherishes employees.\n\nA good boss values employee perspectives and rewards good performance.\n\nLike when a boss decides to die when you hit it in a good way.\n\nNumber four, compassionate leadership.\n\nHonest. Trusting.\n\nWorthy of respect from their employees.\n\nThe kind of boss you could chat with at the Estus cooler.\n\nAnd the fifth and final C. Can really just go to town on a motherfucker.\n\nSlices.\n\nDices.\n\nBig old crunchers.\n\nSomeone who’s willing to do what needs to be done when the going gets tough.\n\nOr someone who reveals an abyssal dragon that they’ve been keeping under their armor this whole time.\n\nThis is our main criteria for what makes a good boss.\n\nBut for 96 bosses, it\'s gonna be hard to differentiate their management style with just these five Cs.\n\nWhich is why I’m introducing the HR index.\n\nIf they\'re over here, they get a lot of HR compliments.\n\nIf they\'re down here, they get a lot of HR complaints.\n\nLet’s be honest, some really well-loved bosses are very bad leaders, and some really good leaders\n\nare SKEEZY AS HELL.\n\nSo let\'s rank some DARK SOULS BOOOOOSSEEEEEEEEES.\n\nHere\'s our scale.\n\nWe\'re gonna start out with the neutrals.\n\nThey\'re the standard boss, so I\'m just gonna skim through them.\n\nGuardian Dragon, The Pursuer, Old Demon King, Demon of Song.\n\nIf you\'re watching this video and you see yourself exhibiting these lackluster tendencies,\n\nI want you to ask yourself: What can I do to be better than the Royal Rat Authority,\n\nwho vomits acid all over the floor multiple times a day and is still considered a pretty\n\nokay boss.\n\nAim higher.\n\nLet\'s talk about the pushovers!\n\nNow, these are like my favorite substitute teacher in high school, Mr. S,\n\nwho would go off on class-long tangents about his youth traveling the world\n\ninstead of teaching us about Lord of the Flies.\n\nI loved Mr. S.\n\nObjectively a terrible teacher, though.\n\nChampion\'s Gravetender and Gravetender Greatwolf.\n\nThis guy’s so fun!\n\nHe brought his dog into work!\n\nI love dogs!\n\nLiterally nothing\'s going to get done today.\n\nVordt of the Boreal Valley.\n\nHe runs around on all fours.\n\nHe\'s really disrupting the “walking” space.\n\nIt’s very ineffective.\n\nIron Golem.\n\nHe’s sweet, sort of bumbling, and you’ve asked him to approve your expense reports\n\nlike five times already.\n\nAava, Lud, and Zallen, the King\'s Pets.\n\nLiterally baked into the title, they\'re teacher\'s pets.\n\nThey suck up to the king.\n\nSeath the Scaleless is a real sweetheart, but he is very risk averse.\n\nAnd if you destroy his crystal, he becomes mortal, and takes it, like, really personally.\n\nThe Fume Knight.\n\nHe’s got two sides, two swords.\n\nLook, he\'s still got his old sword back when he had your job.\n\nBut eventually he is gonna get rid of that sword.\n\nHe\'s gonna be a real asshole about it.\n\nThe Lost Sinner.\n\nShe, and I quote, “eternally punishes herself for the sins of her past.”\n\nIt’s important to have a boss that recognizes their flaws, but it\'s bad if your boss locks\n\nherself in the conference room and flogs herself eternally.\n\nI booked the conference room for three, I need to get in there.\n\nCrossbreed Priscilla goes invisible at the first sign of conflict.\n\nThat\'s not showing up for the company.\n\nLorian and Lothric the princes.\n\nOne of them hangs around the other one\'s neck of the other one, who\'s actually doing all the work.\n\nWhich is the worst form of micromanaging.\n\nThe Four Kings.\n\nYou don\'t fight all four at once.\n\nYou fight one and then the rest come in slowly.\n\nWhich is kind of like every group project you had in high school.\n\nThe Carthus Sand Worm.\n\nIf you ignore them, they\'ll ignore you, and some people like that managing style.\n\nBut also if you stand on the sideline for long enough, someone else will shoot big arrows\n\ninto them and then they\'ll die.\n\nAnd that\'s a bad boss.\n\nThe Dragonslayer Armour is actually just a puppet for these big wiry dragon butterfly things.\n\nSo they\'re well-loved by the higher ups, but only because they don\'t have any ideas on their own.\n\nThe Ancient Wyvern is the epitome of pushover.\n\nBecause you can just run through his stage and then kill him with one attack at the very end.\n\nThis is perfect for the employee that likes to, you know, fuck around on Reddit all day\n\nand then send one email at five and then peace out.\n\nI don\'t know what that\'s like.\n\nI\'ve never done that.\n\nAnd finally, this is sort of a technical pushover.\n\nIt\'s the Ruin Sentinels.\n\nThey\'re kind of like a board of directors in that they all look the same and do the\n\nsame thing, which is to say not a lot.\n\nBut you gotta suck up to them if you want to get anywhere in the company.\n\nNow we\'re gonna flip to the opposite side of the scale.\n\nWe\'re gonna talk about the sketchies.\n\nThese have a powerful understanding of corporate leadership...\n\nbut everyone hates them.\n\nThe Boreal Outrider Knight is a miniboss, but like, you can tell he really wants to be a boss.\n\nNashandra tricks you into opening the Throne of Want even though she just wants it for herself.\n\nBut manipulation gets you pretty far in business.\n\nThe Burnt Ivory King only comes to fight you after you kill literally all of his knights.\n\nHe gets it done, sure, but only when he needs to.\n\nDragonrider.\n\nThis dude doesn\'t have a dragon.\n\nHis job title is obviously false.\n\nIt\'s like if I got promoted to "Guy who had an okay time in high school."\n\nBed of Chaos.\n\nActually a very effective leader, but every time you have to have\n\na "Meeting with the Bed of Chaos,"\n\nsomeone in HR gets an email.\n\nCentipede Demon.\n\nHe nasty.\n\nManus, the Father of the Abyss.\n\nAlways screaming at me.\n\nBad anger management.\n\nHigh Lord Wolnir has a lot of gold jewelry.\n\nVery ostentatious.\n\nAll of his plans sound more like schemes,\n\nBUT!\n\nHe does know the bassist for Maroon 5 and they\'ve been looking for someone with like\n\nreally good hand dexterity and he\'s noticed that you\'ve got something good so if you want...\n\nMytha, the Baneful Queen doesn\'t really have an understanding of personal boundaries.\n\nShe\'s kind of like that coworker who, instead of sending an email,\n\njust peeks their head over the cubicle wall.\n\nExcept in this case that head is severed from the body and will explode.\n\nPinwheel can summon an unlimited amount of clones.\n\nMost bosses wish they could be everywhere at once.\n\nThis one can be.\n\nSlave Knight Gael came into the company with you, was a really good friend, and then he\n\ngot promoted over you, and he\'s been a real jerk since.\n\nAldia, Scholar of the First Sin is constantly testing you, because he sees great things in you.\n\nBut dude, not everything has to be a test.\n\nThis is a Game Stop.\n\nAldrich, Devourer of Gods has a bunch of skeletons strewn about his clothes, and those are the\n\npeople he ate on his way to the top.\n\nWhich is incredibly cutthroat, but at least he’s honest about it.\n\nPontiff Sulyvahn has two swords: a profane flame and a sword of judgment.\n\nAnd he hits you with both of them.\n\nHe\'s the type of guy who sends you an NSFW link at work\n\nand then reports you for clicking on it.\n\nDragon Slayer Ornstein and Executioner Smough get shit DONE.\n\nThey are a power couple...\n\nthat isn\'t sanctioned by HR.\n\nThey didn\'t fill out the paperwork.\n\nIt makes everyone very uncomfortable.\n\nThere is a LOT of PDA.\n\nAnd it is weird.\n\nNow let\'s move on to the good category, with the Old Dragonsl...\n\nTHIS IS JUST ORNSTEIN AGAIN.\n\nTHIS DUDE JUST PUT ON A DIFFERENT SUIT AND TRIED TO GET REHIRED IN THE OGDEN BRANCH.\n\nThat\'s not gonna fly!\n\nY’all ready for the stinkers?\n\nYou thought we had some pretty bad bosses up to this point, but we haven\'t even hit\n\nthe depths of bad bossery.\n\nWe\'re about to hit the Blighttown of HR.\n\nVendrick.\n\nDude, you gotta wear more than a loincloth to work.\n\nChaos Witch Quelaag and Scorpioness Najka are nude from the waist up...\n\nand nude from the waist down.\n\nY\'all, we have leftover shirts from the softball game, can you just go into the bathroom and\n\nput one of those on, please?\n\nOld Iron King is constantly working from home and he signs all of his emails,\n\n"Sent from my hot tub."\n\nGET OUT OF THE HOT TUB!\n\nCeaseless Discharge.\n\nThe name alone tells me you should have taken a sick day.\n\nOceiros, the Consumed King is always going on about his son Ocelotte,\n\nshowing you pictures of him and his rowing team.\n\nYou KNOW that this psych major is gonna replace you as soon as he graduates Yale.\n\nAsylum Demon, Stray Demon, Demon Firesage all have a move called butt slam.\n\n*camera nods in agreement*\n\nLooking Glass Knight.\n\nReflects everyone\'s flaws back on them, doesn\'t look inward enough.\n\nCurse-rotted Greatwood.\n\nAnother dress code violation.\n\nGwyn, Lord of Cinder is kept around because he was the founder and made a lot of money\n\non Wall Street in the \'80s, but he’s hollow inside.\n\nThe Covetous Demon is always taking credit for the work that you\'re doing.\n\nAnd he steals your lunch from the fridge every day, even though I label it, DAVE.\n\nAbyss Watchers.\n\nInfighting is a very dangerous thing for a group of managers.\n\nThe Crystal Sage does a little bit of work, and then vanishes, and then does a little bit more work,\n\nand then vanishes, and then you see them on their instagram story at some beer garden.\n\nSister Friede is actually a very good boss, and should be up here, but unfortunately\n\nshe\'s the assistant to Father Ariandel\n\nwho is SO incompetent he can\'t untie a chair from his ass.\n\nAnd finally, the worst boss...\n\nThe Gaping Dragon.\n\nUnder no circumstances should you be in a work setting\n\nand described as gaping.\n\nAll that\'s left is the top right of this scale, the good bosses, but before we get there,\n\nthere are a few bosses that don\'t really fit into the standard "boss/employee" structure,\n\nor they\'re basically corporations in their own right, so we\'ll talk about them as alternatives.\n\nThe Bell and the Belfry Gargoyles only come in when someone else is hurting.\n\nSo they\'re kind of like consultants.\n\nHalflight, Spear of the Church could actually be a real-life human player.\n\nAnd pitting employees against each other is a big no-no.\n\nThe Royal Rat Vanguard is one boss rat that\'s surrounded by a horde of indistinguishable other rats,\n\nso it\'s just an episode of Undercover Boss.\n\nAfflicted Graverobber, Ancient Soldier Varg, and Cerah the Old Explorer are a trio that...\n\nlike, they\'re just high school friends that decided to get together and open a burger joint,\n\nand they\'re kind of incompetent but you love them anyway.\n\nThe Prowling Magus and Congregation is a startup because it\'s one charismatic weirdo who takes\n\ncredit for all of the hardworking people around them.\n\nWe\'ve got some unions!\n\nA good union would be the Skeleton Lords.\n\nIt\'s three lords and a bunch of minions who are recognized and working together toward\n\nthe same goal.\n\nThat\'s a good thing.\n\nA worse union is the Deacons of the Deep, where the management only comes in\n\nafter five of their employees are killed.\n\nFinally, we have the Executioner\'s Chariot, whose employees are trying to unionize,\n\nbut they keep getting trampled.\n\nAnd that leaves us with the good ones.\n\nThere are only 13 of them.\n\nThe Flexile Sentry.\n\nGreat multitasker.\n\nThe Taurus Demon gives you the tools you need to succeed, and encourages you to climb that ladder,\n\nso that way you can jump down and hit him on the head.\n\nGravelord Nito has a lot of skeleton friends.\n\nA very good delegator.\n\nThe Duke\'s Dear Freja.\n\nYeah, she\'s a big spider...\n\nbut she\'s the Duke\'s DEAR Freja!\n\nThe Duke loves her!\n\nWhen has the Duke led you astray before?\n\nCome on, man!\n\nThe Duke loves her!\n\nGive her a chance!\n\nPat (offscreen): Do it for the Duke!\n\nDo it for the Duke!\n\nSinh, the Slumbering Dragon and the Last Giant are slow, deliberate, and they keep on going\n\neven though they got a big fucking spear through \'em.\n\nElana, the Squalid Queen summons friends when things get a bit too much for her.\n\nThat’s good delegation and understanding your limits.\n\nThe Ancient Dragon doesn\'t actually fight you until you fight them, you can just have\n\na chat with this boss, and honestly, that\'s good enough sometimes.\n\nGreat Grey Wolf Sif is a big wolf with a sword.\n\nFUCK YEAH!\n\nThe Nameless King and the King of the Storm.\n\nNow, when the King of the Storm takes enough damage,\n\nthe Nameless King will put them out of their misery.\n\nAnd it\'s very sad, but it\'s also what needed to be happen.\n\nThat\'s good management.\n\nI fully expect my boss, Tara Long, to put me out of my misery when I stop being useful.\n\nThe Soul of Cinder.\n\nIf you kill him, you might become him.\n\nAnd that\'s a very clear path to promotion.\n\nIt’s not a great path to promotion, but it is a clear one.\n\nThe Throne Watcher and Defender are another power couple, but they filled out the HR paperwork.\n\nAnd they work great together!\n\nThey\'re super professional about it.\n\nThey constantly revive the other one when they die, and that\'s a good boss.\n\nAlso, relationship goals.\n\nAnd finally, the best business boss in Dark Souls...\n\nis The Rotten.\n\nBecause this company is employee owned.\n\nEvery movement is made by the collective.\n\nEveryone gets a say.\n\nNow you might think you are small, and insignificant,\n\nand also dead.\n\nBut!\n\nWhen you smash together everyone’s stinky, rotting corpse, you can move mountains together.\n\nThe best boss is you.\n\nAnd all of your dead friends.\n\nAnd in the Dark Souls Corporation, that means you need a job description.\n\nSo go ahead and use this handy chart to figure out your Dark Souls boss title.\n\nAnd that concludes our onboarding seminar.\n\nMake sure to print out your completion certificate at the end of this video\n\nso you can send it to your manager.\n\nHappy managing, and praise the sun!\n\nUnder no circumstances should you be in a work setting and described as gaping.\n\nPat (offscreen): Hey, yo, can I gape in here?\n\nBrian (offscreen, laughing): You guys mind if I gape?\n\nAnd that concludes our onboarding seminar.\n\nMake sure to celebroderadfjoisfjid.\n\n(Pat cracking up offscreen). ', ' E3.\n\nThe Electronic Entertainment Expo.\n\nWhat began as a humble video game industry trade show has blossomed into something more\n\nspectacular.\n\nMore flamboyant.\n\nMore… of whatever this is.\n\nE3 is a chance to show off new games and the theatrical chops of your executives.\n\nBecause that’s what E3 really is now.\n\nIt’s theater.\n\nIt’s like Cats the musical but with more guns and a better plot line.\n\nBut this E3 is different.\n\nA lot of companies are ditching the press conference altogether, and those companies\n\nare cowards.\n\nSony isn’t even showing up to E3 this year!\n\nAnd it’s not because they lack things to say.\n\nIt’s because they have forgotten how to say it.\n\nThe industry has lost its way.\n\nThat’s why I’ll be giving them the 10 keys to creating a perfect E3 presentation,\n\nand then I’ll be giving you the perfect E3 presentation.\n\nIt’s theatre, baby!\n\nThe first step is throwing away everything you know about public speaking, because E3\n\npresentations are a beast of their own.\n\nYou have to watch them to learn from them.\n\nYou might ask, "Brian, wouldn’t learning from old E3s keep you in the rut of old thinking,\n\nmaking the same mistakes that past business geniuses have made?"\n\nNo.\n\nAnd that brings us to the board.\n\nI have watched hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours of E3\n\npresentations and I have analyzed what makes them compelling.\n\nI’ve distilled the essence of E3 down into 10 simple keys.\n\nIf you include these 10 keys, you will create the perfect E3 presentation.\n\nAnd if you, like most people, aren’t putting on an E3 press conference, then you could\n\npotentially use these 10 keys for like a drinking game or something, I’m not saying you should\n\ndo that, I’m saying it’s y… it’s possible.\n\nYou could do that if you wanted t… it’s not…\n\nI did that, okay?\n\nYou can use these for the drinking game.\n\nThe first key: A weirdly high-budget opener.\n\nIt is essential to start the presentation with high energy, and it’s essential to\n\ndo it in such a way as to make the audience say,\n\n“Hmm yeah wow they really paid for that, huh?”\n\nSony used to be great at this, starting 2016’s E3 with an entire orchestra playing the God\n\nof War theme, and then last year they started E3 with an entire banjo player.\n\nWeird thing to spend money on.\n\nBut both of these intros still get BONUS POINTS, because they started with a live musical number.\n\nThe second key is for the presenter.\n\nThey have the unenviable task of connecting with a notoriously difficult audience.\n\nHow can they reach the fickle gamer while still maintaining business poise?\n\nBusiness Gamer Fashion.\n\nBusiness Gamer Fashion is an outfit that is professional, and yet still conveys the idea\n\nthat this person could be seen sitting on a couch for 14 hours at a time.\n\nIt says, “I’m one of you…\n\nbut I’m also way richer than you.”\n\nBut the BONUS POINTS go to the one true business gamer fashion:\n\nill-fitting blazer,\n\ndiesel jeans,\n\ngamer t-shirt.\n\nThe third key is set dressing.\n\nThis has to be theatrical, which is to say, inappropriate for a trade show.\n\nTake a look at Sony’s weird barn church.\n\nIt was like an immersive theatrical experience, but with the 10-minute scene transitions of\n\na high school production of Les Mis.\n\nBut the BONUS POINTS go to live, human set pieces, like, I don\'t know, hanging bodies\n\nfrom the ceiling that FLAIL AROUND when a character moves through them on the screen.\n\nThere’s that classic Sony magic!\n\nI want to remind people that E3 is a trade show.\n\nAnd this is kind of like if Disney held a press conference about the Avengers and then\n\nDISINTEGRATED A MAN LIVE ON STAGE.\n\nNow we’re moving into the meat and potatoes of the presentation with key number four:\n\nNumbers.\n\nVideo Games are just programs and programs are just numbers and for some reason, gamers\n\nlove it when numbers are big.\n\nA few good numbers to say are polygon count, amount of enemies on screen, RAM?\n\nMaybe?\n\nI don\'t know, who gives a shit!?\n\nHonestly, BONUS POINTS go to saying a number that\'s completely devoid of context.\n\nBecause numbers mean…\n\nINNOVATION.\n\nKey number 5.\n\nMore specifically... less specifically.\n\nI need this to be the vaguest discussion ever.\n\nI need you to make claims about how you’re doing something that’s never been done before\n\nand then not tell us what you\'re doing.\n\nHere’s a list of innovative words and phrases.\n\nIt’s the presenter’s job to say each and every one of these.\n\nBut the BONUS POINTS go to the purest form of expressing innovation.\n\nLooking up at the screen behind you, looking back at the audience, and saying…\n\n“Wow.”\n\nKey number six is the game trailer montage.\n\nYou’ve probably never heard of these games before.\n\nYou might never hear of them again, but the BONUS POINTS go to the game trailer montage\n\nthat comes at the end of the presentation, which is just showing you everything you\'ve\n\nseen so far set to an Arcade Fire soundalike.\n\nThese six keys are the foundation of a solid E3 presentation.\n\nYou hit these six, you’re in the clear.\n\nBut you haven’t achieved perfection yet.\n\nBut before we get into the final four, let’s talk about the notable absences.\n\nThese are anti-keys, things you’ll never see in an E3 presentation.\n\nI got a list of them here…\n\nOh what’s this, it’s just a single entry that says “A legitimate discussion about\n\nhow to address the crunch crisis that\'s prevalent in nearly every game studio.”\n\nWell I guess we don\'t need these anymore!\n\n*wild laughter*\n\n*frightening laughter*\n\n*pained laughter*\n\n*pain*\n\nAnd now, it\'s time for the final four keys.\n\nThese are the Truly Special Moments.\n\nThey’re hard to build in, but they turn a good presentation into a transcendent one.\n\nKey number seven: A “WHYW” game.\n\nThis is an acronym that stands for “What? Hell yeah! What!?”\n\nand it\'s used for a game that makes you go,\n\n“What?\n\nHell Yeah!\n\nWHAT!?”\n\nOften these are for games that are totally independent, but the best ones are for weird\n\nentries into beloved franchise, like the Final Fantasy XV VR Fishing Game.\n\nEven now, when someone tells me there’s a Final Fantasy XV VR Fishing Game, I go What? HELL YEAH! WHAT!?\n\nBut the BONUS POINTS... you know what, actually, no.\n\nYou only get bonus points if you make a VR fishing game for a beloved franchise.\n\nI want to watch the Doomslayer catch a bass.\n\nBut sometimes, the presenter has a WHYW moment.\n\nThat’s why key eight is heartfelt emotion.\n\nGenuine excitement about a game, joy, sadness.\n\nThis has to happen naturally.\n\nHonestly, if I’m having a rough day, I will go back and watch the video of Ubisoft developer\n\nDavide Soliani crying after Shigeru Miyamoto compliments him onstage, because that is the\n\nrealest and most joyful moment.\n\nHonestly, who wouldn’t burst out crying if Shigeru Miyamoto, the architect of many\n\nof our childhoods, complimented them?\n\nYou know, that, that tiny thing... that reminder that these people behind the games are human\n\nbeings and can be emotionally moved by the same experience that they get to share with you.\n\nWhat could be better than that?\n\nIf they farted.\n\nThat\'s why key number nine is gaffes!\n\nGaffes are INTEGRAL to E3, so much so that they\'re split into three different categories.\n\nThe first is technical.\n\nGameplay going awry.\n\nCameras cutting back too early.\n\nMics not getting shut off.\n\nThe second category is human.\n\nAwkward pauses, stiff actors, weird phrasing.\n\nThese stick in your brain forever.\n\nHonestly, it feels like they’re planned in order to be meme-able and rememberoareble.\n\nMem- and memorable.\n\nMemorable.\n\nGod, I can’t speak today…\n\nOR CAN I?\n\nTHE THIRD CATEGORY IS PLANNED GAFFES.\n\nI’m about to blow this whole thing wide open.\n\nEveryone can quote at least one E3 gaffe.\n\nEven people who don’t know who Reggie Fils Aime is have probably said “my body is ready”\n\nat least once in their life.\n\nAnd you want to know what that is?\n\nGUERRILLA MARKETING.\n\nThe only reason there are so many gaffes in E3 presentations is to MAKE YOU SHARE THE GAFFES.\n\nYOU MIGHT NOT REMEMBER THE GOOD PRESENTATIONS, BUT YOU SURE AS HELL LAUGHED AT THE MESSY ONES.\n\nTHE GAFFES ARE AN INSIDE JOB TO MAKE YOU BUY MORE VIDEO GAMES.\n\nSo honestly, I’m just gonna assume that all of these are planned from here on out\n\nin order to make you talk about them online.\n\nExcept for when Todd Howard says something that\'s weirdly horny.\n\nTodd: "You\'ll never know when you\'ll need a free hand."\n\nThat’s just Todd.\n\nBONUS POINTS for horny Todd.\n\nAnd the final key: The Big Finish.\n\nThis is a game announcement that falls purely into the fanservice bucket.\n\nIt is unimaginably amazing, incomprehensibly great, unbelievably too good to be true and\n\nhonestly, it\'s because it probably is too good to be true.\n\nThe presenter is gonna say “And one more thing,” and then they\'re gonna show a trailer\n\nthat’s probably a landscape shot, maybe some voiceover, and then just a title screen.\n\nBONUS POINTS if it literally is just a title screen.\n\nAnd then that game is probably gonna get stuck in development hell for 7 years and maybe\n\nnot get released ever.\n\nBut isn’t that what we want, as gamers?\n\nTo be disappointed?\n\nAnd those are the 10 keys to a perfect E3 presentation.\n\nFollow these and you can do no wrong.\n\nAnd if you aren’t doing an E3 presentation, again, you could potentially use them as a\n\ndrinking game.\n\nIt\'s not like I wrote up all the rules already and you can click and you can play \'em along\n\nwith us since we\'re gonna watch all the E3 presentations.\n\nAnd to prove the power of these keys, here’s my perfect E3 presentation.\n\nSony, go ahead and just plug your trailers into the placeholders I set up for you.\n\nWhat does a gamer want?\n\n(what does a gamer want, tell me what does a gamer want)\n\nWhat does a gamer need?\n\n(what does a gamer need, tell me what does a gamer need)\n\nThe games we make are powerful,\n\nnever been done before.\n\nSo let your inner gamer out, we’ll open up the door!\n\nI know you’ll love these games, because I love these games, too.\n\nAnd it feels the best when there’s an excited gamer inside you.\n\nHunter, Hunter, let me get off of the skate...\n\nJesus.\n\nHunter, get it!\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to Unraveled Games’ E3 press conference.\n\nAs a gamer myself, you can tell by the shirt, I’m so excited to share these fresh gaming\n\ninnovations with you all today.\n\nBut before we get to the fun part, let\'s talk some business.\n\nLet me put on my blazer.\n\nLet’s talk about how we’re changing the game… of games.\n\nThe new Unraveled Engine has allowed us to create experiences that are more detailed\n\nthan ever before.\n\nI\'m talking about 1,200 enemies onscreen concurrently, over 49 meganpixels of screen dissolution,\n\n62 giganbotes of RAM,\n\nand SEVEN HUNDRED and TWENTY THOUSAND…\n\nI know it sounds like science fiction, but it’s science fact.\n\nWhy don’t we highlight a few of the games that are coming out on the Unraveled Engine.\n\nWe can go to the next slide.\n\nJen?\n\nJen, we can go to the next.\n\nNext Gen!\n\nFirst up, Unraveled Research 2.\n\nFans loved the experience of creating spreadsheets about video game lore, but in this immersive\n\nsequel, you can do that with a mustache.\n\nWow.\n\nAnd that’s not all.\n\nWe have Explaining Your Job to your Relatives Simulator, the Dark Souls of simulation games.\n\nExperience the terror firsthand of trying to explain to your uncle that you work in\n\na very niche, unstable industry, but with graphics so lifelike you’ll feel like you’re\n\nliving in the world of the game.\n\nNo, Uncle Bob, I don’t make the video games, I just make videos about them.\n\nNo, they aren’t the trailers.\n\nTerrifying.\n\nAnd finally, something groundbreaking, something that seems impossible, but we did it.\n\nI hope you come along with us on this journey of...\n\nBDG Goes Fishing for the First Time\n\nin VR.\n\n*What?\n\nHell yeah!\n\nWhat!?*\n\n*Audience cheering*\n\nI\'ve got the rest of the press conference to get through, you\n\ncan quiet down, please.\n\nBut is that all we’ve got for you?\n\nNot in the slightest.\n\nNow it\'s time to show you some stuff from the company that didn\'t do the presentation,\n\nand let us do all the hard work for them.\n\nHit it.\n\n*Arcade Fire soundalike plays*\n\nWow.\n\nYou know, I, um, I\'m gonna go off script a little bit.\n\nI, uh, it just, I\'ve...\n\nIt means so much to me to be up here on this stage in front of you.\n\nIt\'s been a dream since I was a kid to be presenting something at E3, and to have you\n\nhere in the audience... to, to feel the support that you\'ve given Unraveled Games, is...\n\nHonestly, it\'s, um...\n\nI never in a million years thought that I could have-\n\nOH JESUS, HUNTER, DON\'T TRY TO...\n\nGod damnit.\n\nOkay that’s it, uh, thank you all for coming.\n\nExcept we\'ve got one more thing thing for you.\n\nWe’ve been working on something very special with some very special people.\n\nFrom the visionary minds of David Cage and Peter Molyneux, we have teamed up with publisher\n\nKonami to release an exclusive on Soulja Boy’s gaming console… you know what, I won’t\n\nbore you with the business details, I’ll just let you see the trailer.\n\nVoice over: Yeah.\n\nI think it’s time.\n\n*intense music plays*\n\n*applause*\n\nThank you all so much for coming!\n\nThank you.\n\nHave a great E3!\n\nHunter, get it!\n\n*CRASH* Ha, we\'re good.\n\nThat\'s the take though.\n\n*everyone laughing* Almost, almost broke a laptop.\n\nBut that\'s fine.\n\nWe\'re good.\n\nClayton (offscreen): Set a couple fires, it\'s okay!\n\nBrian: We, we, this is the most intense...\n\nPat: We\'re not allowed to do this show anymore. ', ' *hydraulic machine noises*\n\nFallout.\n\nThis scrappy, billion-dollar franchise takes a fun, kooky\n\nlook at planet-wide armageddon.\n\nIt\'s an alternate history, splitting off from our timeline somewhere\n\naround World War II.\n\nDespite the divergence, Fallout features some familiar real world\n\nculture and plenty of cultural innovation. There are new architectural styles that are\n\nstolen from Mad Max. And plenty of cool new fashion\n\nthat is also just ripped off from Mad Max.\n\nAnd yet, even with this cultural innovation, Fallout has one massive problem.\n\nAnd there\'s only one problem with the Fallout series right now.\n\nOther than that, the Fallout series is doing just fine.\n\nD-despite this one. It\'s just the one of them.\n\nWhy, Todd,\n\nis the music still this?\n\n*audio from three Fallout songs played simultaneously*\n\nThe same dozen songs from before the apocalypse.\n\nYou\'re telling me that humans figured out how to\n\nmake a gun that turns you into goo, and yet they haven\'t made any new music?\n\nThat’s garbage, Todd.\n\nFallout is a meditation on mutation and the ways that humanity and culture\n\nevolve to meet new challenges,\n\nand having music that stays the same the whole time is a plot hole.\n\nWar never changes. But music should.\n\nAnd today, I’m going to change it.\n\n*tech montage music playing*\n\nOoh! This is a new dance move for me.\n\nI don\'t know if I like it yet.\n\nNow, you may think that Fallout’s music is fine. It fits the aesthetic, and\n\nit adds a sense of retrofuturism.\n\nBut you’re wrong, and here’s why.\n\nThe Fallout games range in time from 2102, the year of Fallout 76, to 2287, the year of Fallout 4.\n\nThat’s a span of 185 years. Imagine for a second that our musical sensibilities hadn’t been\n\nupdated in nearly two hundred years, and the current song topping the Billboard charts\n\nwas The Alphabet Song, a song literally written about 185 years ago.\n\nActually, that kind of sounds possible. Modern times are weird.\n\nWhat I’m saying is that if 80% of humans died today, in 100 years,\n\nwe\'d still have Old Town Road, but it would have a few more remixes.\n\nDo you really think that if the world ended in 1997, our culture would linger over\n\n"Barbie Girl" and "Tubthumping"? That we would be complacent with the cultural detritus of euro-techno,\n\nmanufactured pop, and third-wave ska?\n\nNO!\n\nAnd yet it seems the people of Fallout have\n\nforgotten how to make music.\n\nFallout 76 is littered with instruments and bandstands and stages,\n\nbut by the time you get to Fallout 3, the only instrument left is a Stradivarius\n\nviolin locked in a vault surrounded by mirelurks.\n\nFallout 76 also has the highest track count,\n\nnearly twice as many as all of the other games, which implies that these tracks are being\n\nlost over time, and nothing is there to replace it.\n\nOnly two people in the entire 185-year-span\n\nof these games are making new songs. The first is a synth that makes the same bluesy style\n\nas the rest of the music.\n\nIt’s good but it’s not different.\n\nThe other is a burnout DJ who does not seem to know how to sing or play an instrument.\n\nAnd yet he still insists on playing a guitar,\n\nwhich goes to prove that even in the apocalypse, you can’t escape\n\nthe guy who will bring his guitar to your party.\n\nThank god the bombs went off before "Wonderwall."\n\nPeople need food to eat, sure, and, you know, clothes to cover their sinful\n\nbods so that makes sense that those areas have continued to flourish. But Fallout is\n\na world where people have ignored the basic human endeavor of making art.\n\nI won’t stand for that!\n\nWe need art because of its fundamental importance to human expression.\n\nSongs were made long before written language to help keep stories alive, and they\'d be added to\n\nand embellished, much like the cultural touchstone of our time,\n\nTVTropes.org.\n\nScience may improve our health and longevity, but art is what makes long life worth living.\n\nAnd that’s why I am here — to scientifically improve on this art,\n\nand synthesize a totally new genre of music that we should be hearing in the Fallout universe.\n\nThis genre should be inspired by the music landscape and culture of Fallout\'s world.\n\nAny cultural step that goes One Step Beyond current accepted standards\n\nrisks alienating its audience by being too challenging,\n\ntoo intelligent.\n\nSo let’s guide our creation by considering the 10 definitive purposes of music\n\nand how they fit into the beautiful wasteland of Todd’s mindscape.\n\nFirst, to create or control emotion.\n\nFrom the soaring, triumphant music of Jurassic Park\n\nto the ice cream truck version of "Pop Goes the Weasel,"\n\nwhich, for reasons I don’t understand, always makes me cry.\n\nEvoking emotion is the number one use for music.\n\nSo what does that mean for Fallout? Well, one thing the soundtrack does get right is the upbeat tempo\n\nof most of the songs. It cheers up the experience of playing through the wasteland.\n\nExcept for the miserable, inescapable energy of "Johnny Guitar."\n\nPlay it again, my Johnny.\n\nIn the wasteland, you need something to rev you up, keep you moving. And that\'s why this new genre\n\nwill only feature peppy songs.\n\nTwo: remembering or sharing information.\n\nThese can be simple mnemonics like Schoolhouse Rock! Or classic story ballads\n\nlike Kesha’s "TiK ToK."\n\nI actually believe these will be more important than emotions just because\n\nwritten language seems to be pretty dead in the future. It’s all on abandoned computers\n\nor in diaries safely tucked up in a skeleton\'s ribcage.\n\nUp-to-date information is transmitted verbally, and think about how much further it could go if it was sung.\n\nEven an S.O.S. signal gets more traction if it comes with a little ditty,\n\nand I learned that from Rihanna.\n\nThree: Entertainment.\n\n*cheesy music plays*\n\nFour: Jingles. In other words,\n\npropaganda.\n\nCommercial jingles are designed to make you remember brands, and political songs fit here, too.\n\nBecause what is the "Star Spangled Banner" if not America’s jingle?\n\nDespite the amount of remnant advertising for companies like Nuka-Cola and Radiation King,\n\nthe only jingles that remain in Fallout are the ones on Gene Autry’s spurs.\n\n*(I Got Spurs That) Jingle, Jangle, Jingle plays ominously*\n\nIn the song he says his spurs jingl-\n\nFallout does have a few antiquated political songs on Enclave Radio, but as Plato said:\n\n“Any musical innovation is full of danger to the whole State...\n\nwhen modes of music change, the State always changes with them.”\n\nThank you, Plato.\n\nThe transitive property means that the opposite must be true as well.\n\nFallout’s state has very much changed, and so too should the music.\n\nSo our music genre should be catchy to the point of propaganda.\n\nYou hear this song once, and you know the hook and exactly what it wants you to do.\n\nFive: To mark time rhythmically in a group, like a chain gang or rowing.\n\nAn underlying theme of Fallout is a disruption of low-wage labor systems.\n\nHalf the locations are robot warehouses or Nuka-Cola factories\n\nor the industrial goo pit where The Joker was made.\n\nIn the 2100s, commerce is no longer the main structure around\n\nwhich a human’s life is organized.\n\nSo fuck the Man, and fuck the beat he made you drum to.\n\nThe Man was beating you down, so we’re gonna focus on the up-beats.\n\nThe off-beats. Something more syncopated.\n\nThis isn\'t to say we\'re going to get overly complicated with 7/4s and 15/8 time signatures.\n\nThose time signatures only belong in math rock,\n\nwhich is to say in the garbage.\n\nWe’re taking back 4/4 from the Man and we\'re making it our own.\n\nSix: Tradition music, to mark events or occasions.\n\nThis can range from singing "Auld Lang Syne" on New Years\n\nto playing "Pop Goes the Weasel" whenever one of your pet weasels died when you were a kid.\n\nTHAT\'S WHY.\n\nThey’re just songs that usher in a specific moment, like an alarm.\n\nBut most cultures in Fallout don’t seem to use them.\n\nAt the end of the quest “A Nice Day for a Right Wedding,” there is a wedding but no wedding march.\n\nAnd in the quest “For Auld Lang Syne,” they do not play "Auld Lang Syne."\n\nWhich means there’s a real opening to be the only tradition song for every holiday in Fallout.\n\nIt may seem lame to force a tradition song, like making all of your friends call you by a nickname you gave yourself,\n\nbut if you believe that every tradition song came about naturally, you’re naive.\n\nYou think Vitamin C didn’t know that the graduation song would become a once-a-year cash cow?\n\nThat when Green Day was writing “Good Riddance” they weren’t\n\nthinking “Some sitcoms are gonna have to end someday.”\n\nTradition songs can be crafted,\n\nand our first song in this new genre will fit this bill.\n\nSeven: Ambient music or background music.\n\nA.K.A. Chill anime beats to study and relax to.\n\nNobody in Fallout is studying or relaxing. This one is a guide on what not to do in our new genre.\n\nOur genre should be present and aggressive, and when you’re listening to it, you are listening to it.\n\nEight: To create or maintain social groups.\n\nWithout labor to constrict a person’s time or movement,\n\npeople organize into social, cult-like gangs, which makes this category\n\na big one. You’ve got LARPers, the AV club, the rude boys, all of which have their own\n\ncultural standards. But there is a distinct lack of punks, which came about through a\n\nshared political consciousness expressed through music. But we can be that, we just need to\n\ninclude identity-establishing lyrics that appeal to all denizens of the Wasteland.\n\nPerhaps this genre will help unify all of the many warring factions.\n\nOr at least create a new, very cool warring faction.\n\nNumber nine: Stimulating physical movement. Dancing.\n\nThere is no dancing in Fallout! Well, there are a few sex workers in Fallout New Vegas that dance, but it kind\n\nof just looks like the dancing baby gif, so I don’t think that should count.\n\nAnd Fallout 76 hasn’t included a singular dancing emote. All they have are things like “smoking kills”\n\nand “join my polycule?”\n\nThis is probably to avoid overlapping with Fortnite, which\n\ndoes have a pretty long head start on dancing emotes. So for the sake of originality, I\n\nhad my research assistant, Google, find all of the dances that haven\'t been included in Fortnite yet.\n\nIt\'s just a Regency-era quadrille, and skanking.\n\nWe will make it work.\n\nAnd the tenth purpose of music is to use it as a crutch when you can’t think of a different way\n\nto end a video.\n\nActually, I don\'t think this one really applies to the Fallout universe,\n\nso I\'m just gonna take it off.\n\nSo with our nine definitive purposes of music, we can\n\nbegin to build our genre. And the more I’m thinking about these nine purposes, the more\n\nI\'m realizing that Fallout has the opportunity to create the perfect genre. One not tied\n\ndown to the whims of society.\n\nBut I\'m getting ahead of myself.\n\nThe current music in Fallout is overwhelmingly jazz standards and rhythm and blues,\n\nso we\'ll incorporate elements from those genres.\n\nWe’ll have heavy beats, syncopation, rhythm guitar, and honestly, any instrument\n\nthat fits in a mobile wasteland setting. So no pianos, but any marching instrument, like\n\ntrumpets and trombones. Things that stand up to roughing it and also would appeal to\n\nthe Brotherhood of Steel. Another thing these jazz standards excel at is having a powerful,\n\ncatchy melody sung by a main vocalist, but since it’s hard to maintain your safety\n\nas a loner in the wasteland, we can have a lot of backing vocalists, too.\n\nIf you can carry a gun, you can carry a tune.\n\nIn terms of topics for the songs, we\'ll keep the themes\n\nrelevant to the people of Fallout, which based on my experience seems to be freedom from\n\ntyranny, looting, and drinking so I can be stronger and carry more loot.\n\nNow, we mix together these in-fiction elements with our nine definitive purposes of music.\n\nOne: We’re gonna make people happy. Needs to be Jeep commercial music. Yeah, your wife just got\n\neaten by a yao guai, but listen to that skiffle.\n\nTwo: All of our heroes are dead. So it\'s time\n\nto make new heroes. How else are we gonna know how many beers Janice drank last week,\n\nor how far Kevin’s head went flying when a super mutant tagged him with a fire hydrant.\n\nThree:\n\nBangers only.\n\nFour: What should I do with the information about how many beers\n\nJanice drank? Tell me.\n\nThis is music for the scavenger, not the assembly line worker. There’s\n\na whole world of useful scrap out there, and this music should inspire you to get out there\n\nand pick it up!\n\nSix: The old ways are dead! And we\'ve gotta make new songs to celebrate\n\nthe new ways. There is no song for when your Swamp Itch clears up.\n\nBut there should be.\n\nSeven: Background music? NO. This is FOREGROUND MUSIC.\n\nEight: Fallout is a world divided,\n\nawaiting a messiah of music to bring them all together\n\nor at least inspire them to wear cooler clothes.\n\nNine: The music should inspire dances that are violent and rushed, just like\n\nthe world you\'re in. Yeah, your fists are used for melee, but that leaves your feet\n\nand your elbows open to fuckin\' jam!\n\nYou starting to imagine it? You starting to hear those first few notes in your head? THAT’S GOOD!\n\nWhat are we gonna call this new genre that\n\nis peppy! Informational! Good! Catchy! Pick up loot!\n\nTraditional! In your face! Punk!\n\nKicks! Energetic! Educational! Fun! Sticks in your head! Pick it up!\n\nFor your cousin Ben\'s wedding! Right there! Society.\n\n*dancing noises*\n\nSpicy! Slaps hard! Pick it up! Propaganda.\n\nArbor Day! Pick it up!\n\nFuck you, Philip Glass!\n\nPick it up! Let\'s all wear the same shoes!\n\n*repeating "DANCE!" and "PICK IT UP" over and over*\n\nPick it up!\n\n*heavy breathing*\n\nDid I just make Ska again?\n\n*Ska music starts*\n\nYou spend your life living in a vault, and your mind begins to crack.\n\nAnd when you get outside, there’s nothing to welcome you back.\n\nShe found me passed out in a rundown shack with Nuka Buzz in my hand.\n\nShe picked me up and she slapped my face, and said "Come on let’s start a band!"\n\nShe said: START THE MUSIC, Pick up loot, get off your ass!\n\nIf you don’t feel the Brotherhood of Steel, join the Brotherhood of Brass.\n\nShe said: START THE NEW, War never changes, that’s a bore!\n\nYou know we’ll eclipse the apocalypse\n\nwith a loud and brassy SKALLOUT WAR.\n\nSKALLOUT WAR!\n\nSKALLOUT WAR!\n\nSKALLOUT WAAAAAAAAR!\n\nSKALLOUT WAR!\n\nI\'ve never skanked so hard in my life. ', ' Fire Emblem!\n\nThis magnificent franchise pushes the boundaries of gaming by daring to ask the question,\n\n"What if chess made you horny?"\n\nFire Emblem is turning 30 next year, and with 16 main games and few spinoffs,\n\nit\'s safe to say that it has grown into something extraordinary.\n\nThe games are packed with deep storylines and memorable characters, like Marth.\n\nThat\'s not Marth? Marth.\n\nThat\'s- which one is Marth?\n\nMarth.\n\nThe problem with having such a prolific series is that the characters start to blend together.\n\nOne needs only to look at the Super Smash Bros. roster to see that\n\nFire Emblem characters are a bit hard to differentiate.\n\nIt\'s like trying to remember your coworkers\' names after meeting them once at a work mixer.\n\nExcept in this case, your coworkers all have swords and can only make one facial expression.\n\nBut do not worry. There is an answer to this conundrum. Because today,\n\nI\'m going to teach you how to tell apart every Fire Emblem character.\n\n*cheery synth music*\n\nMy face is just not built for this expression.\n\nFirst step in this process is to collect a list of the characters.\n\nTurns out, even after trimming the nonplayable ones and the ones from the Tokyo Mirage Sessions,\n\nthere are nearly 600 Fire Emblem characters.\n\nI cannot explain that many characters.\n\nI have made that mistake before.\n\n"Trying to categorize all 600 Castlevania monsters was a bad idea."\n\nBut the beauty of making mistakes is that you can learn from them. And I now know understand\n\nthat explaining 600 discrete characters wouldn\'t actually be helpful.\n\nHuman beings aren\'t meant to remember 600 people perfectly. If you don\'t believe me,\n\njust try to remember something about every single person in your contact list.\n\nI have a contact for someone name Zain.\n\nAnd in the company, it just says "Bocce Ball."\n\nWho the fuck is this?\n\nBut unlike my contact list, Fire Emblem\'s have plotlines.\n\nAnd in my experience playing these games, I noticed\n\nthat a lot of these different characters fit similar roles in their respective games.\n\nAnd I\'m not the only one who\'s noticed this. On the Fire Emblem wiki, there is a whole list\n\nof archetypes based on different characters.\n\nA list that I only found after spending whole day trying to categorize them on my own.\n\nAnd it\'s just so fun to realize that you\'ve wasted a whole day of work.\n\nBut this list intrigued me.\n\nStock characters in similar circumstances playing again and again in different stories.\n\nDoes that remind you of anything?\n\nOf course it does!\n\nIt reminds you of the commedia dell\'arte,\n\nbecause it reminds me of the commedia dell\'arte.\n\nAnd it\'s so obviously the commedia dell\'arte that I don\'t need to explain it.\n\nBut I will for the sake of extending this video.\n\nThe commedia dell\'arte was an Italian form of theater that was big in the 16th to 18th centuries,\n\nand it relied on stock characters wearing masks or costumes to designate who they were.\n\nThat way the audience could be like,\n\n"Ah, that dude\'s wearing a tight fitting suit with a bunch of weird patches, that must\n\nbe Arlecchino, the servant clown — sometimes to two masters!"\n\nThis brought the audience in immediately. They knew what that character was about without any exposition.\n\nIn the same way, Fire Emblem has dozens of recurring characters that get you through each game.\n\nAnd this is how we\'re going to tell them apart. By defining their archetypes.\n\nFire Emblem goes one step further.\n\nBecause these characters can not only serve the same story purpose,\n\nbut they can have a similar role in the gameplay.\n\nAnd this goes to prove my theory\n\nthat Fire Emblem is not only the spiritual successor to commedia dell\'arte,\n\nit is its natural evolution.\n\nAn elevated form I call...\n\nTHE COMMEDIA DELL\'ANIME.\n\nThe newer, more perfect form of theater.\n\nWe just have to boil down the Fire Emblem personnel into\n\n*kiss*\n\nsyrupy stock characters.\n\nLet\'s begin with the archetypes that are standard.\n\nCain and Abel are battle bros. They fight together, but not in the biblical sense.\n\nBord and Cords are similar except they\'re usually axe fighters.\n\nPegasus sisters are a trio of flying horses ladies.\n\nYou can\'t split these archetypes up into their solo characters because their bond is what defines them.\n\nYou can\'t have a Waluigi without a Luigi.\n\nAnd in the same way, you can\'t have a Bord without a Cord.\n\nWhich is my favorite Dr. Seuss book.\n\nJagens are mentors that are strong in the beginning and then you\'ll quickly outpace them, and it\'s kind of sad.\n\nLike the first time you beat your dad in a basketball game.\n\nOifeys are similar to Jagens,\n\nexcept they\'ll keep dunking on you till you\'re dead.\n\nWendells but for magic.\n\nGotohs are mentors but only the last half of the game.\n\nBeowolfs are mercenaries that you have to pay actual in-game currency\n\nto recruit, and Ogmas are mercenaries that usually decide to join you out of their own volition.\n\nWhich is, by definition, not a mercenary.\n\nNavarres are silent, moody sword swingers.\n\nKind of like if that person who said they studied the blade actually studied the blade.\n\nThere are also a bunch of villains but for different reasons. Power. Ambition. Loyalty.\n\nWyvern riding, I guess.\n\nAnd getting possessed, which is a classic mistake.\n\nSome archetypes are based on their gameplay requirements.\n\nVery difficult to recruit.\n\nUsually recruited after they\'ve been kidnapped.\n\nLate game recruits that could be good, but you have to work hard.\n\nSuper low level villagers that could also be good.\n\nAnd if you recruit one of these pairs,\n\nyou can\'t get the other.\n\nKind of like if two of your friends start dating and then have a really messy breakup.\n\nCorneliuses are usually the parental figure to the main character,\n\nand they have this nasty habit of getting axed super early on in the game.\n\nIt\'s kind of like Fire Emblem doesn\'t know how to make interesting characters without making them\n\nsuffer traumatic parental death.\n\nTacticians. Young female mages. Young female healers.\n\nYoung male mages.\n\nThieves.\n\nJeorges do that thing where they pretend to be not important\n\nand then SURPRISE, I wasn\'t an old crone, I was a magical witch the whole time!\n\nExcept they\'re not very good at hiding the fact that they\'re important.\n\nAnd the creepy version of the Jeorges:\n\nThe Tikis.\n\nUsually they take the form of a small girl or adolescent, except\n\nthey\'re really 400 years old and a god or a dragon.\n\nAnd I honestly do not have the time to unpack this bullshit.\n\nThese 29 archetypes are useful, but they only cover 229 characters.\n\nThere are still 367 to go. If we keep this up, we\'re going to end up with 75 archetypes.\n\nThe commedia dell\'arte only has about 17.\n\nSo before we move on, let\'s combine some.\n\nThese six are all mentors to varying degrees of usefulness.\n\nThese are all defined by their villainy and only some of them become playable.\n\nWelcome to Cain Siblings Incorporated, where we all have a sibling like bond and do the same job.\n\nThese all have very specific requirements for recruiting.\n\nThese both do that thing where they don\'t seem important and then Surprise!\n\nI\'m important!\n\nThese are all hard to make good but they\'re worth it if you put the effort in.\n\nThese are all precocious little magic babies.\n\nAnd that leaves the Navarres unconnected,\n\nbut that\'s because I\'m changing the archetype to Spicy Swords. Because we can include so\n\nmany other characters if we just expand the definitions to any swordweilder\n\nwho\'s a little spicy.\n\nIn fact, by combining these other archetypes, there are now tons of other characters who\n\nfit into these expanded definitions.\n\nWe are left with 288 characters to categorize. But before I get there,\n\nI just want to commend Fire Emblem for have 596 playable characters\n\nand only repeating three names.\n\nWhen I was hired for my first job at a climbing gym,\n\nI was one of five employees named Brian, and it was a small gym.\n\nBut I guess it\'s pretty easy to cut out repetitions when you use dope-ass names like Skrimir.\n\nDagdar.\n\nSleuf.\n\nFjorm.\n\nBelf.\n\nI could go on all day.\n\nBut I won\'t. Because it\'s time to get the rest of the archetypes on the wall.\n\n*charging noise*\n\nThat took like 30 minutes. But let\'s begin.\n\nThe honorable knight, like Fiona, who cares passionately about her people,\n\nand will always oppose cruelty to civilians.\n\nWhich is way better than the loyal knight, like Troude, who only is loyal\n\nto Perne, and will do literally anything for him even though Perne is a bad dude.\n\nBut I\'ll get to that later.\n\nThese four archetypes are calm and aloof, and the only thing that differentiates them\n\nis how much you would want to invite them to your birthday party.\n\nI\'m just gonna get the blank slate archetype out of the way now,\n\nbecause Fire Emblem is a game with permadeath,\n\nand so sometimes you just need more meat for the grinder, you know?\n\nSimilar to the blank slate is the protagonist,\n\nwhich is always relatively heroic, but since they\'re a conduit for the player, they\'re all pretty vague.\n\nI realize that by smooshing them all together into one category,\n\nI\'ve made the majority of the Fire Emblem roster in Super Smash indistinguishable.\n\nBut that\'s not my fault!\n\nSuper Smash should\'ve included more magic babies!\n\nArrogants, hotheads, and edgelords all have a mean side,\n\nbut arrogants like Vaike just think they\'re the best.\n\nHotheads like Caspar want to fight anything that moves.\n\nAnd edgelords like Niles retweet Joker accounts unironically.\n\nA lot of these characters have rough childhoods but then turn out cheerful despite that.\n\nAnd then there\'s the inferiority complex archetype, which I could have just called\n\n"The majority of children in Fire Emblem: Fates."\n\nPerfectionists, mischief makers, and flirts are all highly motivated.\n\nBut Subaki is motivated to meet high expectations.\n\nClaude is motivated to make intricate schemes.\n\nAnd Sylvain is motivated to be a fuccboi.\n\nBuzzkills are just characters that aren\'t very fun to talk to.\n\nAnd Fire Emblem, I will never forgive you for naming an unemotional, uber religious, deadbeat dad Gilbert.\n\nIt also doesn\'t help that I look like Hanneman Lite.\n\nOh god, am I a buzzkill?\n\nA lot of these archetypes are based around one singular personality trait.\n\nScarlet\'s straightforward. Valbar\'s chill.\n\nLinhardt\'s lazy. Sumia\'s clumsy. Petra\'s a sweetie.\n\nAnd Ranulf is a furry.\n\nDramatic, painter, and fashionable are defined by their love of the arts\n\nand how much it sucks that they gotta be a soldier instead.\n\nSome archetypes upset the status quo by defying gender norms\n\nor by calling out the noble class, and that\'s why they\'re comrades.\n\nChild soldier.\n\nKarin is canonically 14 years old.\n\nWhoopsie!\n\nBut even if they aren\'t a child, they could still be naive.\n\nWhich brings around the overprotective archetype,\n\nwhich is just essentially helicopter parents.\n\nManuela is constantly drinking and flirting and just being a hot mess and I love her for it.\n\nAnd that makes her the president of vices.\n\nThe vice president.\n\nBut be careful not to do that around someone like Astram, who is constantly accusing people of treason\n\nfor no good reason.\n\nThere\'s a lot of characters in the meek murderer archetype\n\nbecause Fire Emblem loves to make characters that are quiet and shy and really self conscious,\n\nand then can WRECK SHOP on the battlefield.\n\nHere\'s an archetype I call "what the fuck" and it\'s the three characters that make me say,\n\n"What the fuck, Fire Emblem?"\n\nPeople like Perne, who is said to be a sweet Robin Hood type,\n\nexcept he does kidnap a young girl and keeps her as his slave.\n\nOr Tharja, who practices curses on her own daughter.\n\nOr Roger, who is act- he\'s not actually that bad.\n\nBut Fire Emblem does go out of their way to make his endscreen say that he never gets a date\n\nand he stays single for the rest of his life.\n\nAnd it\'s like, what the fuck, Fire Emblem? You didn\'t have to do him dirty like that.\n\nThe next archetype is called "actually pretty interesting." These characters are three dimensional\n\nand well-developed. People like Libra, who struggles with his faith and has incredible\n\nself doubt even though he\'s doing all he can to help those around him. Or Rhys, who dreams\n\nof being a swordfighter, but his weak constitution won\'t allow him to become one. And so he helps\n\nin the ways he can, but his whole story is one of unfulfilled dreams.\n\nAnd that\'s it.\n\nThose are the only two interesting characters in Fire Emblem.\n\nUntil we get to Raphael.\n\nMy sweet, bulky boy who only cares about eating and training and not about studying.\n\nThe thing is, the Fire Emblem world has moved past himbos and bimbos.\n\nWelcome to the age of thembos.\n\nThere. 45 archetypes to help you differentiate the 596 Fire Emblem characters.\n\nIf you\'re a GOSH DANG ROCKET SCIENTIST!\n\n45 is still too much! We can combine these.\n\nWe\'ll take these six and combine them to create a new archetype that is as important as it is bland.\n\nThese three can be more succinctly summarized in a category called\n\n"Holy shit, why are you a soldier?"\n\nLet\'s just go ahead and cordon off all of the assholes.\n\nAnd now we can take these straight-talking suck ups and call them teacher\'s pets.\n\nShhhh.\n\nThese three archetypes all have tough exteriors to break through.\n\nThese three archetypes really explore familial bonds,\n\nwhich is a RARE CONDITION, IN THIS DAY-\n\nWhether it\'s a good or bad reaction doesn\'t matter to this group, they just want to be seen.\n\nThey\'re just too nice for all this!\n\nThese four archetypes will always be subverting expectations.\n\nIt\'s fairly surprising that these three archetypes were let in.\n\nChill dudes? Gambling? A bunch of hunks?\n\nDamn if these aren\'t fun to hang out with.\n\nAll three of these are going to time out, \'cause they need to calm it down.\n\nAnd there we go.\n\nThe 13 archetypes that make it possible to differentiate the Fire Emblem characters.\n\nJust 13 of them.\n\nThat\'s fewer than the commedia dell\'arte.\n\nIt\'s only 13.\n\nWhich is not only an unlucky number,\n\nbut it is TOO LARGE for your TINY CHILD BRAINS.\n\nWe can make it better! We can combine more! WE CAN PERFECT THIS!\n\nGranted, it\'s a little bit harder to combine these archetypes, but just off the bat, we can take\n\n"look at me baby" and "making waves" and just combine it into one thing, trendsetters.\n\nAnd the "necessary but boring" and the "asshole crew" and the "teacher\'s pets" and the "calm it downs,"\n\nthey all fill me with a sense of UGH.\n\nAnd obviously the "too nice for this" and the "lied on your resume" and the "holy shit why are you a soldiers"\n\nare all just a bad choice for a war!\n\nAnd that just leaves us with the characters that are hard to break\n\nthe ice with, and uh, the ones that got family issues, and the quiet ones, and the ones that\n\nare fun to hang out with!\n\nUh.\n\nAnd that just sounds like a pretty run-of-the-mill\n\nawkward family reunion.\n\nAnd when you think about it, these ones are just strange characters that\n\nhave, uh, that are good at fighting.\n\nI mean if you include Dmitri in this, he has an eye patch!\n\nOkay, which is similar to these ones.\n\nSeteth and Byleth have the, they rhyme.\n\nUh we also, I mean.\n\nDorothea wears a hat until she grows out of the hat.\n\nThink about that!\n\nDon\'t even get me started on Oboro.\n\nI don\'t know who that is.\n\nIs it pronounced "dice" or "deesay?"\n\nAnd we can have a category called\n\n"anime character with a singular personality trait and a penchant for violence"\n\nand that\'s just the one category!\n\nWhich PROVES that the Fire Emblem characters are all essentially the same,\n\nand that you cannot differentiate them.\n\nMission complete!\n\nWhat was this Unraveled about again?\n\n...Sometimes to two masters!\n\nPatrick: Now Italian.\n\n(Brian in a shitty Italian accent) Ah! That guy is...\n\noh god I don\'t know if I can.\n\nAh that dudes wearing a tight fitting suit with a buncha weird patches it\n\nmust be Arlecchino the servant clown sometimesa to two masters!\n\n(Pat and Jenna offscreen laughing)\n\nBrian: Ah I don\'t know if... Okay.\n\nPat: We don\'t have to use it but we need to record it. ', ' Should auld acquaintance be forgot.\n\nAnd\n\nall\n\nthat\n\nJAZZ.\n\nTHAT’S RIGHT FRIENDS it’s Game of the Year season!\n\nWhich means it\'s time for us to hop on those message boards, chat about our favorite games,\n\nand tear out each other’s throats when someone expresses an opinion\n\nthat is slightly different from our own.\n\nBy this point, pretty much every gaming publication has announced their Game of the Year...\n\nuhh...\n\nwhich means that I\'m a bit late.\n\nAnything that I say is just a drop in the ocean of discourse.\n\nNo one wants to hear my opinion.\n\nWHICH IS WHY I AM NOT EXPRESSING AN OPINION.\n\nI AM STATING A FACT.\n\nThat’s right, I have devised a statistical, analytical, number-crunching formula\n\nthat will SCIENTIFICALLY PROVE\n\nTHE GAME OF THE YEAR.\n\n*hype 80s music plays*\n\nThey said it couldn’t be done.\n\nA bias-free formula to calculate the game of the year?\n\nThat\'s a fool’s errand, Brian!\n\nYou are a fool!\n\nThey called me a fool!\n\nBut do I look like a fool to you?\n\nI’ve done it, and with the knowledge I have found, I can go ahead and assuage any arguments\n\nyou might have with your friends.\n\nThere is nothing to debate anymore, there is only the truth, that the best game of the year is...\n\nhidden somewhere, um, in these spreadsheets.\n\nI\'m gonna be honest with you, I haven’t...\n\nthere are a lot of numbers.\n\nAnd I haven\'t had the time to, uh, do them all just yet.\n\nBut it’s only December 14th.\n\nThis video is set to go up on the 30th, which means I still have two weeks for new games\n\nto come in before I can really call which game is the game of the year.\n\nBut I\'ve at least finished the formula, and I’ve tested it on a few to make sure it\n\nruns correctly.\n\nAnd everyone knows that you can’t get full credit unless you show your work.\n\nSo let me show you how I made it.\n\nFirst thing you gotta do when you\'re making a GOTY formula is find your list of games.\n\nAnd obviously we\'re going to have to choose every single game that was released this year\n\nin order for us to say that it is scientifically accurate.\n\nSo if we just go ahead and take a look at Steam and see how many were released since\n\nJanuary 1st 20-hmm.\n\nThat\'s over 15,000.\n\nYou can\'t make me do that, legally.\n\nThat\'s not in my contract.\n\nRight?\n\nI can\'t... they can\'t legally make me do that.\n\nLook, as much as video game reviews can be an imperfect reflection of the person who\n\nis writing them, they are still a pretty solid baseline for which video games mattered in our culture.\n\nEven if a review is bad, it still means it was good enough for someone to spend time on it.\n\nSo I went Metacritic and I took all the games that were rated 80 or above, and at\n\nthe time of writing this script, that was 181 games.\n\nSo I\'m gonna do the formula for all of those.\n\nSome of these games were DLCs or re-releases onto new platforms.\n\nThe Switch alone resurrected about a dozen candidates from years past.\n\nBut since they were released this year, they are still technically in the running.\n\nFight me.\n\nNow that we have the list, it\'s time to make the formula, and it might surprise you to\n\nhear this, but I have not been in a pure mathematics class in about five years.\n\nSo I reached out to some scientists.\n\nAnd then none of them got back to me.\n\nSo I called my old roommate.\n\n“Hey, I’m Nicholas.\n\nI’m a graduate student studying exoplanet atmospheres.”\n\nNick is working toward a PhD at MIT, and though I was a bit worried about reaching out to\n\nhim since his specialization is in astrophysics and not stats about video games,\n\nhe assuaged all my fears.\n\nBrian - "Would you say you are a math expert?”\n\nNick - “No.”\n\nWe chatted for about a half an hour, diving deep into the scientific method and the selfless\n\ngoals of discovery.\n\nBrian - “If I invent a unit... can I trademark it.”\n\nNick - “I think your final score should be, like, in Gilberts or whatever.”\n\nBrian - "OK!"\n\nAnd we finished our chat with the reassurance that this formula was not only going to help\n\nthe gaming community, but the scientific community at large.\n\nBrian - “Do you think if I wrote this up, I could get it published in, like, Nature?"\n\nNick - “No.”\n\nSo where to do we go from here now that we have been scientifically rejuvenated?\n\nIt\'s time to build the criteria.\n\nWhat specifically makes a game of the year?\n\nNumber one, what is the game worth?\n\nWe\'re not just talking about monetary worth, we\'re also talking about the amount of enjoyment\n\nyou get while playing the game.\n\nNumber two, how them graphics?\n\nWe’re trying to find specific numbers associated with these games, and graphics is just a bunch\n\nof numbers anyway, so this will be a useful part.\n\nNumber three, how did it affect the cultural miasma?\n\nLook, it’s all about those google results, how many people are talking about the game?\n\nAnd most importantly, is the game art?\n\nI\'ve figured it out.\n\nWhich means that no one has to write any more goddamn thinkpieces about this topic ever again!\n\nGiven these four criteria, I sat down with Tara Long, former bioinformatics researcher\n\nand also my current boss.\n\nShe and I figured out a formula that will end up with a numerical value that will tell\n\nus the game of the year.\n\nThe higher the number, the better the game.\n\nWe’ll start with game worth.\n\nNow it’s hard for us to find how worth it a game is to play from a numerical standpoint,\n\nbut if you take Metacritic’s score as a percentage of the game you enjoy, and you\n\nmultiply that by the average amount of minutes each playthrough takes using the stats from\n\nhowlongtobeat.com, then you end up with a number of minutes you have spent enjoying said game.\n\nNow, to tie in material worth, we want to go ahead and take in the original listed price\n\nof the game and divide it by this number so that way we can end up with a DPM: dollars\n\nper minute enjoyed.\n\nNow, it’s hard to decide if you want a high or a low DPM, because some people want the\n\nmost bang for their buck, while others are willing to spend a little bit more for a really\n\nwell-enjoyed minute.\n\nBut just to standardize this, I\'m going to assume lower is better — that means you\'ve\n\npaid less per minute you\'ve enjoyed — and that way I can use it to divide literally\n\nthe rest of the equation.\n\nHOW BOUT THEM GRAPHICS?\n\nIn the past few years, people have cared less and less about how many\n\npolygons you\'ve got on the screen and more about the style.\n\nBut one thing that hasn\'t changed is frame rate.\n\nPeople want the most frames per second.\n\nSo, factually, the more frames, the better.\n\nThat means we\'re going to go ahead and take the highest frame rate available in the game\n\nand we\'re gonna multiply that by the seconds of average playthrough, again from howlongtobeat.com.\n\nAnd that will give us the amount of frames per game.\n\nThe game frames mainframe.\n\nBut how many frames does a gamer game in the gameframe mainframe?\n\nThat\'s a good question.\n\nNow if you go ahead and you take your frames per game and divide it by the number of gamers,\n\nI’m talking about however many copies have been sold or however many number of downloads\n\nthere have been, then that\'s going to leave you with frames per game per gamer, and that’s\n\na really important number, because if you have 200,000 frames per game and you have\n\n200,000 gamers, that\'s 200,000 gamers that have only had one frame per game per gamer.\n\nAnd that is no good, is it?\n\nIs it?\n\nI actually have... um, I\'m a little confused now.\n\nWe\'re gonna take frames per game per gamer and we\'re gonna put it on the top of this\n\nequation, because we want it to be the biggest number possible.\n\nAnd now it’s time for cultural relevancy.\n\nWe want our games of the year to be big and brash and bold and boisterous, letting people\n\noutside of the gaming world know,\n\nHey!\n\nThis is a thing!\n\nSo how do we judge a game’s effect on the world at large?\n\nWell, we go ahead and we take all of the Google results that come up when you search\n\nthe game\'s full name and the word game.\n\nBut that’s not everything, right?\n\nThat\'s just the bare minimum.\n\nIt\'s like saying, “This dude’s bad haircut is important just because a lot of people are talking about it,”\n\nwhich I know isn’t true from personal experience.\n\nSo I went on twitter and I asked you lovely folks what descriptors you expect to see in\n\ndescriptions of games of the year.\n\nAnd you gave me a lot.\n\nSo I went ahead and I plugged all those into Google’s advanced search along with the\n\ngame\'s name, and I took those results and I multiplied it by the base Google search.\n\nAnd I got very big numbers.\n\nBut don\'t worry, we\'re going to bring these numbers down to size, because some of the\n\ndescriptions you sent in were actually pretty negative descriptions of games.\n\nSo I did a Google search using those descriptions, and then I multiplied those results by one\n\nplus the number of Funko Pops made of characters in the game,\n\nwhich is objectively a terrible thing.\n\nNow this is going to leave you with BCE, or your base cultural effect, and we\'re gonna\n\nmultiply that by our FPGPG in order to get a pretty big number.\n\nBut before we’re done with cultural effect, I want you to ask yourself, is this the culture at large?\n\nDoes this go outside of our gaming bubble?\n\nThere’s really only one way to tell that, and that\'s by using the M.O.M. variable,\n\nwhich stands for: "My Own Mother."\n\nSo I called my own mother for help.\n\n"Hello, Brian, I\'m a follower and a subscriber as well as your mother."\n\nBrian - "That\'s very good to hear.\n\nI... you support me so well and I appreciate that.\n\nI should ask you, Mom, would you consider yourself a gamer?"\n\nMom - "When I play Mario Kart with, like, grandchildren and things like that, I always\n\ngo off the road."\n\nBrian - "That\'s, but, on purpose to let them feel better."\n\nMom - "Very similar to my real-life driving skills, I find."\n\nBrian - "I have a list of 181 video games, now I know that\'s a lot.\n\nI\'m basically gonna run through this, and I\'m gonna ask you if you have heard of this game.\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2."\n\nMom - "No."\n\nBrian - "God of War."\n\nMom - "Yes!\n\nI have heard of that."\n\nBrian - "Oh, OK!"\n\nWhile subjecting my mom to a litany of 2018\'s best games,\n\nit became clear that she was very interested in the topic.\n\nBrian - "We\'re only 57 in, so we\'ve still got another 130 to go."\n\nMom - "I can\'t tell you how, what an exciting time this is for me."\n\nBrian - "Now you get taste of what it\'s like to do my job."\n\nMom - "I tell you what, this is a lot of research into things that really have very little meaning."\n\nBrian - "You\'re right.\n\nIt is."\n\nSo once I had asked my mom about all of the games from the game of the year list, I was\n\nable to throw it into a boolean function.\n\nIf mom knows game equals true, then that’s a plus one here.\n\nAnd then I could raise our base cultural effect to the power of mom, so if she doesn\'t know\n\nit, that\'s just to the power of one.\n\nIf she does, that\'s to the power of two.\n\nFinally, it’s time for our fourth, and perhaps most important criteria: Is this game art?\n\nAnd when you start asking if something is art, then you really end up asking,\n\n"Why should we even be defining what is and isn\'t art?"\n\nAnd the only thing worse than discourse about "are games art?" is\n\nthe discourse ABOUT the discourse of "are games art?"\n\nLook, art is experiential and that\'s a beautiful thing that should be allowed to flourish without\n\nhaving some pseudoscientific proof of greatness thrust upon it.\n\nWhich is why I\'m not proving greatness.\n\nInstead, this part of the formula is so revolutionary because I am proving art.\n\nSo let\'s go ahead and throw this into...\n\nShit, I ran out of space.\n\nYou know what, this part wasn\'t that important.\n\nWe\'re just gonna cut it.\n\nThis big GOTY equation ends up with very large numbers, which would be too hard to show all of.\n\nSo I needed to make a new unit.\n\nSomething I could reduce them all down to.\n\nI plugged in my favorite game of the year, Celeste, and I used that to be our new baseline.\n\nCeleste equals one BDG.\n\nOr Big Determinant of Game.\n\nEverything else will be reduced down using Celeste’s score to a scale of BDGs.\n\nSo that\'s it.\n\nThat’s the entire formula.\n\nAnd if you\'ll excuse me, I have to go do my dark bidding on these spreadsheets and I will\n\ncome back to you right now.\n\nDecember 30th.\n\nNew year is at our doorstep.\n\nKnock knock!\n\nWho’s there?\n\nIt’s 2019!\n\nCome on in, hope you\'re not as big of an asshole as the past few of your friends!\n\nI spent the past two weeks crunching the numbers, and it is my honor to announce that\n\n2018’s scientifically calculated game of the year, with 19...\n\ntrillion BDGs...\n\nis Fortnite.\n\nThat can\'t be the right number, I\'m gonna...\n\nNo, that\'s right.\n\nYou remember when Pluto stopped being a planet, and the scientists were like,\n\n"Hey, that\'s just what the definitions say!"\n\nAnd we were like,\n\n"Hey, scientists, maybe your definitions are busted!"\n\nMaybe my formula is busted.\n\nThe fact that God of War got 2.1 million BDGs and Red Dead Redemption 2 got 0.1 BDG...\n\nMaybe I shouldn\'t have made my mom\'s knowledge of the game an exponential factor.\n\nBrian - "You know Tetris.\n\nYou would really like this Tetris..."\n\nMom - *sings the entire Tetris song*\n\nNo, I stand by that decision.\n\nLet’s be honest, the stats I was using definitely favored cultural importance, and Fortnite’s\n\ncultural effect was orders of magnitude larger than any other game this year.\n\nAnd though I\'ve never played Fortnite\n\n— which proves my lack of bias and also that I’m professionally irresponsible —\n\nthere can be no denying that it has made a lasting impact\n\noutside of the video game world.\n\nIt’s the only nonseries game that my mom knew about.\n\nAnd regardless of how you feel about the Fortnite, it drew together a collection of people that\n\nmight not have otherwise connected, and that’s a valuable thing.\n\nAnd even when your Uncle Devin comes up to you at the holiday get together and says,\n\n“HEY BRIAN, WHAT IN THE HECK IS THIS FORTNITE THING?”\n\nit gives you a common ground to chat,\n\nand you really haven\'t chatted with Uncle Devin in a while.\n\nYou should call him more often.\n\nHe wants to show you his Civil War books.\n\nAnd his collection of swords.\n\nBut if you’re upset, and you didn’t IMMEDIATELY close this YouTube tab to send me an angry tweet,\n\nI’ve got an extra little gift for you.\n\nIt\'s a new formula.\n\nGOTY equals x times 1 quadrillion.\n\nAnd x equals your favorite game.\n\nOf this year.\n\nNow you can go ahead and tell your friends that Brian scientifically proved that my favorite game\n\nis the game of the year, and then you can share them this link,\n\nand then they won’t click on it because it’s a 15 minute video, so your secret is safe with me.\n\nAnd to be honest, your favorite game deserves it,\n\nbecause if you liked it enough to call it your game of the year,\n\nthen it must be pretty meaningful to you,\n\nand no one can take that away.\n\nSo congratulations, Fortnite, and congratulations, your favorite game.\n\nHere’s hoping 2019 is full of wonderful games and even more wonderful experiences.\n\n*wink*\n\nHappy New Year.\n\nOH.\n\nOH MY GOD THAT IS SO HOT.\n\nOHHH MY GOD.\n\nIT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PROP WATER, PAT.\n\nOH I PROBABLY JUST LIKE RUINED THIS MIC, TOO.\n\nJESUS, PAT.\n\nI TOLD YOU IT WAS PROP WATER.\n\nGOD.\n\nI\'m okay.\n\nMom - "Does enthusiasm count or anything like that?\n\nShould it just be, or just be, just bare bones..."\n\nBrian - "Mom, to be honest, I don\'t think you can do this not enthusiastically, so,\n\nyou\'re gonna be fine." ', ' PC gaming is a vast ocean of entertainment,\n\nand if you want to explore, all you have to do is sail out.\n\nAnd speaking of selling out,\n\nthis is my first-ever sponsored video!\n\nThat\'s right, the-\n\nthe folks over at Riot have decided to corporately sanction\n\na video from a man who is best known\n\nfor hanging sad clown portraits in his apartment.\n\nYou see, they just released VALORANT,\n\nand since I\'m currently stuck at home\n\nthey were kind enough to give me a budget\n\nto help turbocharge my computer,\n\nso that way I could unravel how to get good at PC gaming.\n\nBut the thing about VALORANT\n\nis that you don\'t need a high-end PC to play it.\n\nRiot told me that even on an old clunker\n\nwith minimum specs, you can still play competitively.\n\nAnd sure enough, I excavated my ancient PC\n\nin order to test this, and it played great.\n\n- It plays great.\n\nOh, that doesn\'t count.\n\nSo I could use that sponsorship money\n\nto soup up my computer or I could use it\n\nto solve one of PC gaming\'s biggest problems.\n\nUnlike a console, which can plug into a communal TV,\n\ntrue PC gaming needs a dedicated space.\n\nI live in a three-bedroom apartment with two other roommates\n\nand they are not gonna be cool with me\n\nsetting up my sick rig in the spot where we keep\n\nrecycling that we haven\'t taken out in two weeks.\n\nIn fact, the only unused personal space I have\n\nis this four-foot square right next to my radiator.\n\nAnd I like to keep that block unused\n\nfor whenever I wanna feel like a rich person.\n\n- Check me out!\n\nBut maybe, with a little help from my sponsor...\'s money,\n\nI can turn those 16 square feet into a gamer\'s paradise.\n\nToday I\'m teaching you how to make the perfect gamer space.\n\n(lively dance music)\n\nOh!\n\nYeah!\n\nFor inspiration, I asked a couple coworkers\n\nwhat they look for in a PC gaming space.\n\n- Hi, I\'m Jeff Ramos.\n\n- I\'m Julia.\n\nIf there was anyone at Polygon who could lead me\n\nto gamer space perfection it would be Jeff and Julia,\n\nand in our discussions it became clear\n\nthat there are four major elements\n\nto a good gaming environment.\n\nThe first is a solid foundation.\n\nIf I want to build a PC gaming space,\n\nwhere should I start?\n\n- First, I think you need a computer.\n\n- Check!\n\nBut without these other foundational elements,\n\nI\'ll have less of a gamer space\n\nand more of an ominous obelisk.\n\nFrom there, you can start embellishing your foundation\n\nwith element two, a virtual gaming space,\n\nwhich is just a fancy way of saying\n\na place you can stream games from.\n\n- It made me feel a little less lonely\n\nas I\'m studying and stuff,\n\nbecause there\'s just like a voice.\n\nAnd I guess I wanted to do that for people, also.\n\n- Streaming for you was less about\n\ngetting big and it was more about\n\nsharing an experience with your friends.\n\n- If I got big along the way I would be like, "That\'s fine."\n\n- Element three is aesthetics.\n\nIf you\'re gonna spend hours at your computer,\n\nat the very least it should be nice to look at,\n\nand it should represent you.\n\n- Everything else at my desk is black.\n\nThere\'s very little decoration, and I like that\n\n\'cause it\'s clear mind, I can just focus\n\non what I\'m doing at any given moment,\n\nversus looking at a desk full of Funko Pops.\n\n- I had, I think, this specific Pop figure\n\nof Vi from "League of Legends."\n\nand then it just kind of expanded.\n\nSince I work from home, too,\n\nI try to make my space fun and engaging.\n\n- And the final element: Caters to bodily needs.\n\n- What type of chair is that that you\'re sitting in?\n\n- Oh, it\'s a terrible one and it\'s going to be replaced.\n\nAnd it gives me consistent back pain.\n\n- Does that affect your gaming at all?\n\n- If I\'m not comfortable, then I\'m just thinking,\n\n"Dang, my butt hurts, my back hurts,"\n\nand then I can\'t pay attention to things.\n\n- Do you ever eat near your computer?\n\nDo you ever have to refuel?\n\n- I try to separate eating from my desk space.\n\nThere is a space off to the left where I usually\n\nwill always have a coffee cup and a water bottle,\n\nand sometimes there\'ll be like a snack.\n\n- When you\'re in the throes of a match,\n\nyou don\'t wanna be worried about your back hurting\n\nor feeling a little famished,\n\nand that means your gamer space should provide\n\nthe fuel and comfort your body needs.\n\nIf you can amalgamate these four elements,\n\nyou\'ll have a good gamer space.\n\nBut I\'m making the perfect one.\n\nAnd how can we prove it\'s perfect?\n\nAn increase in gaming performance!\n\nHa ha, you thought I wasn\'t gonna do\n\nwhat I was sponsored to do!\n\nGet outta here, I\'m just killin\' two birds with one stone!\n\nMy coworkers said in no uncertain terms\n\nthat a good gamer space will make me a better gamer.\n\nOnce I have a dedicated space,\n\nthat\'s gonna be all I\'m gonna need\n\nin order to be proficient at this game?\n\n- Well, you should still practice a little bit, I mean--\n\n- Though I normally don\'t let little things like rules\n\nstand between me and victory,\n\n"Valorant" has anti-cheat software\n\nthat kinda makes that impossible,\n\nso there really is no way for me\n\nto get good at this game without practicing.\n\nBut a perfect gamer space will envelop me\n\nin a cocoon of learning,\n\nshutting out the world around me.\n\nBy the end of this build, I\'ll prove\n\nthat I\'ve developed a perfect gamer space\n\nby showing just how much better at PC gaming I\'ve become.\n\nLuckily, that\'s not a very high bar.\n\nThat doesn\'t count.\n\nAnd with my four elements defined, it was time to start.\n\nI taped out the four-by-four square\n\nand purchased a desk that would fit within the perimeter,\n\nbuilt the desk, got the monitor unpacked,\n\ncomputer, keyboard, mouse in position,\n\nand we were in business.\n\nElement one, check.\n\nI hopped right into "Valorant," and things were going\n\nway better than with my coffee table setup.\n\nAnd in hindsight,\n\nmaybe I should\'ve stopped there.\n\nBut I still had money to burn.\n\nYou see, I really was getting better at "Valorant,"\n\nbut I had no way of clearly showing\n\njust how well I was doing.\n\nAnd as Jeff said--\n\n- \'Cause if I no-scope and there\'s no one around to see it,\n\nthen does it matter?\n\n- I ordered a nice microphone and got out my old webcam\n\nto set up my streaming space.\n\nAll right, check, check.\n\nWe are set to go, everything looks great on the... game.\n\nThings do not look as great...\n\nAlthough I was prepared to start gaming for the masses,\n\nmy room was not.\n\nI can do better than this.\n\nIf I go live with this setup,\n\neveryone\'s gonna make fun of my finger-jointed\n\nbuilder\'s-grade garbage molding!\n\nI can\'t be known as the substandard molding guy.\n\nLuckily, I had two sources of inspiration\n\nfor gamer space aesthetics on opposite\n\nsides of the spectrum.\n\nI wanted to land somewhere in the middle.\n\nObviously, the first step\n\nwas installing RGB LEDs, because a gamer space\n\nwithout constantly changing rainbow lights\n\nis like a little league coach without wraparound Oakleys.\n\nI also purchased a modest number of game figurines,\n\nbecause even with a sponsor,\n\nhoo boy, those things are expensive.\n\nBut at the end of this, my space still felt pretty empty,\n\nso I gathered all the figurines I could find.\n\nAll of them.\n\nBeyond this, there was nothing behind me\n\nto brand me as a true gamer for the stream viewers,\n\nso I mocked up a quick poster idea\n\nand sent it over to my coworker Pat\n\nfor some illustration work,\n\nand used a little bit more of that sponsor money\n\nto purchase a large cloth banner.\n\nOh my god.\n\nIt\'s perfect.\n\nFinally, I purchased a video game-themed birthday party set,\n\nand with that my aesthetic was complete.\n\nWhat\'s up, y\'all!\n\nI am back at it at the streaming setup.\n\nWe\'ve got everyone here.\n\nYou can tell, as I always say back there,\n\ndon\'t talk to me before I\'ve had my gaming.\n\nI just have a little, there\'s actually nothing in this cup.\n\nI should probably get something into this cup.\n\nJeff warned me about keeping snacks off my desk,\n\nbut I was worried about getting hangry\n\nin the middle of gaming.\n\nSo I prepped some peanut butter toast.\n\nAlso, Julia had a specific piece of advice\n\nabout emotional needs.\n\n- I have one of the guy from Beastars,\n\nso when I get too mad about playing video games\n\nI can look at him and he\'ll soothe me.\n\n- Though the sight of an anthropomorphic wolf\n\nisn\'t necessarily soothing to me,\n\nI do think it\'s important for me to have something\n\nto calm me down after the rough matches:\n\nWarm milk.\n\nAnd I still had some sponsorship money left over,\n\nso I purchased myself a gamer chair.\n\nUnfortunately, the only one that could ship in time\n\nwas the largest size, which meant\n\nI had to rearrange some furniture.\n\nAnd with that, the perfect gamer space was complete,\n\nall four elements checked.\n\nThe gamer space is created,\n\nand all that\'s left for me to do\n\nis be the gamer within the space.\n\nI played a few matches, taking a sip from the warm milk\n\nany time I got a little flustered.\n\nBut for some reason, I wasn\'t much better\n\nthan when I started this journey.\n\nIt\'s just that my wrists hurt.\n\nThat\'s the only reason why things aren\'t going great.\n\nEven after running to the drugstore\n\nto pick up some compression braces,\n\nmy gaming didn\'t improve.\n\nIt didn\'t make any sense.\n\nI had spent over a week building this gamer space,\n\nwhich included dozens of minutes playing VALORANT.\n\nWhy wasn\'t I any better?\n\nThe space isn\'t perfect yet.\n\nThat\'s the only explanation.\n\nI hadn\'t reached my goal of being a better PC gamer.\n\nBut I also hadn\'t run out of sponsor money.\n\nIt was time for a second pass.\n\nMy single monitor wasn\'t giving me\n\nenough screen real estate for what really mattered:\n\nMy stream setup.\n\nSo I got a second one, and also some nice lights.\n\nWe have now upgraded our new space.\n\nI can now see my game, and I can also see\n\nwhat my stream setup\'s gonna be.\n\nIt\'s lookin\' good.\n\nEnough.\n\nBut good enough is never enough\n\nwhen one is striving for perfection.\n\nThe problem with streaming is that most people are okay\n\nwith one camera and one game.\n\nI am an auteur who understand the importance\n\nof cilimintography, and if I\'m supposed to stream\n\nin a manner that matches my ourverver,\n\nI NEED.\n\nMORE.\n\nCAMERAS.\n\nSadly, pretty much every webcam is currently sold out.\n\nI was running low on time,\n\nand that\'s one thing sponsor money can\'t buy.\n\nBut it can buy enterprise level\n\nvideo conferencing solutions.\n\nJust wanted to check in really quickly\n\nto let you know that\n\nI am unstoppable!\n\n*CACKLING*\n\n- [Roommate] Brian!\n\n- Sorry.\n\nI figured out how to do three cams on OBS,\n\nand now I can play a game.\n\nWhich is great, except looking at the overlay,\n\nit\'s a little busy.\n\nOur little test proved that there were\n\ntwo big issues with our space.\n\nThe first was that the cameras took up most of the screen.\n\nThe second is that my roommates didn\'t enjoy hearing me yell,\n\nwhich is nothing new.\n\nBut that\'s when it hit me.\n\nI have a plan on how to kill two birds with one stone:\n\nBy recycling all of the boxes I\'ve received.\n\nIf I could create a soundproof box around my gamer space\n\nand cover it in a green screen,\n\nthen I\'d have more screen space\n\nand my roommates would stop yelling at me.\n\nSo I used more of my sponsorship money\n\nto buy a bunch of expensive studio foam,\n\nand I taped it to a bunch of cardboard.\n\nAnd then I threw a green screen over the top of it\n\nand viola, a hermetically sealed gamer space.\n\nNow, a few of you might be wondering,\n\n"How does one get into this space?"\n\nBut you\'ll see that right behind my air conditioning unit,\n\nthere\'s a way that I can crawl underneath there.\n\nAnd the best part about it, it\'s not even dark\n\nbecause we\'ve got the... I put in the LEDs!\n\nAll I have to do is just weasel my way in.\n\nThey say, "No pain, no gain."\n\nAnd you know, I\'m a gamer\n\n"No pame, no game."\n\nMaybe that\'s better than my current slogan.\n\nOh, get the head through first,\n\n\'cause that\'s the hardest part of it, you know.\n\nJust kinda like...\n\nbeing born.\n\nAh, okay.\n\nOh.\n\nDo a quick one 180.\n\nAnd then you swap up, and then you\'re here.\n\nAnd then you\'re in the,\n\n(sighs) and then you\'re in the gamer space.\n\nAs easy as pie.\n\nAfter a vigorous four-minute entrance,\n\nit was clear that things were working out great.\n\nCheck this out!\n\nLook, there\'s so much I can,\n\nyou can see the whole UI.\n\nSo there is the problem of these screens.\n\nI spend a lot of time trying to make sure\n\nthat I had a cool-looking background.\n\nSuch is the curse of the green screen.\n\nThough you can put anything behind it,\n\nsometimes you are left with the void.\n\nI worked so hard to make sure\n\nthat my background expressed my gamerhood,\n\nand the gamer box just covered it up.\n\nI wanted to digitally recreate it,\n\nbut since I had three cameras it would have to be in 3D.\n\nSo I reached out to my coworker Jenna\n\nto mock something up in Blender for me,\n\nbased on some previous images I had of my gamer space.\n\nOkay, so we just got the new background set up.\n\nLet\'s get up in here!\n\nAlrighty, okay.\n\n(grunting) Okay!\n\nI can...\n\nShit.\n\n(groans) My shirt got caught on a thing.\n\nThis was a rude awakening, but a necessary one.\n\nMy current clothing setup was not compatible\n\nwith the gaming rig, so I figured out a new way\n\nto kill two birds with one stone.\n\nThe idea came from my compression braces.\n\nMy wrists felt so much better while compressed,\n\nand it made me wonder:\n\nWhat if all of me was compressed?\n\nSo I looked up those tactical black skin suits\n\nthat athletes wear in the Olympics,\n\nbut I was running dangerously low on time and money\n\nso I had to order from a less-than-scrupulous vendor.\n\nAnd when it finally arrived it was not to my specifications.\n\nI didn\'t have any more time.\n\nThe deadline was fast approaching.\n\nSo I dealt with what I had,\n\ncrawled into my sweltering gamer space and--\n\nI see what the problem is now.\n\nMy new compression suit was causing me\n\nto dissolve into Jenna\'s wonderful background.\n\nSo I asked her to remodel it,\n\nthis time with a 3D photorealistic virtual Brian\n\nthat I could superimpose my face onto.\n\nAnd the worst part of it was that--\n\nAnd I forgot my snacks!\n\nBut in all tribulations there is a chance for greatness,\n\nand greatness was found with a little inspiration,\n\na little heat exhaustion\n\nand the very last of my sponsorship money.\n\nI\'m covered head to toe in this important green screen,\n\nand I don\'t want this to get marred, obviously.\n\nSo what I\'ve come up with,\n\ninstead of having to eat toast with my hands,\n\nis that I\'ve purchased\n\na horse feedbag.\n\nAnd I was worried about, you know,\n\nmy hot milk is gonna start to cool down.\n\nAnd my computer right now is running a little bit hot, too.\n\nWhy don\'t I just kill two birds with one stone?\n\nThere are tons of liquid-cooled computers out there,\n\nand if I use this tubing, I can feed the cool milk\n\nthrough the PC, cooling it down perfectly,\n\nup around my headset, over the microphone.\n\nOkay, I got my feedbag, which will allow me to eat my snacks\n\nand then I\'ve got my warm milk, which is also\n\ngonna be cooling my computer in the box.\n\nI\'ll have my snacks and I\'ll have my box,\n\nand I can stay in there.\n\nWith the invention of the milk-cooled PC, patent pending,\n\nand the feedback-sustained me, patent pending,\n\nthe perfect gamer space was complete.\n\nOkay.\n\n(grunts) Hello!\n\nGamers.\n\nI have my feedbag, I tossed it over beforehand.\n\nThe crown of it all,\n\nmy milk-cooled PC.\n\n(Brian panting)\n\nLet\'s get gamin\'.\n\nThought the feedbag worked wonders,\n\nI was still doing poorly in my matches.\n\nI was getting flustered and couldn\'t focus,\n\nbut that\'s nothing a little warm milk couldn\'t help.\n\nCome on! (groans)\n\nSee, I don\'t get, oh, no no no no no, stop!\n\nNo no no, uh, shit!\n\nShit, shit!\n\nAh!\n\nOh, this is bad!\n\nThis is very bad!\n\nThis is very bad!\n\nAfter mopping up the MILK MSTR\'s lactose coolant fluid\n\nand toweling myself off,\n\nI broke out the gaming laptop I borrowed from work\n\nand sat back down in my original VALORANT test position.\n\nAnd I was better.\n\nWithout the lights and the monitors\n\nand the hands-free snacks,\n\nI was gaming better on a coffee table\n\nthan in my dedicated space.\n\nSo did I screw up\n\nand kill too many birds with too few stones?\n\nOr was I a less than perfect gamer?\n\nPerhaps I was asking a toddler to pilot a helicopter.\n\nThere\'s nothing wrong with\n\nmy hot cardboard box of gaming perfection.\n\nI simply was not ready to handle it responsibly.\n\nOne day, I will reenter that cocoon\n\nand emerge a wonderful gaming butterfly.\n\nBut before I grow my wings,\n\nthis little grub must learn to crawl.\n\nAnd also how to defuse the spike without dying.\n\nIt seems impossible.\n\nHas anyone done it yet?\n\nI doubt anyone\'s done that yet.\n\nThat\'s ridiculous.\n\n(cheery music)\n\nOh, I\'m so dumb.\n\nI screwed it in the wrong way.\n\n- [Karen] I didn\'t wanna say nothin\'.\n\n- You didn\'t wanna say nothin\'?\n\n- [Karen] Well, I looked at it and I knew.\n\n- You looked at it and you knew?\n\n- [Karen] Yeah. (laughs)\n\n- And you didn\'t say nothin\'?\n\nNo! ', ' Kingdom Hearts 3 is finally here.\n\nAnd I have received an excessive amount of requests to explain the storyline.\n\nThat seems perfectly reasonable.\n\nYou want to be caught up before you hop into the third game.\n\nBut judging by the wording on a few of these requests, it seems like I have a…\n\nTALL TASK\n\nahead of me.\n\nBut could I possibly help you understand the gargantuan, magnificent,\n\nepic storyline of Kingdom Hearts?\n\nYou sweet summer child.\n\nYou babe swaddled in the cashmere blanket of ignorance.\n\nYOU ASK TOO LITTLE OF ME.\n\nBecause not only can I help you understand Kingdom Hearts.\n\nBut I will give you the tools necessary to understand any story you are ever faced with\n\nfor the rest of your life.\n\n*music plays*\n\nPlease, oh baby, don’t go.\n\n~Simple and clean is the way that you\'re making me feel tonight.~\n\n*CLAP CLAP*\n\nSpoiler Warning!\n\nI’m about to explain the entirety of the Kingdom Hearts series.\n\nNow, if you don’t want to be spoiled for all of the games released up until now…\n\nI don’t know why you clicked on this video.\n\nBecause I feel like the title kinda explained that that’s what I was gonna do.\n\nSo that’s on you.\n\nUh, but ALSO.\n\nPotential spoiler warning!\n\nYou see, when I explain the tools of the literary trade, I might just be able to accurately\n\npredict the true ending of Kingdom Hearts 3.\n\nNow, the game hasn’t been released yet, and I have not played it, but…\n\nConsider yourself warned.\n\nWe’re talking about the hero’s journey or the monomyth.\n\nThis is a concept that’s been around for a long time.\n\nBut it was popularized by a guy named Joseph Campbell back in 1949 when he released a book\n\ncalled The Hero with a Thousand Faces.\n\nCampbell inspired plenty of other creative writers and literary analysts, including a\n\nguy called Christopher Vogler, who wrote his own book in the 1990s.\n\nBut before that, in the 1980s, he was working as a story consultant for a little company\n\ncalled Disney.\n\nWhen he was there, he sent out a seven-page memo that basically broke down all the big\n\nideas from Campbell’s book into 12 simple steps to writing good stories.\n\nDid the memo work?\n\nI don’t know.\n\nWhy don’t you ask Timon and Pumbaa?\n\nThey…\n\nThey’re from the Lion King.\n\nThat was a movie that Disney Produced.\n\nA lot of people think it’s a great movie.\n\nKingdom Hearts as described by the monomyth.\n\nWe’ve got 12 stages up here, kinda like a clock.\n\nIt’s a story wheel.\n\nAnd I’ll go through piece by piece explaining Kingdom Hearts 1, so that way you can understand\n\nwhat these stages are.\n\nOnce you do understand these stages, you’ll be able to understand any story!\n\nBecause great writers, no matter how dense their sci-fi or fantasy world may be, use\n\nthese stages to help orient you.\n\nI’m talking Dune.\n\nHarry Potter.\n\nSpace Jam.\n\nNumber one, introduction in the ordinary world.\n\nIn Kingdom Hearts 1, this is when Sora, Riku, and Kairi are all just hanging out on Destiny\n\nIslands, doing normal kid stuff.\n\nCall to adventure.\n\nWhat’s this?\n\nWeird creatures showing up on the island?\n\nSora has a sword that’s also a key?\n\nRefusal of the call.\n\nNow we hit a bit of a hiccup here because he really does seem gung-ho to leave the island\n\nat some point.\n\nBut I don’t think he wanted to do it on these terms, so I’ll still call this a refusal.\n\nMeeting with the mentor.\n\nAt this point Sora is in Traverse Town, and he meets Leon, who ends up giving him some\n\nguidance on what he’s supposed to be doing.\n\nCrossing the threshold.\n\nOr as true literary critics call it…\n\nboarding the gummi ship.\n\nTests, allies, and enemies.\n\nThis is pretty much the entirety of the Disney worlds.\n\nYou’ll notice that a lot of times in these synopses of Kingdom Hearts,\n\npeople just skip over them.\n\nIt’s cause they all fit here.\n\nReaching the innermost cave.\n\nThis is such a pivotal moment in the story.\n\nIn Star Wars, this is when Luke goes into the cave and faces off against a shadow version\n\nof himself.\n\nAnd in Kingdom Hearts, this is when Sora goes into Hollow Bastion so he can fight Riku, who is\n\nactually being possessed by Ansem, who is the Heartless version of Terra-Xehanort, who\n\nwas originally Terra but was then possessed by Xehanort before him.\n\nSame thing.\n\nEnduring the supreme ordeal.\n\nAfter Sora has faced off against Ansem the first time, he has to stab his own heart with\n\na keyblade, so that way he can release it and save Kairi.\n\nThat’s a supreme ordeal.\n\nSeizing the sword.\n\nNow this is not a literal sword.\n\nObviously, Sora already has one of those.\n\nBut instead it’s the reward or the power that Sora can take with him.\n\nSo in this case, it’s him being resurrected, having all of the princesses of heart saved,\n\nand having the power to defeat Ansem.\n\nThe road back.\n\nAnsem has been defeated by Kingdom Hearts being opened and him being ripped apart by\n\nthe light.\n\nAnd they are able to seal the doors, but unfortunately, they lose two of their friends in the process.\n\nResurrection.\n\nYeah, Sora did get literally resurrected a few stages before this.\n\nUh, but this is more of a metaphysical resurrection.\n\nThem finally coming back from the brink.\n\nKairi going back to Destiny Islands.\n\nReturn with the elixir.\n\nSora, Donald, and Goofy all go back out, using their combined experience to try to save Mickey\n\nand Riku.\n\nAnd that\'s Kingdom Hearts!\n\nThat was pretty painless, don\'t you think?\n\nBut granted, that\'s not what people have an issue with.\n\nPeople have an issue with all of the overarching story of Kingdom Hearts.\n\nBut, again, as long as we stick to these 12 stages, we should be able to take this apart,\n\npiece by piece.\n\nAnd though I am gonna stick with the 12 stages, I am gonna add just, uh, one little extra piece.\n\nIt\'s called historical background.\n\nThis is like The Silmarillion.\n\nOr JK Rowling\'s twitter.\n\nIn Kingdom Hearts, this would be Union Cross, or Chi, or whatever the many names of this\n\nweb/mobile game ended up being.\n\nDie-hard fans will get upset with me if I say this doesn\'t really matter to Sora\'s overarching story.\n\nBut I\'m gonna say it anyway.\n\nSo this historical background is gonna just be up here.\n\nAnd all of that knowledge is just gonna kind of bleed immediately into Kingdom Hearts 1.\n\nPat (offscreen): Uh, nope, you gotta do Birth by Sleep.\n\nPat: It\'s a prequel.\n\nBrian: But, is Sora in it?\n\nPat: No.\n\nNo Sora.\n\nBrian: Who\'s this guy, then?\n\nPat: That\'s Vanitas.\n\nBrian: Why?\n\nSo I, uh, seem to have neglected, uh, like three other heroes\' journeys in this hero\'s journey.\n\nSo I\'m just gonna...\n\nI\'m gonna move these over a little bit so that way I can have a bit more space.\n\nWe, we do have to talk about Birth by Sleep.\n\nStarting first with Terra\'s.\n\nUm, now imagine it has all twelve of the stages of the hero\'s journey, I just didn\'t want\n\nto write \'em all out, \'cause he gets norted, so he\'s not that good of a hero.\n\nSame goes for Aqua, which is intersecting with Terra\'s.\n\nAnd then we\'ve got Ventus, who has the biggest bearing on Sora\'s hero\'s journey.\n\nIt means that it has to not only intersect over here with Terra and Aqua.\n\nBut, I\'m sorry Vogler, I am gonna have to include another step on your hero\'s journey.\n\nSo here we\'ve got the Ventus Diagram, uh, which intersects here at step point five.\n\nThe part of the hero\'s journey, uh, where the baby hero\'s heart goes and saves another boy.\n\nThat\'s the only big change we\'re gonna do to Vogler\'s story wheel.\n\nUh, everything else is gonna make sense in Kingdom Hearts.\n\nAnd now we\'re going to take the wheel, uh, as if it is the overarching story of the entirety\n\nof the games.\n\nSo Kingdom Hearts, the first one, instead of going from 1 all the way to 12, is actually\n\njust gonna go from 0.5 to 5.\n\nAnd then we start 5 immediately at Kingdom Hearts 2, which will begin with Sora...\n\nPat (offscreen): Nope.\n\nBrian: What do you mean nope?\n\nPat: There\'s two more.\n\nOnce again I seem to have neglected a few, uh, interstitial pieces of Kingdom Hearts.\n\nChain of Memories and also three five eight days over two.\n\nWhich is a totally normal title.\n\nIt\'s totally fine, because it just fleshes out Sora\'s hero\'s journey.\n\nAnd also... a different guy and his name is Roxas.\n\n*pained expression*\n\nI went ahead and I categorized Chain of Memories as a "hero\'s journey redux"\n\nsince Sora is just fighting against his own memories, the things that he has remembered\n\nfrom the past hero\'s journey.\n\nSo it\'s just gonna hang out around here.\n\nAnd then we have 358/2 Days, which follows Roxas, who is Sora\'s Nobody.\n\nAnd a Nobody is like the shell of a person after they\'ve released their heart.\n\n358/2 Days happens then, and since it\'s the hero\'s Nobody, it\'s actually within the hero\'s\n\njourney, doing its own thing.\n\nUm, and, I\'m gonna call this 4.5 remix.\n\nThis is a pivotal part of the hero\'s journey when, uh, the hero\'s shadow self goes off\n\nand eats ice cream.\n\nThese two are tied together by a character named Xion, who works in Organization XIII\n\nwith Roxas, and also is made from the memories... of Sora.\n\nShe doesn\'t really have like a hero\'s journey...\n\nI\'ll just tie it out for you.\n\nAnd since this oblong actually crosses through the hero\'s journey twice, we\'re gonna make\n\nthis easy to remember and call it the\n\n"Hero\'s Memories of the Hero\'s Journey Double Cross Oblong."\n\nOr HMHJXXO.\n\nIn Kingdom Hearts 2, we start out with Roxas and Sora, and Roxas is on summer vacation.\n\nWe\'re gonna have him start over here and just kind of go all the way up to enduring the\n\nsupreme ordeal, where he finally gives up his body to Sora so Sora can be whole.\n\nAnd we\'re just gonna call that "The Antihero\'s Cradle."\n\nAlright, so, we\'re done with Roxas, we\'re back with Sora.\n\nSo this should be a breeze.\n\nKingdom Hearts 2.\n\nAlright, he\'s already crossed the threshold.\n\nHe does the tests, allies, and enemies.\n\nThat\'s just the Disney stuff, we\'re gonna skip it.\n\nHe goes over, reaches the innermost cave, that would be the World that Never Was, where\n\nhe faces off against the supreme ordeal.\n\nXemnas, Organization XIII.\n\nSeizes the sword.\n\nHe gets the power to close Kingdom Hearts.\n\nAnd then finally, the road back.\n\nThey get home.\n\nThey get a letter from King Mickey, the contents of which will be revealed in...\n\nKingdom Hearts 3?\n\nPat (offscreen): No.\n\nFUCK!\n\nALRIGHT ASSHOLES.\n\nI have no more space here, so I made you a DATA CUBE.\n\nARE YA HAPPY?\n\nThe data cube contains the entirety of Kingdom Hearts Coded, which is all in a virtual space.\n\nThe data cube is that thing where the hero goes on a journey into his inner thoughts\n\nand finds some data that an old guy put in him.\n\nIt\'s that THING THAT HAPPENS IN THE HERO\'S JOURNEY.\n\nAnd then at the same time, we also have Dream Drop Distance, which... is another hero\'s\n\njourney inside of the hero\'s journey, and it\'s part of seizing the sword.\n\nBecause they have to go... into sleeping versions of the world\'s they\'ve already been to.\n\nBut also maybe they\'re... they\'re going into each other\'s dreams?\n\nAnd one of them is...\n\nNo, it doesn\'t fit here, I\'ve got a better...\n\nThere\'s another part of the hero\'s journey, and it\'s called the Dream Drop Bucket.\n\nAnd it\'s where you put the Dream Drop Distance until you need it later, and hopefully you won\'t.\n\nThat brings us up to Kingdom Hearts 3.\n\nGranted, I thought when I started this, I would be able to...\n\nperfectly predict, uh, Kingdom Hearts 3.\n\nBut, I don\'t know, I feel like I"m just missing something.\n\n*CAUSE He GeTs NOrTEd.*\n\n*BeING POsESSed bY AnSEM.*\n\n*By XeHAnORT.*\n\n*CAUSE HE GETS NORTED.*\n\nI forgot about the villain\'s journey.\n\nThe villain\'s tridecagon.\n\nThe villain\'s tridecagon is definitely the key.\n\nThe tridecagon of villainy.\n\nThis is a 13-sided shape that goes one further than dodecagon of the hero\'s journey.\n\nWe have almost entirely ignored Xehanort.\n\nHe is the impetus for all of the anger and anguish in Sora\'s life.\n\nAnd so he deserves a wheel as well.\n\nWe have to start at the very beginning of Xehanort.\n\nAnd that starts in stage one of all villains.\n\nYou have to be contacted by a future version of yourself.\n\nThat brings us to stage two.\n\nIt gives you the ability to time travel.\n\nAnd that\'s what this means.\n\nThis special string just shows that they can go wherever they want to in time.\n\nStep three, you need to learn about a great power.\n\nThis is when Xehanort first discovers Kingdom Hearts and all of the power it could hold.\n\nWhat do you do after you find out about that power?\n\nYou nort a boy.\n\nOnce you\'ve got that boy under your possession, time to get real into unethical science.\n\nThat\'s when you\'re going to learn all about Kingdom Hearts and how to release people\'s hearts.\n\nThat means you can become a guinea pig yourself, therefore creating two versions of yourself.\n\nA Nobody and a Heartless.\n\nBut are you happy with just those two versions of yourself?\n\nYou shouldn\'t be!\n\n\'Cause you\'re a villain.\n\nThat\'s right, it\'s time for nort boy redux.\n\nStage eight.\n\nThis is when Ansem, the Heartless version of Terra-Xehanort, the original norted boy\n\nform, takes control of Riku.\n\nAnd now that you\'re jazzed and ready to go, time to fail.\n\nYou do have to fail once, uh, in order to succeed later as a villain.\n\nBut don\'t let that failure get you down, it\'s time for stage 10.\n\nYou develop an organization to trick young boy into committing Heartless genocide in order to create\n\na new pseudo version of that great power you discovered back in stage three.\n\nAnd then you fail again.\n\nBut guess what!\n\nIt\'s time travel time.\n\nYour young self is gonna help you out by coming from over in step two to step 12.\n\nYou just do the same tenth step again, except instead of using other people, you use 13\n\nversions of your own self.\n\nWhich leads us to the thirteenth point in the tridecagon.\n\nThe villain\'s variable.\n\nYou\'re either gonna win, or you\'re gonna lose.\n\nThis is the thing that we were missing.\n\nThe villain\'s variable is what will tie together the rest of story.\n\nIt\'s what will help us understand what will happen in Kingdom Hearts 3.\n\nAnd judging by the villain\'s tridecagon, I can say that I don\'t believe Sora will seal\n\naway the darkness.\n\nIn fact I expect Xehanort to win...\n\nby norting Sora.\n\nAnd then think of the repercussions of this.\n\nDonald will kill Goofy by throwing him off a dock.\n\nRiku will start cutting his own bangs.\n\nKairi will continue to not matter.\n\nIt\'s so much more interesting.\n\nIt\'s the true way that this story should end.\n\nAnd I think this is what people want.\n\nThis is the modern hero\'s journey.\n\nThe true thing that all stories should follow from here on out.\n\nAs Utada Hikaru would say: Simple and clean.\n\nSo the next time someone tells you, "I don\'t understand Kingdom Hearts!"\n\nYou say, "Hey Bucko.\n\nI think what you don\'t understand is basic storytelling."\n\nBasic storytelling.\n\nDid that work?\n\nI don\'t know.\n\nAsk...\n\nAladdin.\n\nDid the memo work?\n\nWhy don\'t you ask Sebastian the crab. *sings Under the Sea*\n\nYou nort a boy.\n\n*laughing*\n\nPat (offscreen): Ohhh no. ', ' *cheerful music*\n\nKirby!\n\nThis pink puffball has been sucking his way through the denizens of Dream Land since 1992.\n\nHe has his own games, manga, tv series, and toys.\n\nIt’s safe to say he’s one of Nintendo’s most trusted mascots.\n\nBut he should not be trusted.\n\nThe problem with Kirby is that he is simultaneously Nintendo’s simplest and most powerful creature.\n\nThose two realities cannot coexist.\n\nHe is a life form with neither the ambition nor the intelligence to make decisions,\n\nand yet the world bends to his will.\n\nAlthough it appears that Kirby is just a vacuous pastel marshmallow,\n\nthere must be some hidden wisdom that grants him the power he wields.\n\nThere has to be.\n\nKirby’s incongruity is terrifying,\n\nbut that’s only because we are terrified of things we do not yet understand.\n\nAnd today, we are going to understand.\n\n"Scientia potentia est.” Knowledge is Power.\n\nHumankind’s attempts to harness the powers of the natural world\n\ncome from intense research and understanding of those powers.\n\nAnd yet Kirby is granted powers well beyond his station.\n\nWhat powers, you ask? Allow me to show you.\n\nI have created two columns here: Simplicity, and Power.\n\nWhat Kirby is, versus What Kirby can do.\n\nBy mapping the dichotomy of these two columns, we can peel back the facade of Kirby’s simplicity,\n\nand figure out what’s really going on.\n\nBecause, again, this is not normal.\n\nLet’s begin with simplicity.\n\nMost people know Kirby as that cute little round guy, but is there more to him?\n\nAccording to official, canonical information:\n\nno.\n\nDoes this sound like an apex predator?\n\nEven a bear enjoys a satisfying back-scratch.\n\nThis sounds like the lowest form of life,\n\nsomeone who is stuck on the base of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs.\n\nHe wakes up, eats his caloric intake for the day,\n\nand falls asleep watching The Great British Bake Off.\n\nAnd yet, over here on the power column...\n\nThe things Kirby eats are completely obliterated.\n\nNot just converted into something else, completely gone.\n\nKirby only cares about eating and sleeping.\n\nAnd yet, he gains no energy nor pleasure from consuming these things.\n\nInstead, he just lets them disappear.\n\nGone from this plane of existence.\n\nSo…\n\nwhat the fuck.\n\nKirby doesn’t speak a language beyond saying the words “Poyo,”\n\nand “Hi!”\n\nKirby mostly communicates via body language and grunts.\n\nEven toddlers are more communicative.\n\nBy all accounts, he is either incapable of, or uninterested in, speaking language.\n\nAnd yet Kirby is an incredibly skilled technician.\n\nWe see Kirby piloting mechs, and if anime is to believed,\n\nand I believe anime,\n\nthis can only be accomplished by gifted teens grappling with psychosexual ennui.\n\nHe can effortlessly turn himself into a fighter jet,\n\nsomething that only the most skilled air force engineers have mastered.\n\nHow can he understand these complex mechanical processes,\n\nwithout having the language skill to read a textbook\n\nor the "I fucking love science" facebook page?\n\nKirby’s origins are vague.\n\nLet me take a moment to move over to a different board so I can show you Kirby’s origin story.\n\nThere’s NOTHING HERE.\n\nVery little is known about Kirby’s origin.\n\nHe has no canonical species. He has no canonical age.\n\nMasahiro Sakurai, Kirby’s alleged creator,\n\nhas stated he does not remember how Kirby got his name.\n\nKirby was originally a placeholder sprite,\n\nset to be replaced by something....\n\nMore!\n\nBut no. Kirby survived. Kirby came from nothing.\n\nAnd Kirby is nothing.\n\nOr is he everything.\n\nBecause Kirby can be anything.\n\nHis copy ability gives him the powers and appearance of any creature he consumes.\n\nBut copy is a misnomer.\n\nHe does not duplicate his enemies.\n\nHe assimilates and replaces them.\n\nIn Smash, he takes the power of his foes, and then the foe is released as a sign of respect.\n\nBut in every other iteration of Kirby, the thing he consumes is destroyed in the process.\n\nDoes he absorb their DNA? Does he absorb their memories?\n\nIs he the keeper of their souls?\n\nAll of these abilities point to Kirby being intelligently designed, which we know is not the case.\n\nSakurai fucking woke up in a crop circle with the name “Kirby” carved into his arm.\n\nKirby has no emotional intelligence. No relationships.\n\nIn the anime, Kirby seems to harbor no ill will toward King Dedede or Escargoon,\n\nhis main two antagonists.\n\nHe faces baby birds and full battalions of soldiers with the same vacant grin.\n\nHe eats and destroys indiscriminately, but counts no one among his enemies.\n\nBut those who count him among theirs…\n\nare cosmic horrors.\n\nLook at this thing.\n\nLook at this thing!\n\nThese celestial powers probably have wants and needs far beyond our human comprehension,\n\nand yet they trouble themselves with the destruction of Kirby,\n\na barely living kickball.\n\nWhat do they see in Kirby that scares them?\n\nWhat could scare this?\n\nAnd the final simple evidence, Kirby is shaped like a friend.\n\nThis was the opening of Kirby’s Adventure. Let me show you something.\n\nWhat did you notice?\n\nThat’s right. For the entire time I was drawing this,\n\nI WASN’T INTERROGATING the true nature of Kirby.\n\nThis quote is cute and simple and a blatant misdirection.\n\nIt is a patronizing errand is meant to keep people like me from uncovering the truth.\n\nThe truth that Kirby possesses infinite power.\n\nAnd that is a quote.\n\nPlanet Robobot explicitly states that Kirby possesses infinite power.\n\nKirby can ride a star. Kirby can punch through a planet.\n\nKirby is the only being in the entirety of the universe that survived the Galeem cataclysm.\n\nA circle survived.\n\nTHIS SURVIVED.\n\nHOW?\n\n*deep breath*\n\nNow that we’ve addressed these two columns, it is time to bridge the gap.\n\nHow can we reconcile the two canonical truths of Kirby:\n\nthat he is both nothing and everything.\n\nHow can this sentient garbage bag accomplish so much?\n\nLet me tell you...\n\nI don’t know.\n\nI literally have no clue how this dumb fucking orb can have so much power.\n\nI have worked my whole life researching and gaining knowledge,\n\nand this dipshit sphere sleeps all day and has powers that gods fear.\n\nAnd that’s impossible.\n\nIt should be impossible.\n\nThere has to be an answer here and I don’t see it and that’s NOT FAIR.\n\nIf knowledge is power, then power should be knowledge,\n\nand Kirby is everything and he should know everything,\n\nand yet we know nothing!\n\nI can’t think in here.\n\nI’m going outside!\n\nHow do I get outside?\n\nKirby!\n\nThe mystery of this florid Dream Landian has baffled me,\n\nbut I\'ve taken a few months, and I\'ve collected my thoughts,\n\nand I’m back in the studio to deliver my findings.\n\nKirby’s incongruity is terrifying, but that’s only because we are terrified of things we do not yet understand.\n\nAnd today, for real,\n\nwe are going to understand.\n\nIf you’ll recall from our first exploration of the rosy nightmare,\n\nthe problem with Kirby is that he is both incredibly simple and incredibly powerful.\n\nIn the intervening five months, I’ve learned a few pieces of information that contradict a few of my points.\n\nFirst, Kirby can speak a language.\n\nThere was a Drama CD released in Japan in 1994 where Kirby speaks full sentences.\n\nBut in this, he says that a phone is “mysterious” and he doesn’t know how it works.\n\nAnd yet, he can pilot a mech.\n\nTwo, Kirby’s name does in fact have a backstory,\n\neven if Sakurai was too fuckin\' zooted to remember it.\n\nKirby was named after John Kirby, a lawyer who passed away last year,\n\nwho defended Nintendo’s right to copyright Donkey Kong back in the ‘80s.\n\nBut this doesn’t make the rest of Kirby\'s origin any less vague,\n\nand it doesn\'t change the fact that a creature cannot possibly embody both of these truths.\n\nBut that’s the problem.\n\nI’ve been thinking of Kirby as a creature.\n\nConsider, for a moment, Moby Dick.\n\nYou might receive this book in your English class and say,\n\n"Hell yeah! A big ol’ whale?\n\nI can’t wait to see Ahab level up and hit that big boy right in his weak points.\n\nAnd sure, he puts his harpoon up in Moby D’s flanks,\n\nbut spoiler alert!\n\nAhab gets got,\n\neven though he’s been grinding for, like, years\n\nand Pale Whale\'s just a dipshit fish with a thing for sailor feet.\n\nAnd so you say this to Ms. Mahoney and she’s like,\n\n“Brian, don’t you get it? The whale is a metaphor for…\n\nsomething,”\n\nand then you write that on your final exam and you pass the class.\n\nThis is what I like to call “The Bookman’s Bluff.”\n\nIt’s when an author creates something, and people are like,\n\n“Hey, that doesn’t make sense,”\n\nbut then the author says,\n\n“Well, it does make sense if you consider it’s actually a metaphor.”\n\nHere, I believe that Sakurai is pulling a Bookman’s Bluff.\n\nKirby, like Moby Dick, doesn’t make sense as a creature,\n\nbut he will make sense as a metaphor.\n\nSo what does Kirby symbolize?\n\nLet’s take a look at some common metaphors.\n\nLet\'s start with the seven deadly sins since everyone and their mother is basing characters on them.\n\nUnfortunately, none of them really make sense for Kirby.\n\nWrath, no way. Greed, he’s not in it for the money.\n\nI\'m gonna skip over lust.\n\nYou could make an argument for Gluttony because he eats a lot.\n\nSloth, he sleeps a lot. And Envy, he\'s constantly copying other people.\n\nBut he never does it with any malice. Kirby does these things haphazardly,\n\nwithout any sense of what he\'s doing.\n\nAnd then there’s Pride.\n\nNow, pride is the sin from which all other sins arise,\n\nand its punishment in hell is being broken upon the wheel,\n\nbut Kirby is a wheel, so that ain’t gonna work.\n\nBut Kirby might symbolize someone else’s pride...\n\nThe Hubris of Humanity.\n\nThink about it.\n\nHas humanity ever paused to consider that perhaps our endless consumption\n\nmay not be a good move for the world as a whole?\n\nHave we altered our course or simply continued to eat and sleep and copy others\n\nwithout any thought of the repercussions?\n\nIn fact, perhaps we can go one step further. Kirby is a metaphor for capitalism!\n\nDoes our capitalist society assimilate and destroy?\n\nAbsolutely!\n\nTechnical and cultural appropriation are two of capitalism’s most trusted tools.\n\nWhen it comes to a lack of emotional intelligence,\n\ncapitalism makes people willing to suck in and obliterate anything,\n\nfriend or foe, nation or natural wonder, so long as it makes money.\n\nIs capitalism’s enemy a cosmic horror?\n\nWhat could be more cosmically horrifying to a capitalist society\n\nthan a guy called Marx.\n\nKIRBY IS A METAPHOR FOR CAPITALISM.\n\nSure, capitalism can sometimes be more cruel in its intentions than Kirby can manage.\n\nThat is... I\'ll take that.\n\nUh, also, it sure as hell feels like it could burn out at any second,\n\nso the infinite power thing: not 100% true.\n\nUm, and,\n\nvery-it\'s a-it’s hard to describe capitalism as being shaped like a friend…\n\nand the whole eating and sleeping only is...\n\nit doesn’t really make sense \'cause we have a hyper fixation on productivity and that being tied to worth…\n\nso that doesn\'t...\n\nThis is not a very good metaphor, is it?\n\nIn fact, most of these metaphors are bullshit.\n\nEspecially this one.\n\nI thought I could take five months and pause and contemplate,\n\nand then I\'d come back, and I\'d have the perfect explanation for the dichotomy of Kirby,\n\nbut nothing has changed.\n\nThis horrifying bolus slips through my fingers again.\n\nMaybe I’m just not good at this...\n\nJenna, can you...\n\nI need you to keep my papers and push pins safe. I’m gonna go away for awhile…\n\nI\'m gonna find Kirby.\n\nJenna: Okay. Good luck bud.\n\nI went to the woods because I wished to front only the essential facts of Kirby.\n\nI wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life,\n\njust as Kirby might suck a Waddle Dee into his gullet.\n\nI’ve been at it for a while now.\n\nJudging by the length of my beard, I’ve been living out here for 2, maybe 3 years?\n\nThere are no pin boards in the forest.\n\nI don’t have three cameras to catch my every side glance.\n\nThey don\'t teach you th...\n\nIt’s just me. And nature,\n\nwhich has reduced me to my base instincts.\n\nI only care about finding food and shelter,\n\neating and sleeping.\n\nI am become Kirby.\n\nI wish I could say this has given me a clear mind, but no,\n\nnature has broken me.\n\nI am confounded by it.\n\nAnd we are terrified of things we do not yet understand.\n\nKirby is nature!\n\n...I thought, after spending my first day out in the woods.\n\nSure, nature’s origins are still murky,\n\nand what is evolution if not a really, really slow form of Kirby’s copy ability?\n\n*inhaling*\n\nAnd much like Kirby, Nature is neither cruel nor kind:\n\nit doles out boons and punishments indiscriminately.\n\nFor every delicious handful of berries,\n\nit also gives a completely unrelated bout of diarrhea.\n\nBut it took me only a few days to realize that this was another dead end.\n\nNature doesn’t destroy matter, or possess infinite power,\n\nand its enemy is not a cosmic horror,\n\nit’s us.\n\nI\'m sorry for using so much paper.\n\nSo I went back to the proverbial drawing board and have been stuck there ever since.\n\nNature is still terrifying to me.\n\nAnd it is certainly not shaped like a friend.\n\nHow can Kirby live like this and stay so joyful?\n\nHow can he only care about his base needs and conquer any enemies that come before him?\n\nI can’t conquer anything,\n\nnot even the mystery of a character from a children’s game.\n\nAll I can do is tumble listlessly through the wood,\n\nlike a star spat from Kirby’s maw.\n\n*waves crashing*\n\nI awake one morning upon the shore of a strange sea.\n\nI do not know where I am, nor how I came to be here.\n\nThe sea stretches endlessly in front of me,\n\nrevealing the gentle, Kirby-like curve of the planet,\n\nand I finally understand.\n\nI was so focused on investigating the inner machinations of this bulbous boy\n\nthat I never asked why I was investigating.\n\nI am tormented with an everlasting itch for things to mean something,\n\nbut Kirby didn’t need an explanation,\n\nI did.\n\nThere is no bullet point or fan wiki entry.\n\nKirby is not nature or a metaphor.\n\nKirby doesn’t need a dark backstory or a logical rationale.\n\nKirby is just Kirby.\n\nAs I stand here watching the waves lap against the sand\n\nmiles away from civilization,\n\nI realize I’m not simply standing on the edge of the ocean, but the edge of the world.\n\nA world I’ve accepted without knowing its hidden meaning.\n\nPerhaps there is no hidden meaning.\n\nPerhaps it’s better that way.\n\nPerhaps it’s time for me to go home.\n\n“First you draw a circle,\n\nthen you dot the eyes.\n\nAdd a great big smile,\n\nand presto, it’s Kirby.”\n\nKirby is an extremely strong circle,\n\nand that’s all the explanation I need.\n\nUnfortunately,\n\nthe same CANNOT BE SAID FOR DIDDY KONG.\n\nWHO GAVE HIM A GUN? DID HE BUILD THE JETPACK?\n\nTHAT DOESN\'T MAKE ANY SENSE, HE\'S A MONKEY, WHAT IS HE...\n\n*suit ripping* Ahhh yeah!\n\nThis is satisfying. If you get in on this, you want to...\n\nPat: Yeah.\n\nBrian: Roll... just put that in a bunch of dirt right now.\n\nI\'m gonna roll around a little bit.\n\n*you hear a bunch of scrounging around*\n\n*shirt ripping* Brian: Ohhhh incredible!\n\nPat: Are we gonna ride on the train like this to Coney Island?\n\nBrian: Yeah maybe! ', " Mario!\n\nHe can jump, he can dance,\n\nand he can successfully avoid conviction for war crimes.\n\nIt seems like the only thing he can’t do is settle down and just enjoy life for a bit.\n\nMario has been cleaning up messes in the Mushroom Kingdom and beyond since 1981.\n\nThat makes him almost 40 years old.\n\nMost 40-year-olds I know are paying off a mortgage, buying a Peloton,\n\nand desperately trying not to become their parents.\n\nBut Mario is still out there,\n\ngrinding at the same job,\n\nand also, every other job.\n\nDoesn’t Mario deserve some time off?\n\nDoesn’t he get a chance to kick up his heels?\n\nEnjoy a tropical drink while visiting the ol’ timeshare?\n\nAnd more specifically, hasn’t he made enough coins to let him coast for the rest of his life?\n\nThat’s why I’m here to give him a little financial advice…\n\n*ding!*\n\nAnd figure out when Mario can retire.\n\n*chalk board wheeling in*\n\nThank you both.\n\nWhy should Mario retire?\n\nYou might say “Mario loves his job,\n\nand when you love what you do, you never work a day in your life,”\n\nbut that's bullshit.\n\nI love what I do, and let me tell you something…\n\nI’ve worked some days.\n\n*threatening bass noise*\n\nI personally can’t wait to retire.\n\nAs soon as I hit 50, I'm gonna be out there on the beach,\n\npina colada in one hand, sci-fi novel in the other,\n\nsoaking up mother nature's cosmic rays.\n\nBut Mario has a history of risk-taking behavior, and\n\nit's possible he's planning to live fast, die young, and leave a beautiful, beautiful corpse.\n\nThat said, he’s made it out of every scrape so far,\n\nand ground pounding at age 86 is hard on the hips.\n\nMario needs a backup plan.\n\nNow, I’m not here to tell Mario how to live his life\n\n*ding*\n\nbut I can take a look at his finances\n\nand figure out when he’ll have enough money to finally hand Peach his resignation letter.\n\nFoolish ol’ me thought that I could just google “how much money do you need to retire”\n\nand there'd be a link that says “a million bucks,”\n\nbut no.\n\nTurns out that everyone needs a different amount to retire based on what you’re used to.\n\nIf you’re making millions every year, you’re gonna need a lot more to retire,\n\nbecause how else are you gonna support your dipshit failson’s bad business ideas?\n\nBut with all of the retirement calculators online, I was getting a little overwhelmed,\n\nso I decided to reach out to a qualified financial advisor.\n\n- Hi, my name’s Nate Choe, I’m a certified financial planner with Northwestern Mutual,\n\nand I basically help people answer questions about money.\n\n- That’s exactly what I need you to do today.\n\nThis call is not about me, um, I feel like I’m in a great spot right now in terms of my finances,\n\nbut I have some worries about my good friend, Mario.\n\nI was looking online to see if there was, like, just a number of money you need in order to retire,\n\nand it turns out that that’s not a thing that exists.\n\nHow do I figure out how much money you need to retire?\n\n- Yeah, yeah, um, there are a lot of different things that you’d need to know.\n\nAt the most basic level, you need to know how many years you’re going to spend in retirement.\n\nSo basically, when you’re gonna retire, and at what age you’re going to die.\n\n- So I have know, I have to be able to, uh,\n\nto just discern when I’m willing to croak, is what you’re saying.\n\n- Exactly, yes, you have to calculate a death at some point.\n\n- Alright. What if I’m never gonna die.\n\n- *chuckling* Then you’re never going to be able to retire.\n\nAnd then you’ll need to know how much money you’re going to spend every single month…\n\n- Okay…\n\n- And then Nate listed off a bunch of other very important pieces of retirement info\n\nand I paid close attention.\n\n- Got it, okay.\n\nI figure out how much money he’s gonna need per month, and then I’ll work backward from that,\n\nbased on how much money he can accrue, and then that will be how I can figure out when he can retire?\n\n- That work backwards model is actually what we do in the industry,\n\nbut we have to offset what he has against inflation as well.\n\n- Is there a minimum amount of money per month that you suggest people have for retirement?\n\n- Yeah, typically, what we’re talking about, like, the average American,\n\nit’s going to be about three thousand dollars a month, of today’s dollars.\n\n- I feel like Mario is a very humble man,\n\nand so I don’t think he’s going to need more than 3k a month, um,\n\njust to make it easier for me.\n\nSo now that I’ve got a basic gist of the information I need to calculate Mario’s retirement age,\n\nit’s time to collect the information.\n\nLet’s start with something easygoing\n\nand figure out when Mario's gonna die.\n\nTo keep things simple, we’ll assume that Mario was born the year he first made a game appearance.\n\nThis might not be perfectly accurate, but it would make him almost 39 years old,\n\nand that feels pretty right for a strangely smooth-skinned mustachioed man.\n\nThough current male life expectancy is around 80 years old,\n\nI personally can’t come to grips with the fact that Mario is halfway through his life,\n\nso I’ll be generous and say he’ll die at 90.\n\nHe’s spry.\n\nIn order to retire, Mario is going to need a monthly budget of at least three thousand US dollars,\n\nbut he uses coins.\n\nTons and tons of people have tried to figure out, how much a coin would be worth in US dollars,\n\nbut most of them have been thinking about coins as a solid gold object.\n\nJudging by the amount of coins you need to purchase simple objects in the Mushroom Kingdom,\n\nit seems like coins are not really worth that much.\n\nUsing Super Mario RPG as our guideline for a coin’s purchasing power,\n\nthe cheapest items are a mushroom and able juice: 4 coins a pop.\n\nShirt and pants are the cheapest nonconsumable items at 7 coins each.\n\nI wanted to compare these with the most expensive items in Super Mario RPG,\n\nbut I don’t think I can figure out the real world price of a fire bomb\n\nwithout getting put on a watch list.\n\nAfter doing some heavy research, I settled on a conversion rate of 1 coin to 8 US Dollars.\n\nGiven our 3k figure for retirement,\n\nthat just means Mario needs 375 coins a month, right?\n\nWRONG.\n\nSuper Mario RPG came out in 1996, and we haven’t accounted for inflation.\n\nThat’s why we gotta compare these prices to similar items Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga,\n\nwhich came out seven years later.\n\nI built my Mushroom Price Index on these six items, and just from a cursory glance,\n\nit’s obvious that the prices have gone up.\n\nBut to figure out by how much, we gotta head back to algebra two.\n\nThe pert equation!\n\nIt's something I learned about a very long time ago,\n\nand I’m pretty sure it’s used to figure out compounding interest.\n\nBasically, I gotta plug in some prices and do some natural logs and\n\nwhatever else the internet tells me to do,\n\nand it will leave me with an annual inflation rate for that item.\n\nThen I just gotta average out the rates and it’ll leave me with a workable annual inflation rate\n\nfor the Mushroom Kingdom as a whole.\n\nSo I’ll just go ahead and do that math in my head real quick.\n\n*thinking music*\n\nThank you, Clayton.\n\nNow, rounding that number up, that’s an average annual inflation rate of about 15% per year.\n\nWhich is… really high.\n\nThe US Federal Reserve tries to keep inflation at a healthy 2%,\n\nwhereas the Mushroom Kingdom Federal Reserve doesn’t exist\n\ndue to aggressive lobbying by Wario.\n\nIn order to understand this a bit better, I googled Mario hyperinflation,\n\nand I got some exciting search results\n\nthat were ultimately unhelpful.\n\nBut from what I gather, this means that if Mario spends 100 coins to buy a shirt this year,\n\nnext year, he'll have to spend a little more than 115 for the same shirt.\n\nIf inflation stayed the same from when Superstar Saga came out in 2003,\n\nwe can assume that by 2020, a simple mushroom is going to cost 128 coins.\n\nA pair of entry level pants will cost 2049 coins.\n\nSo that original 1-to-8 conversion rate doesn’t really make sense anymore.\n\nUsing those same 2020 price comparisons,\n\nthe conversion rate is more like 36 coins to 1 US Dollar.\n\nIf Mario retired today, he would need 108,000 coins per month.\n\n*MAMMA MIA!*\n\nBut let’s remember that Mario has been doing this for a long time. He’s definitely got a little something...\n\n... away. So I talked to Nate about his job and ways he might be saving money.\n\n- He has a bit of a strange job. He’s technically a plumber, I guess, in title?\n\n- Is he part of, like, the plumber’s union? Does he have a pension?\n\n- So I, I, I would be willing to bet he doesn’t have a pension just because, uh,\n\nI think he might be the only plumber?\n\nHe’s not being employed by anyone, necessarily. He’s just doing it and then finding his payment along the way.\n\n- Okay, so it sounds like he’s almost, like, a freelancer.\n\nIf he’s not getting W-2 income he can’t save into things like 401ks or Roth IRAs.\n\n- Now, when you say Roth IRA, what is that?\n\n- It’s a way to save for retirement.\n\nUm,\n\nyou know, as a young person you should definitely be doing one, trying to max it out every single year.\n\nIt’s crucial for, for retirement.\n\n- When…\n\nBut when you say crucial, do you…\n\ndo you mean optional?\n\nSo, maybe Mario doesn’t have a Rough IRA or a 4-in-1 Cake or whatever,\n\nbut no one has those. I don’t, and I’m well on my way to that beach chair in Boca!\n\nAnd the fact is that Mario can get a lot of coins in his games.\n\nHow else could he spend so much on go-karting and tennis?\n\nIn the most recent Mario games, the coin counter can only go up to 9,999,\n\nwhich is the maximum amount you can store in a mattress.\n\nSo let’s assume that Mario has been saving 10,000 coins every year since the release of Mario Odyssey.\n\nWe can assume that since he’s not in a union, he isn’t getting any raises to offset inflation.\n\nSo to finally figure out when Mario can retire, we need to know much money he’ll need every year before his death.\n\nFor example, if he lives to 90 years old, he’ll need 2.7 billion coins.\n\nWhich is the cost of living for just one year.\n\nBut we have to remember that he's been saving 10,000 coins for 54 years,\n\nwhich means that he would have 540 thousand coins saved up… Which is…\n\npoint zero two percent\n\nof what he needs to retire for just one year before his death.\n\nAnd actually, if the monthly cost of living is already 108 thousand coins,\n\nhe's gonna be unbelievably deep in debt…\n\nWhich is actually what Nate told me, via text.\n\nMario can never retire.\n\nYou know what, that’s bonkers though, because there's...\n\nthere’s no way that, you know, inflation's gonna stay that high for that long.\n\nIn fact, in later Mario and Luigi RPGs, the prices are the same or lower.\n\nSo let’s just assume that from here on out the inflation rate stays a healthy 2%.\n\nAnd you know what, let’s assume that Mario can save more than 10,000 coins a month.\n\nIn New Super Mario Bros. 2, the counter maxes out at one less than 10 million coins.\n\nGranted, this is an outlier, and a ridiculous one at that,\n\nbut so is spending 2.7 billion coins just to survive at age 90.\n\nThere’s no way you could spend that much on Werther’s Originals.\n\nSo let’s say he's saving 10 million coins a year since age 31,\n\nwhich, might I point out, is over a quarter of a million US Dollars.\n\nNow if we just add up the cost of living of each year leading up to 90,\n\nwe can see that Mario will have saved enough money to chill out on his boat at age…\n\n77.\n\nWhich is...\n\nis just one year below the average American male life expectancy…\n\n*I'M-A TIRED!*\n\nOkay, you know what,\n\njust for fun, let's just throw some random numbers in here, just to... just for...\n\njust to see, you know, just wheaa- just for fun!\n\nLet’s say Mario is starting to save money at, ppffff, I don’t know, my age, 26.\n\nThe inflation rate can stay the same, 2%,\n\nand let's just say that the coin ratio is actually just 1-to-1 with US dollars,\n\nso just he needs 3,000 coins today in order to retire.\n\nAnd, and you know what, let’s, let's say he can save….\n\nuhhh, psshhh, 10% of an average video producer’s salary in New York City.\n\nSomething completely random like that.\n\nAssuming Mario lives to the ripe old age of 90,\n\nwe can just plug these figures into the equation\n\nand figure out that Mario will be kickin' back on the white sands,\n\nboombox blastin' Jimmy Buffett at the youthful retirement age of...\n\n88?\n\nAre you fucking kidding me?\n\nNononono... That can’t be right…\n\nBecause if Mario can’t retire,\n\nthen that would mean that I wo-\n\n*uncomfortable silence*\n\nWill you excuse me for a moment…\n\n*tropical music playing in the background*\n\n*Another day in paradise!*\n\n*The sun is shining bright!*\n\n*People laugh and people smile, 'cause everything feels alright!*\n\nIn order to understand this a little better, I googled Mario hyperinfla- *laughing* I just,\n\nI'm sorry, I'm just accepting this now. I'm just accepting what I'm saying. ", ' The Mega Man robot masters were not always evil.\n\nIn fact, most were mechanized workers, created specifically to make life on Earth more efficient\n\nand wonderful.\n\nAND THEN THAT MASSIVE DONGER,\n\nDR. WILY, TURNED ‘EM ON US!\n\nSo Mega Man destroyed them, and the world was saved.\n\nBut... just how useful were these robots?\n\nAnd were they useful enough to chance a robot uprising?\n\nWhat if someone ranked every single Mega Man robot master from most to least useful to\n\nsee which ones were really worth the risk.\n\nSomeone should try to do that.\n\nIt’s me.\n\nI’m the one who’s going to do that.\n\nBefore I get started on the gradient of worth it to not worth it, I’m gonna talk\n\nabout the protagonists, or “the good guys” even though some of them aren’t specifically good.\n\nA lot of these robots were built to be sentient for the sake of being sentient, and I do not\n\nfeel at all qualified to discuss the philosophical implications of that.\n\nSo I’m gonna put ‘em over here.\n\nMega Man.\n\nMega Man X.\n\nMega Man red.\n\nThey’re all over here.\n\nI’m not gonna touch that.\n\nSo what kind of robots are good when they’re sentient?\n\nI think that it’s things humans cannot do.\n\nThings that perhaps only a robot could do.\n\nOne that can think for itself would be pretty worthwhile.\n\nSo let’s start with those ones.\n\nThe ones that are good.\n\nNumber one: Chill Man.\n\nChill Man is a recent robot master who was built to help stop global warming.\n\nAnd heaven knows we need that.\n\nDefinitely worthwhile.\n\nNext is another cold friend: Freeze Man.\n\nFreeze Man was built to make a non-polluting energy.\n\nHe would make that energy by splitting average temperatures\n\ninto hot temperatures and cold temperatures.\n\nI’m choosing to think of that as something like nuclear fission as opposed to choosing\n\nto think of it as dumb.\n\nCommando Man.\n\nTerrible name, but he was actually a minesweeping robot.\n\nOne of the first gens, Elec Man.\n\nHe controlled nuclear power plants.\n\nHe could help make sure the nuclear power plant was shut down in case anything bad ever\n\nhappened to one.\n\nHopefully it won’t!\n\nSsssssSTAR MAN!\n\nHe was built to explore the universe.\n\nHumans are real squishy, really, when you think about it.\n\nIt might be nice to have a man going out into the stars, a Star Man.\n\nAlso in his flavor text, he’s apparently a romantic and, like, loves poetry, and that’s\n\nwhat we need out in the stars.\n\nWhile he’s up there, Galaxy Man is helping figure out the trajectories.\n\nSplash Woman!\n\nShe’s super useful because she goes and helps shipwrecked sailors, or just people\n\nlost at sea.\n\nI feel like she’d do a better job than, I dunno, the Coast Guard or whatever.\n\nNot that I’m shitting on the Coast Guard.\n\nThey do do good…\n\nI’m digging myself in a hole.\n\nWait, where’d Toad Man go?\n\n*worry about Toad Man*\n\nWhere’s my guy Toad Man?\n\nToad Man.\n\nHe irrigates crops during drought.\n\nVery useful.\n\nWhy’d they make him a toad?\n\nIce Man.\n\nI swear we’ve got a lot of cold people up here at the front.\n\nHe’s built specifically to do human-like tasks in cold weather.\n\nSo he’s good!\n\nMore cold friends.\n\nBlizzard Man.\n\nThere to help monitor the weather in arctic environments.\n\nLooks and names can be deceiving, and Junk Man is super important.\n\nJunk Man was built so he could find useable robot parts that have been left out.\n\nThink about how much electronic waste we make.\n\nIt would be great if something could go dig through all of our trash and find the useable\n\ncircuit boards.\n\nThat’s important.\n\nHornet Man.\n\nWe’ve done some shit to bees y’all.\n\nHe pollinates the flowers.\n\nWould be very useful if we continue to keep doing shit to bees.\n\nAnd finally, we’ve got Cloud Man and Tornado Man.\n\nThey both are actually useful for, uh, controlling the weather when things are bad.\n\nI’m gonna put Cloud Man in front of Tornado Man because Tornado Man, uh, was, was built\n\nto stop tropical storms.\n\nWhich is not what a tornado is.\n\nHe needs a different name.\n\nThere we go.\n\nThese ones I would say are worth the risk.\n\nWe still have like 180 more to go.\n\nWe got a bunch of construction robots next.\n\nWe’ll start with everyone’s favorite: Guts Man.\n\nImagine there’s a line right here.\n\nMaybe I’ll put it in in after effects.\n\nThat might be too much work.\n\nI’m probably not gonna do that.\n\nGood ones.\n\nNow we’re into construction zone.\n\nGuts Man comes first because he’s a civil engineer.\n\nHe’s not only strong and can lift big rocks, but he can build bridges probably.\n\nWe’ve got Aqua Man and Pump Man.\n\nBoth of them are used for water filtration.\n\nI’m gonna put Aqua Man in front of Pump Man because Pump Man’s flavor text explains\n\nthat sometimes he’ll volunteer to wash off graffiti,\n\nand no one likes a narc.\n\nBomb Man: bombs.\n\nGround Man: excavation.\n\nBlock Man: makes blocks.\n\nConcrete Man: concrete.\n\nNeedle Man: needles.\n\nI guess it’s drilling.\n\nDrill Man: also drilling.\n\nBit Man, from the DOS game.\n\nHe is also a driller.\n\nYou think that after the first two went bad… they would’ve stopped making drill robots,\n\nright?\n\nOil Man DOS.\n\nHe does oil… things.\n\nHard Man.\n\n*trying to keep it together*\n\nHe doesn’t actually have a, um, flavor text explanation for what he is other than that\n\nhe is very heavy.\n\nSo I am assuming that he is for ground leveling.\n\nUm.\n\nBut maybe he’s just big?\n\nImpact Man: piling.\n\nCut Man: tree cutting.\n\nTorch Man DOS: welding.\n\nFuse Man: electrical equipment management.\n\nOil Man: keeping things oiled.\n\nSpark Man: making sparks!\n\nI think he actually charges things.\n\nFire Man.\n\nHe was made to incinerate trash.\n\nBond Man.\n\nHe was supposed to be in the first game until they realized… he was just glue.\n\nStone Man.\n\nI assume bricks, but actually they only say that he hangs out with Guts Man, so maybe\n\nhe’s just moral support.\n\nFlame Man.\n\nHe generates thermal power.\n\nBut also he’s powered by thermal power?\n\nWhich seems recursive.\n\nAnd also impossible.\n\nJewel Man.\n\nHe not only mines the jewels but he polishes them.\n\nFinally, in the construction, it’s Slash Man.\n\nHe was specifically made to cut down trees so that you could build SECRET bases.\n\nI don’t know why they insisted on saying it was for secret bases.\n\nThat seems like a waste of a robot.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I don’t think we needed to make these ones sentient, because\n\nyou know what, Hard Man?\n\nI think steamrollers were doing just fine.\n\nNow we’re getting into a category I like to call…\n\nSure???\n\nThey’re not necessarily bad.\n\nI just think we could probably do without Wind Man, who apparently helps with the harvest…\n\nwith fans.\n\nAstro Man, who just works in a planetarium.\n\nGravity Man.\n\nHe can control gravity which could be useful?\n\nDive Man.\n\nHe was built to catch fish with torpedoes.\n\nThey made him look like a submarine and they gave him torpedoes.\n\nFeel like they should’ve seen this coming.\n\nSolar Man.\n\nNow he investigates solar things, I guess.\n\nHe also apparently developed an exercise routine.\n\nI don’t know why they needed to put that in the flavor text, but it definitely put\n\nhim in the “Sure???” category.\n\nTop Man.\n\nI’ll give ya…\n\nI’ll give you a guess about what he does.\n\nDid you guess “explore other planets?”\n\nBecause yeah, that’s what he was designed for.\n\nWhy the FUCK is he a top?\n\nGod these are all so good.\n\nWe’re getting into the categories where I can’t stop laugh…\n\n*clears throat* *deep breath*\n\nSerious.\n\nSnake Man.\n\n*laughter from everyone in the studio*\n\nHe, uh, was supposed to explore other planets\n\nthat had crevasses.\n\nAnd he’s a snake.\n\nGyro Man.\n\nHe was supposed to be a really good plane, but then Wily ran out of money, so they just\n\nstuck a propellor on his back.\n\nPlant Man manages plants.\n\nPharaoh Man.\n\nOnly supposed to explore ruins.\n\nBlast Man.\n\nHe manages fireworks.\n\nFireworks are dangerous.\n\nDon’t play with fireworks.\n\nBut also, maybe, don’t make a robot to play with them.\n\nI love Nitro Man.\n\nI’m gonna be honest, I do feel kind of bad putting him into the “Sure???” category.\n\nUh, because Nitro Man was built specifically to do motorcycle stunts in movies.\n\nThe thing I really love about Nitro Man is that he’s the president of a stunt robot club.\n\nWhich I think is just wonderful.\n\nHe’s still not useful.\n\nHere’s where thing get a little bit difficult for me.\n\nBurst Man was built to be a guard.\n\nI’m not sure about robot, highly armed guards.\n\nBut since he was specifically a guard…\n\nI keep saying specifically.\n\nI figure, like, that’s still defensive, and so…\n\nI’ll put him here.\n\nBut it’s a good segue!\n\nIn the Mega Man games, not every robot was made by Dr. Wily or Dr. Light.\n\nAnd in fact, there were some robots that were made by other robots.\n\nOr were made extraterrestrially.\n\nOr were made specifically as a joke, like “I can’t find my keys, man!”\n\nI’m gonna put them kind of as the split in the middle to say, “Hey, these are nebulous,\n\nbut they’re definitely not good.”\n\nNow that we’ve got this hard line of good to bad, even though, to be honest, I think\n\nthat the line should be here.\n\nIt’s time for us to talk about the bad robots.\n\nJ.J. Abrams.\n\nSome of these robots were built specifically to murder.\n\nWe can all agree that that is bad.\n\nI’m gonna put all of these murder robots over on the very bad side.\n\nWe also have a bunch of characters that are Sonic robots.\n\nThat is an affront to nature.\n\nThey’re in the bad side, too.\n\nI also didn’t even print out all of the NetNavis from Mega Man Battle Network even\n\nthough I love those games because those were software built with the specific intention\n\nof being mean online.\n\nAnd that’s just Twitter.\n\nI do just want to point out Aircon Man, who was a robot sent from the future to destroy\n\nthe world.\n\nAnd he’s also an air conditioning unit.\n\nNow *kick* let’s get into the fun part.\n\nThese robots have absolutely no reason to be sentient.\n\nChemistry Man.\n\nHe’s from the new cartoon.\n\nHe apparently taught chemistry classes that were so boring, he put kids to sleep.\n\nAnd then he took it really personally, and decided to become evil.\n\nSheep Man.\n\nHe’s a shepard actually.\n\nTundra Man.\n\nBuilt to do similar things to all of the high echelon frozen people, but I’m including\n\nhim over here because he got really bored at his job and then decided to become\n\nan ice skater.\n\nThis is why you don’t make sentient robots, I guess.\n\nHypno Woman.\n\nShe was a therapist who hypnotized people into bad things.\n\nDJ Jazzy J4-8950…\n\nis a boombox.\n\nYou are a magnet.\n\nPlug Man charged electrical things.\n\nLike a plug could do.\n\nStrike Man sounds cool, but he’s just a baseball throwing machine.\n\nIt’s me.\n\nSpring Man can… jump?\n\nBright Man.\n\nBuilt to explore dark places.\n\nKinda like a FLASHLIGHT.\n\nCold Man’s a refrigerator.\n\nSeriously.\n\nSword Man.\n\nHe was developed to hold a sword that Wily stole from a place.\n\nHe’s not a sentient murder robot.\n\nHe’s a sentient picture frame.\n\nThings that don’t really need to be sentient?\n\nA vacuum.\n\nIt’s Dust Man.\n\nAlthough, Dust Man is quoted as saying, “Don’t let me suck more than I can handle!”\n\nSo you know what, actually, I take this back.\n\nHe’s more important than Chill Man.\n\nWe’ve already done the worthwhile ones.\n\nWe’ve talked about the construction ones.\n\nWe’ve talked about the ones that are “eh whaat uh sure w-okay thas fine.”\n\nWe have all of the ones that are alien.\n\nAnd we’ve got the ones that really didn’t need to be sentient.\n\nWe are left with the dregs of robotic society.\n\nI call this category…\n\nNO.\n\nWe’ll start with Crystal Man.\n\nHe was built to make crystals so that Dr. Wily could sell them for money.\n\nTurbo Man is a car.\n\nOr rather, he used to be a car, but then he was turned into turbo man.\n\nCharge Man.\n\nIs he a train?\n\nNo.\n\nBut he’s meant to camouflage as one.\n\nI think Dr. Wily’s just real into trains.\n\nYou know what I think about when I think of “Safety Operations Manager?”\n\nA big man full of magma.\n\nBuilt to make sure a plant kept safe, but also had a bunch of cauldrons full of boiling\n\nmagma in him.\n\nTime Man.\n\nHe’s a time machine.\n\nThat never goes well.\n\nAcid Man was built to be a chemist.\n\nWhat’s he good for, titrations?\n\nThat\'s a chemistry joke.\n\nCentaur Man.\n\nHe... was a tour guide.\n\nJust hire a 16 year old.\n\nLike, they need the job.\n\nShark Man DOS.\n\nShark Man DOS not need to exist.\n\nOh we’ve been doing this for like five hours.\n\n*CLAP CLAP*\n\nGoddamnit.\n\nMagic Man was built to be a magician in like a traveling circus sort of show.\n\nAnd then he was not turned evil, he just decided to conscript in King’s army because he wanted\n\nto show off.\n\nHere’s the big rule of thumb:\n\nmagicians are always evil.\n\nShade Man.\n\nHe looks like a vampire, doesn’t he?\n\nIt’s ‘cause he was built to look like one.\n\nHe was an animatronic robot in a haunted house.\n\nSomebody thought we should make that creepy animatronic robot sentient.\n\nPHEW remember how Centaur Man was a tour guide?\n\nWell so was Dynamo Man.\n\nBut they also made him constantly shoot off electricity.\n\nThat’s a bad tour guide.\n\nWhen they got into, like, the late game stages, they were just like, “I dunno, he’s a\n\ntour guide for a thing.”\n\nTorch Man was built to teach kids about fire safety in the woods.\n\nWhich is kind of like if Smokey the Bear\n\nwas CONSTANTLY ON FIRE.\n\nYou thought torch man was bad, let me tell ya about Burner Man, who was made, and I quote,\n\n“to bring harm to natural environments.”\n\nTechnically not murder.\n\nDefinitely bad.\n\nRemember how I said that a lot of these guys were tour guides?\n\nWell let me tell you about Blade Man.\n\nBuilt to show off an old castle full of swords.\n\nAnd also was a sword.\n\nTengu Man.\n\nMakes typhoons.\n\nHOOOKAY.\n\nWe’re at the final three here.\n\nWe’ve made it.\n\nAnd I’d say that these three really hammer home the point\n\nthat we should not be making sentient robots.\n\nWe’ve got Pirate Man.\n\nNot a murder robot.\n\nBut was built to do pirate things, like steal from other ships.\n\nHe does look cool as hell, though.\n\nThe second to last robot is not actually a terrible robot idea.\n\nBut it is a testament to just how trash human beings are.\n\nBounce Man was built to be a crash test dummy.\n\nSome asshole thought, “Hey, you know that thing we throw against a wall,\n\nmany miles-per-hour,\n\nevery single day,\n\nmultiple times a day?\n\nYou know what would make that better?\n\nIF IT COULD FEEL PAIN.”\n\nWHAT?\n\nLuckily, Bounce Man bounced from that job and then became an exercise instructor.\n\nHumans are trash.\n\nFinally, we’ve come to number one.\n\nClown Man.\n\nWho has ever watched a clown and thought to themselves,\n\n“Boy,\n\nI wish that thing never got tired!"\n\nClown Man is terrible, and I’m not saying that clowns are terrible.\n\nOkay?\n\nClowns serve their purpose.\n\nThey’re creepy.\n\nSometimes good.\n\nAnd…\n\nYou know what, I do take that back, clowns don’t serve a purpose.\n\nThat’s it.\n\nAll 200+ Mega Man robot masters, of which 15 are kind of okay.\n\nElon Musk: don’t get any ideas.\n\nThis is what man has wrought.\n\nYou will see these men in your nightmares.\n\nParticularly,\n\nSpring Man.\n\nJumping around.\n\nMake sure to like this video and subscribe to Polygon.\n\nAnd maybe leave a comment about what I should take care of next.\n\nBecause this… was bad. ', " Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.\n\nA game that takes heroic and villainous characters and forces them to form fraternal bonds in\n\nthe crucible of battle.\n\nBecause for those who can superbly smash, there is no better place to make a friend\n\nthan on the battlefield.\n\nThat’s the battlefield?\n\nSeriously?\n\nHow did they get permits for that?\n\nThat’s irresponsible.\n\nHi, I’m Brian David Gilbert, safety fan and bureaucratic wunderkind, please address\n\nme as such, and I’ve spent the last week and a half poring over the regulations of\n\nthe United States Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration,\n\nalso known as OSHA.\n\nI’m here to hold Super Smash Bros. to account.\n\nBecause when you take 70-plus beloved characters and force them to fight for our entertainment,\n\nthe least you can do is make sure the buildings are up to code.\n\nSo let's go ahead and FIND EVERY OSHA VIOLATION IN EVERY STAGE IN SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE.\n\nFirst, let’s explain the process, we have to start by choosing the correct regulations,\n\nand unfortunately, there isn’t a OSHA guide to “bloodsport,” so we're just gonna go\n\nwith construction, form 1926. 'Cause that's close enough.\n\nThe main thing to point out here is 1926.10 subsection A. I’ll read an excerpt for you\n\nso you can understand the basic concept of this video, and also the hellscape I had to slog through\n\nthe past week: “no contractor or subcontractor contracting for any part of the contract work”\n\n— that’s a real line — “shall require any laborer or mechanic employed in the performance\n\nof the contract to work in surroundings or under working conditions which are unsanitary,\n\nhazardous, or dangerous.”\n\nBasically, we’re here to build a safer experience for these characters, because when you walk\n\ninto an unknown space, I want the first question on your mind to be:\n\nThere are roughly 350 regulations in form 1926.\n\nHow many pages is that?\n\nAbout 684.\n\nDon’t worry, this is... this is just a visual aid.\n\nThey're all blank.\n\nI wouldn't waste paper like that.\n\n*thinks of the times he's wasted paper*\n\nMost of these regulations are irrelevant, but I\n\nstill had to read all 684 pages in order to know which ones to cut.\n\nWhich reminds me, this video idea came from commenter nshady16, so if you have an Unraveled\n\nidea, why don't you go ahead and leave me a comment.\n\nAnd thanks, nshady16, for making me read 684 pages of OSHA regulations,\n\nyou piece of garbage.\n\nSo I cut out all of the regulations that were just definitions, unrelated to stages, nonmandatory,\n\nredundant, or about personnel safety, because again, we’re not talking about hard hats,\n\nwe're talking about the stages themselves.\n\nUnfortunately, this also meant I had to cut out the entirety of subsection R.\n\nSteel Erection.\n\nSo there goes like 80% of the jokes in this video.\n\nOut of those 350 regulations, we’re left with 46 that actually relate to Smash Bros. stages.\n\nAnd again, we're just using the 103 stages you get when you boot up Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.\n\nAny any secret stages that pop up later, uh, that's probably just an underground fighting\n\nring, which is a different form of illegality.\n\nI’m gonna explain all of these OSHA violations as we go along.\n\nBut I just want you to keep in mind that there is a maximum penalty of $12,934 per OSHA violation.\n\nWe’ll get into that later.\n\nLet's get these OSHA violations on the board.\n\nBAM!\n\nThat's all the OSHA regulations we'll be discussing today.\n\nLet's start with the codes that pretty much every stage violates.\n\nGeneral safety and health provisions.\n\nI threw these three here because they're just dangerous in general and they don't have that\n\nmany other specific violations.\n\nSafety training and education.\n\nSeems like most of these people don't have safety training.\n\nEspecially in Moray Towers, where they literally shoot guns at you as you fly into the stage.\n\nRecording and reporting of injuries.\n\nWii Fit Studio is a gym, and so I would expect it to have paperwork if one of the gym members\n\ngets injured.\n\nUnfortunately, all of the gym members get injured.\n\nMeans of egress.\n\nIn most places, you have to have exit signs.\n\nAnd also, you have to have exits that don't involve plummeting to your death.\n\nEmployee emergency action plans.\n\nIt's very important to have an emergency action plan.\n\nEspecially if that emergency action plan is for if a mountaintop breaks off and slides\n\ninto the ocean.\n\nLook at this polar bear!\n\nHe has no fuckin' clue what's going on!\n\nAccident prevention, signs, and tags.\n\nJust put one wet floor sign anywhere, and I'll let it slide, okay?\n\nDuty to have fall protection.\n\nI mean uh... there's no fall protection.\n\nHow hard is it to put a harness on someone?\n\nGeneral requirements for stairways and ladders.\n\nAnything above 19 inches of elevation needs a staircase or a ladder.\n\nNot everyone can double jump.\n\nSanitation.\n\nMost of sanitation deals with potable versus non-potable water.\n\nBut a lot of it also deals with toilets, and I have yet to find a Smash Bros. stage that\n\nincludes a restroom.\n\nAnd I need to know where Donkey Kong pees.\n\nSo those ones pretty much everyone gets wrong.\n\nWhich means that we're at about 900 violations already.\n\nYikes!\n\nI feel a bit bad hitting all of these stages so hard, so I'll be a bit lenient for 1926.50.\n\nMedical services and first aid.\n\nYou have to provide first aid if someone has been hurt.\n\nAnd I'll just let the max tomato fulfill that requirement.\n\n451 states that you can't be using unstable objects as scaff.\n\nI'm gonna call all of these scaff 'cause there's no OSHA guideline for levitating floors.\n\nJumping on an awning causes it to break in Onett.\n\nThat's totally irresponsible.\n\n452 states that you need to have cross bracing.\n\nKongo Falls has so many things that aren't cross braced.\n\n453 is all about aerial lifts.\n\nYou need to stand firmly on the ground while it is moving.\n\nStop jumping!\n\nHousekeeping.\n\nYou gotta clean out the debris.\n\nI don't care that you've got a big dog running around behind you... put the... put the blocks\n\naway, that's debris!\n\nPut your toys away, honey!\n\nOccupational noise exposure.\n\nI'm ignoring the fact that they're fighting on top of a jet and instead thinking about\n\nhow loud those jets are.\n\nPop some earplugs in!\n\nGases, vapors, fumes, dusts, and mists.\n\nAll of these stages have clouds that you can stand on.\n\nWhich means they're incredibly dense.\n\nI don't care what it's made of, you shouldn't be breathing that in.\n\nIllumination.\n\nThose torches don't do anything.\n\nI'm gonna trip and stub my toe.\n\nVentilation.\n\nA lot of these stages need more airflow, better ventilation, but in Pictochat 2, there is\n\ntoo much ventilation in the form of this man who blows air.\n\nWho hired this man?\n\nI don't want him on my job site.\n\nHazardous waste operations and emergency response.\n\nIn Flat Zone X, someone spills oil and then just leaves it there.\n\n1926.150, 151, 152, and 154 are all about fire protection.\n\nMost of these regulations are pretty self explanatory.\n\nYou need to have a fire extinguisher.\n\nIt needs to be readily available.\n\nYou can't have ignition hazards hanging around.\n\nYou can't store more than 25 gallons of a flammable liquid in one place.\n\nBy the way, I'm including magma as a flammable liquid.\n\nI know they mean petroleum substances, but I think that's just a lack of imagination\n\non OSHA's part.\n\nBut 154 is all about temporary heating devices and how they shouldn't be kept in enclosed spaces.\n\nKind of like the charmander at the top of Saffron City.\n\nThe general requirements of electrical equipment.\n\nThey should be kept free from hazards that could cause death or harm to employees.\n\nThe large airships flying around you in these stages are not only electrical equipment,\n\nbut they are designed to harm and kill you.\n\nViolation.\n\nSpecific purpose equipment and installations.\n\nThis is all about elevators and escalators.\n\nWarioWare Inc. is one big elevator.\n\nYou don't need me to tell you it's broken.\n\nHelicopters.\n\nIs a Shy Guy a helicopter?\n\nI think so.\n\nYou're not supposed to be working underneath hovering craft.\n\nEven if they're bringing you fruit.\n\nConveyors.\n\nThat includes the stages that move back and forth and also all of the scrolling stages,\n\nwhich are the fastest way to die in Super Smash Bros. Tools and material shall be secured\n\nto prevent movement.\n\nDon't move equipment unless it's safe.\n\nThey're on a live racetrack.\n\nAll of the things are moving.\n\nMarine operations and equipment.\n\nYou have to have a lifering on a barge, and you have to provide a walkway between wharfs\n\nand boats.\n\nPaper Mario dissolves into a boat, but that doesn't count as a walkway.\n\nAnd there is not a single lifering at the Donkey Kong residence.\n\nI don't care how good you are at surfing, FUNKY KONG.\n\nUnderground construction.\n\nIf you're working underground, you're required to have a five-person rescue team on call.\n\nAnd although Super Smash Bros.\n\nUltimate does allow up to eight players.\n\nNone of them will save you.\n\nWorking on or near exposed energized parts.\n\nDoes a pokemon count as an energized circuit?\n\nAccording to OSHA, yes.\n\n1926.1052 is all about stairways.\n\nIf you have a stairway that rises more than 40 inches, you need to have a handrail.\n\nI imagine that Mario is about 40 inches tall, and this is at least four or five times his height.\n\nViolation.\n\nViolation.\n\nVIOLATION.\n\nVIOLATION!\n\nConfined spaces.\n\nThese are places where you are building where it's hard to get in and out of.\n\nYou need to specify the acceptable entry conditions.\n\nThere are no acceptable entry conditions into a space with a pit full of acid.\n\nDisposal of waste materials.\n\nIf you are dropping waste materials more than 25 feet, you need to be putting it in a chute.\n\nClock Tower: it is all debris that is falling infinitely.\n\nAnd it SHOULD be in a chute.\n\n850 is about preparing the demolition building.\n\nYou're supposed to remove any glass that could break.\n\nAnd in Dracula's Castle, Death flies through the window and breaks the glass.\n\nI couldn't give a shit about Death, you should've removed that stained glass first.\n\n853, you can't have a aggregate of more than 25% of a floor destroyed, and in Find Mii,\n\nhe destroys half of the stage.\n\nThe manual removal of floors.\n\nYou can destroy a lot of things in Shadow Moses Island, but you shouldn't be standing\n\nunder them.\n\nTower cranes.\n\nThere is only one stage that violates this.\n\nIt's literally the only stage with a tower crane, and ya FUCKED IT UP!\n\nExplosives should be stored in a magazine when they're not in use.\n\nAnd in Wrecking Crew, they're just available for you to punch until they explode.\n\nFiring the blast.\n\nYou shouldn't be in the proximity of the blast.\n\nNor should you be in the barrel that is causing the blast and shooting you off into space.\n\n1926.53 and 54 are about different types of radiation.\n\nIonizing, which is nuclear, and non-ionizing, which is like lasers.\n\nFinal Destination is just flying around through random parts of space.\n\nThere is no protection.\n\nYou should be less worried about getting punched into oblivion and more worried about the cancers.\n\nIn Gamer, your mom fires lasers at you when she sees you gaming.\n\nI'm not here to discuss her qualifications, but you are not allowed to fire those lasers\n\nat employees.\n\nJUST LET ME GAME, MOM!\n\nLadders.\n\nSuzaku Castle?\n\nYou thought you could get away with that shitty-ass ladder?\n\nThose ladder rungs need to be uniform.\n\nThey need to be evenly spaced.\n\nThey need to not be broken.\n\nI know that ladder is there for aesthetic purposes, but THAT IS A VIOLATION, SUZAKU\n\nCASTLE.\n\nYOU CANNOT HIDE YOUR LADDERS FROM ME.\n\nThat leaves us with one stage.\n\nThe one that has violated the most regulations.\n\nBut I want to point out Boxing Ring.\n\nThe only stage that is OSHA compliant.\n\nIt's almost as if it was built to allow people to fight in it safely.\n\nSakurai, I know you worked so hard on this game, and I appreciate it so much, but you\n\ncould have stopped at just one stage.\n\nYou SHOULD have STOPPED at JUST ONE STAGE.\n\nFinally, weighing in at 23 OSHA violations, it's 75m.\n\nI'm not 100% sure if this had so many violations just because it is a construction site, so\n\nit was easier for me to find all of the flaws with it.\n\nObviously, Brinstar is probably more dangerous, but I don't know how to categorize Mother Brain.\n\nThe thing that pushed it over the edge was material hoists, personnel hoists, and elevators.\n\nThey need to be enclosed at all times.\n\nPeople can just jump on and off of these material hoists over there.\n\nThat's so irresponsible.\n\nThere's fire.\n\nThere are jacks that get thrown across the stage.\n\nThere is a large ape.\n\nAgain, I could not categorize that, but I know he shouldn't of been there! 75m is the\n\nmost OSHA violating stage in Smash Bros.\n\nAnd if you have to get rid of one of them, that's the one you should get rid of first,\n\nand then you should get rid of the rest of them, too.\n\nBecause, again, OSHA does not stop after one stage.\n\nLet's remember back to the beginning of this video when I talked about violation penalties.\n\nI mentioned that every serious violation of OSHA is $12,934 in fines.\n\nI forgot to mention that every repeated or willful violation is $129,336 per violation.\n\nI am going to pretend that I found all of these violations on the same day, and that\n\nthey didn't have a chance to fix them all, so therefore they are not repeated.\n\nBut that's still 1,317 violations.\n\nOr $17,034,078 in fines.\n\nWhich is why I am sending you this video, Masahiro Sakurai.\n\nSurely you can't afford 17 million dollars in fines.\n\nI'm willing to let bygones be bygones.\n\nOSHA doesn't need to hear about all of this evidence I've compiled.\n\nAll you must do is send me 50 US dollars.\n\nI'm in a real tough situation right now and I just need to get through the month.\n\nPlease.\n\nAlso you could send me Kirby's phone number.\n\nI know he is real.\n\nWhere are you hiding him?\n\nAnd I have yet to see a Super Smash Bros. stage that includes a toilet.\n\nAnd I need to see where Donkey Kong pees.\n\n*Pat & Brian laughing* And I need to know where Donkey Kong Pees.\n\nOh god I was so close!\n\nAnd I need to know where Donkey Kong peeHHSHSS.\n\n*through laughter* sorry this is... *breathe in* AHHHH ", " *cheerful music, slowly diminishing*\n\nIs life quantifiable?\n\nEvery breath, every beat of a heart...\n\nDo they count as tallies etched tirelessly into the stone of our existence,\n\nuntil one day, that stone is returned to dust?\n\nIs there a number, an algorithm, underlying the spark of life?\n\nAnd if given the chance to know the arcane secrets of that algorithm,\n\nwould you use that power for good?\n\nOr would you use it to calculate your pet’s HP?\n\nBecause that’s what I would do!\n\n*energetic music*\n\nHIT POINTS!\n\nWhat are they and how did they become the standard unit of life in nearly every game?\n\nIt all started with war games, tabletop games that involve a lot of little miniature military\n\nforces fighting on a battlefield.\n\nBack in the 1920s, the Naval War College created an early form of this in order to help evaluate\n\nbattles before actually fighting them.\n\nThey had a stat called “Life” which was determined by how many\n\n14-inch shell hits a vessel could take.\n\nSo that’s what a hit point is, how many 14-inch shells it would take to kill you.\n\nEvery living creature is one hit point.\n\nThe end.\n\nBut that isn’t our current understanding of HP.\n\nThat came when war games shrank in scope and started to become more fantasy oriented.\n\nIn older games, you would roll dice, and then your troops would either survive or they would die.\n\nYou had large swaths of nameless troops so you could do this without feeling any remorse\n\nover their deaths.\n\nHaha.\n\nWar.\n\nBut when these games stopped playing with hundreds of troops and instead focused on\n\na few main characters, players realized they didn’t want their characters to die!\n\nSo the hit point was born.\n\nYour character could survive X number of bad rolls before throwing them in the garbage.\n\nSo really, the hit point wasn’t made to quantify how easy something is to kill,\n\nit was born from compassion and wanting to see your characters grow and thrive.\n\nAnd then also to figure out how easy they were to kill.\n\nWe’ve had some semblance of HP for nearly a century, but we haven’t updated our real-world\n\nunderstanding of what one hit point looks like.\n\nSo I’ll be doing that, specifically so you can quantify your pet’s HP.\n\nA little disclaimer up front:\n\nI am not giving you this algorithm so you can battle your pets.\n\nAnimal abuse is wrong.\n\nAnd if you needed me to tell you that...\n\nI’m glad I told you that.\n\nI'm also not teaching you how to calculate human HP, because that power is too great to wield,\n\nand it could easily be used for evil by some of the most wicked forces on Earth...\n\nlike health insurance companies.\n\nNo, I am teaching you how to calculate your pet’s HP as a fun bonding exercise between\n\nyou and your animal, or in case you happen to be at a house party where you don’t know\n\nanyone but the hosts have a dog and so instead of just sitting in the corner pretending to\n\ntext people, you can spend your time calculating that dog's HP, which is a way more normal\n\nthing to do in a social situation.\n\nNow it is time for the research.\n\nHow are we going to effectively calculate ANY pet’s HP?\n\nLuckily, there are plenty of games that cover pretty much every type of pet that you could\n\npossibly have, but I’ll be using Pokemon as the main pet HP analog because it is literally\n\nabout having lots and lots of pets that you can love and cherish\n\nand I’m ignoring all the other stuff.\n\nAnd that brings us to our first criteria: Type.\n\nAccording to the National Pet Owners Survey, here are the most common types of pets found\n\nin U.S. Households.\n\nI appreciate that they have included a category called “Small Animals,”\n\nas if that means fucking anything.\n\nSo we're changing some things.\n\nThe standards are still there: Dog, Cat, Fish (and all aquatic creatures), Reptile, Bird,\n\nEquine, Small animal is becoming small mammal for things like ferrets and rabbits.\n\nWe're also including bug, because I love bugs!\n\nAnd if you have bugs in your house and you make the conscious decision to WANT those bugs in your house,\n\nthey aren't pests,\n\nthey're pets...s.\n\nAmphibian for the frog people.\n\nFarm animals covers any livestock that don’t immediately fit into the other categories.\n\nOriginally, I thought about classifying these quadrupedal animals as different sorts of dog.\n\nChunky dog, milky dog, horny dog.\n\nBut farm animal encompasses them a little bit better.\n\nI am still keeping those names, though.\n\nWe also have a category I call “exotic,” which encompasses all of the animals you see\n\nin instagram influencer pics that make you say,\n\nThis can go from monkeys to bats to hyenas, which, according to this incredibly reliable\n\nwebsite, I could technically own in New York due to a loophole?\n\n*about to make a terrible decision*\n\nAlso, Millennials and Gen Z often live in tiny, “no pet” apartments and\n\ndon’t get paid enough to support a decent standard of living for themselves, let alone\n\na pet, so they’ll often turn to plants in order to feel the joy that comes from nurturing\n\na living thing in our rapidly decaying ecosystem.\n\n*sigh*\n\nSo I’m extending pet status to plants so that way you too can do this HP calculation,\n\nbecause, god, we all need a distraction sometimes.\n\nBy building a set of pet types, we are able to assign HP RANGES to each of them by finding\n\nthe lowest base HP and highest max HP of each type.\n\nThe absolute extremes of this scale are Shedinja, with a base HP of 1, and Wailord, with a max HP of 544.\n\nNow, both of these would be pretty wild to have as pets,\n\nconsidering one is the shell left behind after a cicada molts,\n\nand the other is a fucking whale.\n\nBut that’s why they’re the extremes, and that’s why we are not done with our equation yet.\n\nWe might know the full HP range of a dog, but what is the HP range of YOUR dog.\n\nI thought for a moment about having size be the next criteria, because you might think\n\nthat the larger the animal, the more HP it would have.\n\nBut that’s actually not true!\n\nIn fact, the Pokemon with the highest base HP is Blissey, this strange little egg woman.\n\nAnd Onix, an enormous rock snake, has one of the lowest base HPs of all Pokemon.\n\nThis confused me, so I had to go back to the original popularizer of HP: Dungeons & Dragons.\n\nAnd it was there that I realized what truly affects your HP value:\n\nYour value is not defined by the size or shape of your body,\n\nit’s about what you do with the body you’re given.\n\n*cheesy motivational music*\n\nIt’s all about class!\n\nAs in, what standard gaming class does your pet fall into?\n\nEvery class has different HP ranges based on what they are expected to do.\n\nBarbarians are out in the front lines, so they tend to have a lot more HP than a rogue,\n\nwho is slinking around in the back.\n\nI’ve decided that the classes that make the most sense for pets are: Barbarian, Ranger,\n\nPaladin, Cleric, and Rogue.\n\nI haven’t included any classes like sorcerer, because if you have a magical pet,\n\nwhat are you doing here?\n\nGo cast spells with your turtle.\n\nThese class distinctions separate your pet’s HP range into 10 equal portions.\n\nIf your pet is a rogue, you get the first six.\n\nIf your pet is a barbarian, you're anywhere from five to 10.\n\nYour pet’s personality will determine what class they fall into.\n\nYour pet is a rogue if they are rakish, mischievous, and spry.\n\nCats tend to come to mind for the rogue category, simply because they’re always up in shit\n\nthey should not be up in.\n\nYour pet is a cleric if they are kind, reserved, and healing.\n\nA rabbit that hops onto your lap after a rough day of work and makes you forget all your\n\nworries is 100% cleric.\n\nYour pet is a paladin if it is loyal, resourceful, and, honestly, tries a little bit too hard.\n\nDoes your zucchini plant produce too many zucchinis?\n\nA.K.A.\n\nAny amount of zucchinis?\n\nIt's a paladin.\n\nYour pet is a ranger if they are self-sufficient, aloof, and kind of do their own thing.\n\nAsk yourself, am I holding my pet rat back from their true ambitions?\n\nThe answer is always yes, and your rat is a ranger.\n\nAnd finally your pet is a barbarian if they are boorish, brazen, and courageous to a fault.\n\nDoes your dog dig under the fence so it can jump into your neighbor’s pool?\n\nYour dog is Marmaduke.\n\nIt is also a Barbarian.\n\nYour pet can have a combination of many of these traits, but it’s up to you to decide\n\nwhich traits are most dominant.\n\nNow that we have your pet’s type and class designated, we need to get into the nitty\n\ngritty of their exact HP, which means finding your pet's level.\n\nIn order to do this, you must observe your pet in a scientific manner.\n\nSo I reached out to field biologist.\n\nHi, I’m Olivia.\n\nI'm a wildlife biologist.\n\nI contacted Olivia after she responded to my totally normal twitter request with this\n\ndope-ass picture.\n\nI figured that if anyone knew how to calculate the hit points of an animal, it would be someone\n\nholding a huge bird like it was a torch.\n\nHave you ever found the hit points of any of the animals you've been researching?\n\nI've never been involved in any sort of study where that was something that we looked at.\n\nSo no.\n\nOkay.\n\nBut there are probably plenty of studies about hit points with animals.\n\nProbably.\n\nThough she didn’t have experience with my specific question, I knew she would have some\n\nuseful advice for observing animals in their natural habitat.\n\nWhen you're observing an animal, how much interaction should you have with it?\n\nNone.\n\nNone.\n\nAt all.\n\nNone.\n\nYou have to sit in like a blind or a tent of some sort where you're hidden or you look\n\nlike part of the environment.\n\nYou could wear a ghillie suit.\n\nBrian - Oh!\n\nOlivia - People have also done that.\n\nHow long of a period are you observing that animal for?\n\nIt depends on how much time and resources you have, obviously.\n\nThere have been scientists that have been observing the same hawk for, like, 20 years in a row.\n\nSo if I'm trying to... perfectly know my pet's HP, I should be observing it for\n\nmultiple years.\n\nYes.\n\nCool.\n\nHow do you take notes when you're observing an animal.\n\nRight, so, I actually—can I send you something?\n\nYes, please.\n\nThis is exactly what I was looking for.\n\nOlivia had sent me an animal behavior data sheet, which I could use as a template for\n\nobserving and recording a pet’s behavior.\n\nBut some of these behaviors wouldn’t make sense when observing your pet on a random day.\n\nWe ended up developing a new sheet that had standard behaviors and class specific behaviors\n\nthat had different weights associated with them.\n\nYou observe your pet for X number of hours, tally up all the behaviors they did over the\n\ncourse of those hours, and then divide the weighted total by X to give you your pet’s level.\n\nThe logic behind this is that a higher level pet is more likely to do more intense and\n\nclass specific behaviors.\n\nThen you plug that level into this algorithm, and you get your pet’s HP.\n\nIt may seem challenging, but science shouldn’t be easy, it should be correct.\n\nThis is probably the hardest scientific work you've ever had to do.\n\nIt really is.\n\nYeah.\n\nWith these tips in mind, I welcome you into my home.\n\nIn order to test these calculations, I need a test subject.\n\nSo I’m using my roommate’s cat, Zuko!\n\nHe lives in my apartment but he doesn’t pay rent and he eats my bagels if I leave\n\nthem unattended.\n\nAs I mentioned previously, finding your pet's HP can be a fun bonding exercise, and in this\n\ncase, I’ve been dealing with this small bastard’s antics for so long, I need to\n\nremind myself why he’s here by quantifying his value.\n\nThe first step is easy!\n\nHe is a cat.\n\nThat puts him in the cat category.\n\nOkay.\n\nStep two, we gotta give Zuko a class.\n\nAs I mentioned previously, cats are often rogues, but I don't think that fits Zuko considering\n\nhe’s the least stealthy creature I know.\n\nHis meow sounds like he’s been smoking two packs a day for the past forty years.\n\n*incredibly raspy meow*\n\nAnd every time he does manage to sneak into his food cabinet,\n\nhe lets me know immediately.\n\nJust wanted to check in on what's going on up here in the cat cabinet where we keep all\n\nof the food for the cat.\n\n*loud crash*\n\nHe is loud, stubborn, and not afraid to make terrible decisions in plain\n\nview of me.\n\nAnd that makes this guy a Barbarian.\n\nOkay!\n\nBut now it is time to observe Zuko to find his level.\n\nAs per Olivia’s instructions, I must observe him for several years without any interaction.\n\nAfter explaining why I needed it, my time off request was denied.\n\nSo instead, I ate some bodega sushi in order to induce illness, and I took a sick day.\n\nMmmm.\n\nThis is the hard part, because it's going to require me to observe Zuko as he goes about\n\nhis daily business without him noticing that I am here at all.\n\nI assumed my position, and I waited for the interesting behaviors to start.\n\n*cheeky music plays*\n\nNot only was this terribly boring, but I was beginning to fear that Zuko\n\nwas not as strong as I had hoped.\n\nDO SOMETHING!\n\nPLEASE!\n\nBut then I realized there was a exploit in my system.\n\nThough Olivia, a scientist, said that you should keep your interferences to a minimum...\n\nI’m not a scientist, I’m a gamer.\n\nAnd I began what is known as power leveling.\n\nI had to get Zuko as many experience points as I could before my roommate got home and\n\nasked me what I was doing.\n\nOver the course of the day, Zuko averaged 63 behavioral experience points per hour,\n\nalthough those behaviors were somewhat coerced by me.\n\nI know that I broke my system by interacting with Zuko, but if it makes my pet happier\n\nand it makes him less of a weak-ass scrub, why wouldn’t I game the system!\n\nI had also noticed that Zuko and I had grown closer, our support level had increased to\n\nat least a B. I no longer saw him as a freeloader who sometimes throws up in my bed,\n\nI saw him as a companion...\n\nwho sometimes throws up in my bed.\n\nWhen I felt lonely in my empty apartment, he was there for me.\n\nWhen my stomach ached from the bodega sushi, he purred at just the right frequency to ease my pain.\n\nWhen I was worried he was going to be under leveled, he soothed my anxieties\n\nwith his heavenly voice.\n\n*beautiful meow*\n\nAnd all this time I had spent trying to calculate his HP,\n\nI hadn't realized he was replenishing mine.\n\nSo here is Zuko, Barbarian class level 63.\n\nI love him with all my heart, and he loves me just the same.\n\nOw!\n\nOkay, okay...\n\n*lots of wonderful meows*\n\nBeautiful.\n\nPsst!\n\nRemember when I said I really wanted to play the Cyberpunk RPG?\n\nWe finally did it.\n\nCome watch me play as a totally uncool forum moderator called Vang0Bang0.\n\nGuys don't say other things, we should only have one person in the...\n\nYou're making it sound like there are more than one person in...\n\nThere's only one person in the bathroom! ", ' *drum beat*\n\nTHE SIMS! While other games push you through the meticulously crafted story\n\nof some hero, this game allows you to experience the joy that comes from crafting your friends and family\n\nand then making them pee themselves in doorless rooms.\n\nI’ve been playing The Sims since I was a kid, and it allowed me to imagine what I might become.\n\nA successful doctor, perhaps, with a mansion\n\nand a pool that doesn’t have a ladder to get out of it.\n\nAnd now that I’m a D-list internet video producer with a grungy apartment in New York City,\n\nI’ve realized that I was using The Sims as wish fulfillment.\n\nPerhaps there’s a better way.\n\nI might only have one life, but my Sim can live many, many lives.\n\nI was playing a game.\n\nI should have been doing an experiment.\n\nSo today, I’m going to use The Sims to perfect my living situation.\n\n*music stops*\n\nOh what a surprise!\n\nNow, this Unraveled will be a little bit different\n\nconsidering most of it is going to be game footage, meaning...\n\nI don’t need any paper!\n\nLet me explain my methodology. We will have two subjects:\n\nSimulated Brian, and reality Brian, which is me, I’m Reality Brian.\n\nHere’s my hypothesis: If Simulated Brian’s living situation can be perfected in the Sims,\n\nthen Reality Brian’s living situation can also be perfected by altering it the same way in real life.\n\nNow, I could try to do this in a “perfectly controlled environment,” but life is messy and sometimes\n\nscience has to be messy, too. So before I can create my Sim...\n\nI gotta measure my apartment.\n\nObviously, I have to work with what I currently have. And if I’m supposed to make an honest\n\nsimulacrum of my living situation I gotta make sure it’s to scale.\n\nI should also point out that I live in a three bedroom apartment with two roommates and a cat. And although\n\nthey have rooms of their own, I will not be modeling them in the Sims.\n\nPartially because I rarely spend any time in their rooms, but it’s more because I am a good roommate\n\nwho respects personal boundaries. I will not redecorate their personal spaces.\n\nBut I will exploit the common space for content.\n\nWhen you cut my roommates rooms, you can split my apartment into 6 different sections.\n\nI used vanilla Sims 4, because I didn’t want Simulated Brian to accidentally become a wizard, or a skeleton,\n\nor a college student.\n\nThe first step is to make an accurate depiction of myself, both in personality and in appearance.\n\nThis took a good chunk of time, but it was worth it when I crafted an exact 1 to 1 replica\n\nof myself in the Sims. Then, I built the space. I used my measurements and gave myself close\n\nto unlimited funds to create the apartment, and bought myself the cheapest appliances\n\njust like my landlord did.\n\nAt the end of this, I had a pretty exact reproduction.\n\nThen it was test time.\n\nI gave myself a career similar to my own, and then I let Simulated Brian do his thing.\n\nMy rule was that I had to have little to no interaction.\n\nBut after a few days, it became clear that there were flaws with my experiment.\n\nOne, it was too slow.\n\nIf I want a longitudinal look at Simulated Brian’s living situation, I need to see his ENTIRE life.\n\nTwo, this experiment is meant to perfect my living situation, not my job.\n\nAnd currently, Sim Brian is finding enough fulfillment in his career, which is an uncontrolled space.\n\nSim Brian needs to stay in his apartment, and that means no job.\n\nThree, Sim Brian was perfectly content reading books,\n\nand everyone knows that books are BORING!\n\nSo I obviously need to fix whatever personality flaw turned my Sim into a dweeb.\n\nI addressed the first flaw by downloading a mod that would allow me to put on Ultra Fast Speed.\n\nI also altered my sim\'s personality to reflect my own… and I accepted that Simulated Brian’s appearance\n\nwasn’t all that accurate in the first trial, so I fixed that as well.\n\nWith the new personality traits and the ultra fast speed mod, this trial was far more accurate.\n\nI spent a lot of time standing in my bathroom, staring at the wall, or sadly contemplating my reflection.\n\nAnd then Sim Brian died of starvation after 4 days.\n\nWhich is a MASSIVE SUCCESS!\n\nI got to see the entirety of my Sim\'s life!\n\nIn trial 3, I took a hands-off approach.\n\nI popped on ultra fast speed, and I let it ride.\n\nIn this trial, I die of starvation after just 2 and a half days.\n\nWhich makes me think that this mod might be so fast that Sim Brian can’t feed himself.\n\nSo in trial 4, I start on normal fast speed,\n\nand I decide I’ll only jump to lightspeed when I’m bored.\n\nAnd things start well enough!\n\nSim Brian manages to socialize and stay happy for two days.\n\nIt starts to break down on Tuesday, when I find my sim\n\nsadly eating a grilled cheese in his empty kitchen.\n\nAnd then on Wednesday, Sim Brian sadly eats cereal while staring out the kitchen window.\n\nThings get real bad at 2 am on Thursday,\n\nwhen he stares in the mirror for hours.\n\nThe ennui has set in.\n\nThat afternoon, he stands in front of some dirty dishes on the coffee table,\n\ntoo depressed to wash them in the sink, which is mere feet away.\n\nSim Brian goes through the same motions for the next week.\n\nWatching TV. Staring in the mirror. Sleeping at random intervals. He seems devastatingly unhappy.\n\nBut he manages to live a much fuller life than the past two iterations!\n\nIt takes him nearly a week longer to die of starvation!\n\nExcept, he doesn’t really die.\n\nIn an effort to expedite the death sequence, I accidentally hit ultra fast speed,\n\nand for some reason,\n\nthis killed death.\n\nI waited, hoping the reaper would respawn, but no.\n\nSo I rushed through the days.\n\nWaiting for someone to find my collapsed body in the weird corner of my creepy hallway,\n\nbut the only people who noticed my quote unquote "death"\n\nwere the utility companies.\n\nI used this moment to look around my neighborhood.\n\nMost houses were far nicer.\n\nI was alone in a little box surrounded by neighbors who had forgotten me, or perhaps never knew I existed.\n\nEven death had forgotten me.\n\nI watched my slumped body linger in limbo as nothing changed.\n\nAfter a week, I resigned myself to quitting.\n\nAnd then in trial 5 I peed myself!\n\nA LOT!\n\nBoy, trial 5 exemplifies how much my apartment needs an upgrade.\n\nAt the beginning of the trial, my sim left the house to socialize.\n\nAnd he was so happy not being in his tiny apartment that he stayed outside for 12 hours,\n\nignoring his bodily functions, and at 9pm, while speaking to a potential new friend,\n\nhe peed himself.\n\nDoes this make the embarrassed and uncomfortable Sim go inside?\n\nNO.\n\nSim Brian so loathes his living space that he decides to stand outside all night browsing the internet,\n\nuntil again, he pees himself right before having a flirty conversation with his friend Terri.\n\nDirty, dirty Terri.\n\nAfter another full day outside,\n\nhunger, exhaustion, and the need to pee FINALLY make Sim Brian go home.\n\nHe was more willing to spend two nights soaked in piss before spending a single minute inside his apartment.\n\nBig Mood.\n\nThe rest of his life was typical. Mirror. Standing. Dying of starvation.\n\nAfter 5 control trials, it was time for the results.\n\nHere’s what I learned:\n\nOne, I’d rather spend time outside my house in repulsive conditions than spend time inside my house.\n\nSomething needs to change.\n\nTwo, the only thing that ever managed to make Sim Brian happy\n\nwas “good decoration.”\n\nI need to redecorate.\n\nAnd three, Sim Brian managed his basic needs until he became desolate due to a lack of social interaction.\n\nA hole so deep he couldn’t go anywhere but down.\n\nAnd this makes me believe that the thing that killed me was not starvation,\n\nbut rather becoming so lonely that I no longer sought to fix my situation.\n\nBut that has nothing to do with my apartment,\n\nso let’s focus on the things we can change!\n\nSimulated Brian was happiest in these terrible trials when the decorations were good,\n\nand that’s something I can fix in real life.\n\nBut before I do, let’s set some ground rules:\n\nOne, I can\'t alter any of the rooms in my apartment, or I\'d lose my security deposit.\n\nTwo, I can\'t change the furniture, because my roommates bought it, and then they’d hate me.\n\nAnd three, the money. I had considered giving my sim a budget similar to my own,\n\nbut money cannot buy happiness.\n\nAnd if this is true, then money, when compared to happiness, has no correlation.\n\nTherefore, money is no object, and my sim should be allowed to purchase anything regardless of price.\n\nInfinite money.\n\nSims decorations show how many environmental points they are worth.\n\nBy this logic, it doesn’t matter how well a room is decorated…\n\nit matters how MUCH a room is decorated.\n\nSo I spent a solid hour giving my apartment the most decorations possible.\n\nAllow me to give you a first person tour.\n\nThe Living Room now has lots of beautiful paintings.\n\nThe Weird Nook now has a purpose as The JAZZ Room, because for some reason,\n\nthe Sims has SO MANY JAZZ PAINTINGS.\n\nThe TV has to stay, but now I have three maps around it to say, “I’m also smart sometimes.”\n\nThe Kitchen hasn’t changed because it’s small and there’s no space to hang anything.\n\nThe creepiness of the hallway has crystallized into Sad Clowns.\n\nNo one wanted to spend much time in this hallway before,\n\nand now they REALLY don’t want to.\n\nIn my room, a bunch of portraits, an apple wall, and a pear wall.\n\nThis should remind my sim to eat food.\n\nAnd finally, in the bathroom, I installed a second mirror so I can’t just stare at the wall.\n\nNow let’s see it in action.\n\nIn the first trial, I did another hands off approach on ultra fast speed,\n\nand my sim once again died of starvation super quickly.\n\nSo, yeah, maybe the mod is too strong.\n\nBUT! In trial 2, things go way better.\n\nFor the first time in any of the trials,\n\nmy sim manages to go from Very Sad to Happy, thanks to the tasteful decorations!\n\nThough Sim Brian has moments of ennui and loneliness, for the most part, the house is making him happier.\n\nSim Brian does so well that he survives after the utilities shut off his power and water,\n\nand he dies of starvation after more than two weeks.\n\nThat’s nearly DOUBLE the length of any of the other trials!\n\nMY DECORATIONS WORKED!\n\nYeah, I still die of starvation, but I’m living TWICE AS LONG!\n\nAnd that’s all the proof I need that this is the perfect form of my apartment.\n\nAll I gotta do now is make it in real life.\n\nPolygon said that they wouldn’t reimburse me for purchasing thousands of dollars worth of paintings,\n\neven though I TOLD them it would make me more productive,\n\nso I gave myself a budget.\n\nThen I went to a lot of thrift stores to purchase\n\nas many paintings as I could find.\n\nSome fit the aesthetic. Others would need alterations.\n\nBut I got a lot of things! Or, I thought I had, until I got home and realized\n\nit wasn’t even going to cover one of my walls, let alone all six rooms.\n\nSo I dug around my apartment to find anything that could be stuck on the walls.\n\nIn the end, I was able to fill the entrance, but the rest of the living room was pretty sparse.\n\nIn the Jazz room I put up a papier mache man playing the piano, a dart board that felt pretty jazz to me,\n\nand a skeleton wearing a tank top that says "I heart my Daddy,"\n\nbecause...\n\nI honestly didn’t know where else I could put that.\n\nIn my own room, I put up the appletini painting and\n\nhung a huge self portrait from my senior year of high school.\n\nAnd that was it.\n\nThat’s all I had in terms of decorations.\n\nI took the day off to do this, but I was done in an hour.\n\nI even put on my suit in order to film the results of the trial,\n\nbut my house felt as empty as it had when I began.\n\nI couldn’t start the live experiment because I couldn’t recreate my sim’s house.\n\nBut I wasn’t giving up.\n\nIf I couldn’t purchase the decorations I needed, I figured I could make them myself.\n\nSo I bought a bunch of washable paint and 1000 feet of butcher paper.\n\n“I don\'t need any paper!”\n\nI lied.\n\nIt was a week before Thanksgiving. I was going to be out of town\n\nand I needed to finish this part of the video before I left.\n\nThat meant I had to create about 70 large paintings in less than three days.\n\nI got a solid start, painting all of the apples and pears.\n\nI even managed to edit the two paintings I got from the thrift store into Sad Clowns.\n\nBut I was halfway through the second Sad Clown when this process started weighing on me.\n\nIf I had to spend a few hours on 10 of the simplest paintings,\n\nthere was no way I was gonna get this finished before deadline.\n\nI was alone in an apartment making shitty paintings for a video that wasn’t gonna get made in time.\n\nI got a stress migraine, so I turned off the camera, and I went to lie down.\n\nWhen I woke up from that heinous nap,\n\nI decided to do one of the most difficult things I’ve had to do for an Unraveled:\n\nI asked for help.\n\nAnd if you’ve never had to ask your friends and coworkers\n\nto help you paint terrible paintings for a stupid video,\n\nlet me say you’re not missing out on much.\n\nIt’s an uncomfortable thing to ask people to do.\n\nAnd honestly, the weirdest part of this whole process is that...\n\npeople said yes.\n\nPeople said they\'d come help me paint.\n\nAnd, and they said yes just because they wanted to,\n\nand also \'cause I said I’d buy pizza,\n\nbut you gotta grease the wheels somehow.\n\nSo I turned my house into a painting factory. I cut the paper. I moved the furniture.\n\nAnd that night, people came over. Not just my roommate and my coworkers but my friends,\n\nand friends of those friends.\n\nI was expecting one or two people to help me, but I ended up with 10 people in my house,\n\nall painting large scale portraits\n\nand REALLY GOOD SAD CLOWNS.\n\nSeriously, who knew that my friends were SO GOOD at painting sad clowns?\n\nI don’t 100% know how to feel about how good my friends are at painting sad clowns,\n\nbut I\'m glad I gave \'em an outlet.\n\nAll of these people came over just to make my apartment happier.\n\nTo lend a hand when I was overwhelmed.\n\nAnd not only were they helping me make my apartment happier by decorating it,\n\nthey made it happier just by being there.\n\nThis task that had given me a stress migraine became a really fun time.\n\nAnd it reminded me that, although it can sometimes feel uncomfortable or embarrassing,\n\nif you ask for help, more often than not,\n\npeople are willing to help\n\nyou paint large pictures of jazz men.\n\nIn three hours, a task that seemed insurmountable by myself was complete.\n\nAnd I was so excited that I did the walkthrough while they were all still there.\n\nThe Living room with fabulous landscapes,\n\nThe Jazz room’s huge murals.\n\nThe Creepy clown hallway that was way too good.\n\nMy room with its amazing portraits and fruit walls.\n\nAnd the bathroom, where I stared at myself,\n\nnot considering my flaws or my apartment, but just smiling.\n\nThat’s it.\n\nJust smiling.\n\nIt’s been well over two weeks since my apartment was redecorated,\n\nwhich is longer than I survived in the Sims trials,\n\nso it’s been an incredible success.\n\nMy apartment is perfected, I’m happier with it, and it’s all thanks to the redecoration.\n\nOr at least, that’s part of it.\n\nI think that part of the reason I find so much joy in my apartment is knowing\n\nthat the decorations were made by people I care about.\n\nThere’s a story behind it.\n\nSimulated Brian fell further into sadness due to his isolation,\n\nbut the paint night turned Reality Brian’s terrible situation into something joyous.\n\nSo I have to wonder:\n\nDoes my newly perfected apartment make me happier because of the decorations,\n\nor because of the people who helped me decorate it?\n\nTrick question, it’s obviously the decorations.\n\n*club beat*\n\n*saxophone solo*\n\n*mouth trumpet noises*\n\n*dart rebounds off the board*\n\nJESUS! ', ' Ah, the Elder Scrolls, games chock-full of lore.\n\nAnd Skyrim is no different.\n\nHidden amongst the draugr and dragons is a plethora of books full of very important\n\nand incredibly niche details.\n\nBut with all the spellcasting and shouting you must do as dragonborn, who really has\n\nthe time to read all those books.\n\nI DO.\n\nAPPARENTLY.\n\nI read every book in Skyrim in order to answer the eternal question, “Should you read every\n\nbook in Skyrim?”\n\nAnd I’m here to give you my top five recommendations of books, here in my SKYRIM BOOK REPORT.\n\nSkyrim book report!\n\nHow many books are there, really, in Skyrim?\n\nAfter all, there are only eight people credited as writers on Skyrim.\n\nThose eight people are responsible for every quest, every voice acting line, every response\n\nyou can give to an NPC.\n\nHow much time do they have to write all those other books?\n\nA lot!\n\nBecause they wrote this many books.\n\nThis many books.\n\n*pained grin*\n\nOr at least they wrote most of them because a few of them have been grandfathered in from\n\nother Elder Scrolls games.\n\nBefore I get into the nitty gritty, let me explain my process on how I did this Skyrim\n\nBook Report.\n\nI printed out every book in Skryim, and then I spent multiple eight-hour days reading EVERY.\n\nSINGLE.\n\nBOOK.\n\nI whittled it down to 338 books because I didn’t include journals or diaries.\n\nEveryone knows that self-published doesn’t count.\n\nIn total, that’s 571 pages, five and a half point font, over three hundred and sixteen\n\nTHOUSAND words.\n\nI had two reactions to this.\n\nMy first reaction was, “Wow.”\n\nThis is an incredible amount of world building.\n\nTo write 300,000 words that could essentially be skipped over while still having the full\n\nSkyrim experience, it’s amazing, and it’s a level of world building that could only\n\nexist in an interactive medium.\n\nAnd for that, I commend you, Bethesda.\n\nMy second reaction to this,\n\nwas WHAT THE FUCK.\n\nHEY TODD?\n\nWHAT THE FU-\n\nIn my Skyrim Book Report, I will be discussing:\n\n*smack*\n\nThat’s a smash cut.\n\nHopefully.\n\nIf I do my editing correctly.\n\n338 books.\n\nUh, actually, 337, I just realized, um, over here, Songs of Skyrim, I put both of them\n\nin there, but there’s a revised edition.\n\nI lied.\n\nIt’s just 337 books now.\n\nObviously, I don’t have time to synopsize all of these, and believe me, you wouldn’t\n\nwant to watch that even if I could.\n\nI’ve split them into categories to make this a little bit easier.\n\nFirst up, historical books!\n\nThese book titles you see rolling up the screen are all biographies or histories.\n\nWhat I categorized as histories was anything that had big historical dates in them, explanatory\n\nhistories, or pretty much anything that was boring.\n\nHistory’s so BORING.\n\nUGHHHH.\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien\n\n*kiss*\n\ndid the world a disservice by making every single fantasy writer think\n\nthat they need to chronicle every goddamn minute of their world in order for it to be\n\nlegitimate.\n\nI don’t give two shits about a king who lost a war 700 years ago.\n\n*snoring noises* Get OUTTA here!\n\nSome of these biographies are actually pretty interesting.\n\nBut a lot of them are written like The Chronicles of Nchuleft.\n\nI didn’t tab it out ‘cause it’s a shitty story.\n\n“It happened in Second Planting (P.D. 1220) that Lord Ihlendam, on a journey in the Western\n\nUplands, came to Nchuleft; and Protector Anchard and General Rkungthunch met him there, and\n\nDalen-Zanchu also came to the meeting.\n\nThey talked together long by themselves; but this only was known of their business, that\n\nthey were to be friends of each other.\n\nThey parted, and each went home to his own colony.”\n\nRIVETING.\n\nUgh.\n\nHistory’s so boring.\n\nI’m done with this.\n\nNext category: Instructional books!\n\nThese are all field guides or basic recipes about how to make good armor or what flowers\n\ngo in which potions.\n\nAt best, they are in-fiction instructional books.\n\nAt worst, they are so obviously trying to get you to go do specific things.\n\nPulls you right out of the fiction!\n\nC’mon man.\n\nThat’s all I’m gonna say about that.\n\nEveryone’s favorite: the academic books.\n\nFun fact about academic books that I learned in college\n\nis that no one has ever enjoyed writing or reading an academic paper.\n\nWHY’D YOU PUT IT IN A VIDEO GAME.\n\nMythicaaaaal stories.\n\nIt’s kind of weird to differentiate things between myth and history, especially in this\n\nworld where you can talk to demon princes.\n\nI split these two up because these are very boring and these are slightly more palatable.\n\nThey’re more like creation myths, or they’re just like random stories that are fun to read,\n\nso they’re getting closer to good fiction.\n\nThe poetic and dramatic.\n\nEveryone knows that poetry and theatre are meant to be seen and not read.\n\nAnd you have NO IDEA how much it pains me that I do not have time to do staged readings\n\nof all these.\n\nOh my GOD I would have loved that.\n\nWe have “eh.”\n\nWhat genre is “eh?”\n\nIt’s the catchall.\n\nUm, these tend to be accounts, kind of like medieval fantasy op-eds.\n\nSo I…\n\nI just put ‘em here.\n\nEH!\n\nWe’re done with these now, so…\n\nGet outta here!\n\nFinally, we have 59 books that I would consider good fiction.\n\nGooooOOOD fiction.\n\nWhat I did here is I gave myself three criteria about what would make good fiction in the\n\nrealm of Skyrim.\n\nNumber one, does it help build the world around us?\n\nNumber two, does it give us an interesting or different perspective on that world?\n\nAnd number three, is it good?\n\nNow you might say, “Brian, what gives you the right to say what is good fiction?”\n\nI READ ALL 338 YA DINGUS.\n\nBELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY THAT THESE WERE THE ONLY GOOD ONES.\n\nTHIS IS ALL I’M QUALIFIED TO DO NOW.\n\nI need a drink.\n\n*deep breath*\n\nOkay!\n\nThere’s still 59 of these, so I obviously can’t summarize all of them, but I have\n\nleft five off, and they are my top five books of Skyrim.\n\nSo we’re gonna talk about those.\n\nNumber five, Advances in Lockpicking.\n\nNow Advances in Lockpicking is actually an instructional book.\n\nBut I think it does more than just the other instructional books, where you open them up\n\nand suddenly you’re better at lockpicking, because it’s written by a thief in a very\n\ninteresting voice.\n\nThere’s a great ending line for this book: “Some thieves can’t read.\n\nIf you can’t read, get someone to read this book to you.\n\nIt will make more sense then.”\n\nThat’s great.\n\nI think that’s a much more fun way than saying, “Here is how you pick a lock.\n\nThis is what this set of armor is.”\n\nBetter than instructional.\n\nJust good fiction.\n\nNumber four, Palla.\n\nIn a world where crazy creatures exist, how do you make fiction that is compelling that\n\npeople can just kind of experience in their own life.\n\nPalla is a necromantic romantic book.\n\nIt’s a story about a man who sees this beautiful statue of a woman fighting a beast and falls\n\ninstantly in love with this woman.\n\nTurns out, she’s dead!\n\nFrom fighting that beast.\n\nHe decides to get into necromancy to bring her back from the dead.\n\nI kind of don’t want to ruin the surprise for you.\n\nIt manages to tell an interesting story while also introducing these ideas of monsters and\n\nnecromancy.\n\nIt’s kind of weird, but it’s very well written.\n\nI’m gonna go ahead and put up three and two.\n\nWhy do I put up the Argonian Account and Feyfolken at the same time?\n\nTurns out, it’s written by the same fictional author: WAUGHIN JARTH.\n\nThis one’s for you, Waughin!\n\nI’m a big Jarth head!\n\nHe’s not actually in the story at all, I couldn’t find any instance of, like, him\n\nas an NPC.\n\nSo I really hope he’s in the next one.\n\nBecause I want to meet Waughin.\n\nI just want to meet Waughin Jarth.\n\nThese ones were not actually written specifically for Skyrim.\n\nThey were grandfathered in.\n\nBut they do an incredible job of building the world around you.\n\nThe Argonian Account is actually the second story in a series all about Decumus Scotti.\n\nThis is kind of like the Hobbit of Tamriel, where we’re taking this unassuming character\n\nand thrusting them into this completely foreign, amazing landscape, except instead of a hobbit,\n\nit is a midlevel bureaucrat.\n\nIt’s full of screwball comedy and wonderful worldbuilding about the Black Marsh which\n\nis where all the Argonians live.\n\nYou have to fast travel by being eaten alive by a worm.\n\nThat’s great.\n\nI want to see that whenever we go to the Black Marsh.\n\nIt’s so flavorful, and that’s why I’m a Jarth head.\n\nFeyfolken.\n\nIt’s a story about a scribe who’s terrible at his job but gets this enchanted quill that\n\nforces him to be amazing.\n\nSends himself into this madness, and he kills himself at the end of the book, spoiler alert.\n\nBut that’s not what this story is really about.\n\nIt’s an interesting fiction that teaches you about different Daedric princes, and which\n\nones could have caused this specific enchantment on the quill.\n\nThat’s good worldbuilding!\n\nI am interested in the story!\n\nYou told me something that I can learn about the world.\n\nI had a good time reading Feyfolken!\n\nJarth, ya did it again!\n\nAnd that leaves us with the number one book.\n\nIt’s not The Lusty Argonian Maid.\n\nI feel like I should broach this subject.\n\nI’ll tell you why I didn’t include it in my good fiction list,\n\nand it’s not because I’m a prude, who doesn’t love a little erotic lizard fiction?\n\n*OOH COME ON BABY*\n\nThe reason I didn’t include The Lusty Argonian Maid as one of the best\n\npieces of fiction is because it’s SEVEN ACTS LONG.\n\nSeven acts?\n\nThere is no way you can manage to maintain that level of erotic tension for seven acts.\n\nThat’s like five and a half hours!\n\nAs a person who has done one or two plays in my life, that’s just unfeasible.\n\nOkay?\n\nI’d like to see them try.\n\n~I would like to see them try~\n\n*OOH COME ON BABY*\n\nBefore I go to number one, I gotta go\n\nget a flu shot.\n\nThis is not a joke.\n\nIt’s important to get your flu shot.\n\nAlright, I’m back.\n\nThe number one piece of fiction in Skyrim, not Waughin Jarth, I’m sorry.\n\nIt’s Beggar, Thief, Warrior, King.\n\nIt’s four books, actually.\n\nBut it’s all part of Eslaf Erol’s story.\n\nIt is completely fiction even within the fiction of Skyrim.\n\nThe reason I put it first is because it’s the only book that was legitimately hilarious.\n\nI straight up chortled.\n\n*chortle*\n\nThat’s what I did.\n\nIn real life.\n\nThat’s amazing.\n\nThe writing style of these four books is just naturally hilarious.\n\nThere are so many bland, cookie-cutter stories in Skyrim that follow the same set up, twist, punchline.\n\nThis doesn’t have that.\n\nIt’s just a good story.\n\nOne of these writers was just flexing, and I think that’s wonderful that a writer had\n\na chance to—within the fiction of Skyrim—write something that’s just naturally funny.\n\nYou should all go home, onto your computers, boot up Skyrim, find these four books, and\n\nthen read them, in order.\n\nIt’s worth it!\n\nThat’s my quest, for you in Skyrim.\n\n300 gold points.\n\nThat’s it!\n\nThat’s it, that’s all of the books.\n\nSo like, what did I learn from reading all 338 books of Skyrim?\n\nSurprisingly, a whole lot.\n\nLike, there are two main takeaways that I pulled from this.\n\nNumber one, this is a masterclass on how to write effective flavor text.\n\nBetween all of these, historical, instructional, the good fiction, and, you know, the iffy fiction.\n\nThis is a way to learn what to do and what not to do.\n\nObviously, not everyone is going to connect with certain types of flavor text.\n\nI’m sure there’s a lot of people that disagree with me and think that the historical\n\nis the most important flavor text.\n\nAnd you know what?\n\nThey are valid.\n\nAnd they’re wrong.\n\nAnd they always seem to find my comment sections.\n\nWhen you take something good like Feyfolken which teaches you about the Daedric princes,\n\nbut in an interesting way, it really shines in comparison to the three and a half million\n\nbiographies of Barenziah.\n\nYou don’t even see them in Skyrim.\n\nI don’t care about Barenziah.\n\nIT’S BORIIIIIII-\n\nBut not like Feyfolken!\n\nThat’s really interesting and effective.\n\nAlso it just teaches you about all these wonderful forms of fiction.\n\nIf you’re a fiction teacher, like, teach your kids with Skyrim!\n\nTEACH THE KIDS.\n\nWITH SKYRIM.\n\nI got a creative writing degree.\n\nThat’s all I have to say about that.\n\nSecond takeaway, this is a wonderful teaching device about unreliable narrators.\n\nSo many of these histories are negating other ones.\n\nThis is a wonderful way of showing people you need to read everything if you’re going\n\nto get the whole picture.\n\nI read everything.\n\nI am the keeper of the picture.\n\nThat’s every book in Skyrim.\n\nSo it’s time for us to revisit that ever present question, “Should you read every\n\nbook in Skyrim?”\n\nNO!\n\nWHAT?\n\nHOW COULD YOU WATCH THIS WHOLE 10+ MINUTE VIDEO AND THINK THAT I WOULD SAY ANYTH- WHAT?\n\nNO!\n\nI BORE THIS BURDEN!\n\nFOR YOU!\n\nDON’T READ THEM!\n\nNO!\n\nPlease don’t read them all.\n\nDON’T READ THEM!\n\nYou can read the top five, that’s fine.\n\nGRRRRR.\n\nHOW DARE YOU JETTISON MY GIFT!\n\nDON’T READ THEM!\n\nNOOOOOOOOOOO\n\nIf you want to see me keep doing things like this, make sure to hit that subscribe button.\n\nAnd now for a staged reading of The Sultry Argonian Bard.\n\nPat: I could never perform your request.\n\nBDG: Oh!\n\nIs it too fast for you.\n\nPat: I fear I may damage my… instrument.\n\nBDG: Ah, but you seem to handle it so well my darling.\n\nPat: My lady you flatter me.\n\nBDG: Well it is such a LARGE and MAGNIFICENT piece. ', " Sonic the Hedgehog has been enjoying a bit of resurgence as of late\n\nbecause of his upcoming feature film.\n\nWhich is great because\n\nOH! OH THOSE LEGS ARE WAY TOO HUMAN.\n\nTHOSE LEGS ARE...\n\nOH MY GOD.\n\nTHOSE LEGS LOOK LIKE I COULD HAVE THOSE LEGS.\n\nPLEASE DON'T SHOW THAT TO ME ANYMORE.\n\nPLEASE GET.\n\nGET IT OUT OF HERE.\n\nscreaming\n\nThis new Sonic has a lot of fans crying heresy.\n\nSonic should be that cute, blue, cartoon hedgehog that’s gotta go fast,\n\nand that’s all he’s gotta do.\n\nBut what if I told you that this was not the only blasphemous version of Sonic\n\nWhat if I told you that nearly every single piece of Sonic media was heretical\n\nI hold in my hand 13 pages that prove just that.\n\nBefore I hop into the deep end, I need to explain a little about Sega, these 13 pages,\n\nand how Sonic was made.\n\nYou see, Sega was in a real tough spot in the early ‘90s as it tried to compete with\n\nNintendo and the overwhelmingly successful Mario.\n\nSo they worked internally to create a new mascot.\n\nNot just for a game, but for the company as a whole.\n\nNaoto Ohshima created Mr. Needlemouse, a teal hedgehog with red sneakers.\n\nAnd then he worked with Yuji Naka to create a game around this wonderful creature.\n\nA few tweaks and Sonic the Hedgehog was born.\n\nOr at least one version of Sonic was born.\n\nYou see, Sega wasn’t just fighting with Nintendo, it was also fighting with itself.\n\nSega of America and Sega of Japan had a lot of tension between them, and they didn’t\n\nsee eye to eye on a lot of things, especially when it came to Sonic.\n\nThe original version of Sonic was a bit more punk rock and had a girlfriend.\n\nA real life human girlfriend named Madonna.\n\nAnd we all know that Sega would never make Sonic kiss a real human woman.\n\ndiscomfort\n\nSo Sega of America started to iron things out a little bit.\n\nMake Sonic a bit more family friendly.\n\nMore marketable.\n\nMadeline Schroeder, the self-described mother of Sonic, wrote out this 13-page bible that\n\nset out Sonic's true origins.\n\nThese 13 pages went on to become the true Sonic.\n\nThe Sonic we all know and love.\n\nRight\n\nNOPE.\n\nTHIS BIBLE HAS HAD VERY LITTLE BEARING ON THE SERIES AS A WHOLE.\n\nBut here’s the thing, friends.\n\nIt should have a lot of bearing on the series as a whole.\n\nAnd I am willing to wield this bible as a paladin wields a holy sword so that I might\n\nEXCISE SIN OUT FROM THE SONIC CANON.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nThat was a lot.\n\nI was a bit too intense for...\n\nI'm gonna tone it down a little bit.\n\nFolks, we’re about to engage in a friendly session of biblical literalism.\n\nNow, I’m not one to advocate taking a written account as the pure truth and nothing but...\n\nbut for Sonic I’m willing to bend my values a little bit.\n\nWe're about to take everything written in these 13 pages as gospel, and anything that deviates\n\nfrom the facts therein as sacrilege.\n\nLet’s get Sonically Fundamental.\n\nI’m not gonna read this bible in its entirety.\n\nYou can read it online if you'd like.\n\nBut I am going to read the first paragraph in full, because I think it's important for\n\nyou to understand what we’re dealing with.\n\n“Sonny Hedgehog was born on Earth in the early 21st century, in the town of Hardly,\n\nNebraska, population 1,226.”\n\nFrom the first line alone, we already know that\n\n1. Sonic’s birth name is actually Sonny.\n\n2. He is a real hedgehog that was born circa 2000.\n\nAnd 3. He’s a midwestern boy.\n\n“He and his mother and five sisters live underneath a scraggly hedge beside the local\n\nburger joint, and subsist on burger scraps, milkshakes, and the occasional slug or bug\n\nthat crawls their way.\n\nThey are a poor but happy family.”\n\nFrom these lines we know that\n\n4. Sonic's family lives in an actual hedge, which is I guess why they're called hedgehogs.\n\nAnd 5. They have a very similar diet to me.\n\n“Unfortunately, Sonny’s dad died when Sonny was just a few days old, after falling\n\ninto a gurgling, festering vat of toxic waste dumped in a nearby pond.”\n\n…\n\nWhat\n\nSonic, the lighthearted hedgehog we all know and love.\n\nNever knew his father because he was reduced to sludge thanks to corporate pollution.\n\nThere are 30 key tenets in the Sonic bible,\n\nand I'm just gonna go ahead and list them off real quick.\n\njust a big ol' mess of words from the Sonic bible\n\nThe 30 tenets of the Sonic the Hedgehog bible.\n\nLook at 'em up there.\n\nBeautiful.\n\nPractically glowing with potential energy.\n\nThe potential energy I shall release into a HOLY FLAME, SO THAT I MIGHT BURN OUT THE\n\nBLASPHEMY FROM SONIC'S MODERN ITERATIO...\n\nPat I think, uh, we should probably just take a couple minutes, just to, just to like...\n\nBrian Okay.\n\nPat I'll... do you need water or anything\n\nBrian Water... yeah, I think that'd be good.\n\nNow, most of these are not found in most of the iterations of Sonic, but there are three\n\nthat specifically decanonize every game in the Sonic franchise.\n\nLet's talk about 'em.\n\nNumber 18 There are seven chaos emeralds, one is a stabilizer.\n\nYou might have heard me say the name Kintobor.\n\nHe turns into Dr. Robotnik after he is fused the powers of the chaos emeralds and a hard-boiled egg.\n\nNot a joke.\n\nBut he was originally looking for the chaos emeralds so that we he could bundle them up\n\nand then launch them into space, thus reversing all pollution on the planet Earth.\n\nThe reason for that is because the Chaos Emeralds “contain a microlytic copy of all the inert\n\nenergy of every gross and disgusting impulse or deed done by humans since the beginning of time.”\n\nIgnoring that microlytic is the name of a company and not an actual scientific term,\n\nthis seems to state that the chaos emeralds are just a crystalline form of every gross impulse.\n\nEvery time you pick your nose instead of using a tissue.\n\nThat’s in the emerald.\n\nEvery time you wear your underwear five times in a week 'cause you think it doesn't smell that bad.\n\nThat's in the emerald.\n\nEvery time you go three days without shampooing\n\nI get it.\n\nLook, sometimes, you know, the shampoo has sulfates and that can damage to your hair.\n\nWe all have different scalps.\n\nBUT THAT'S IN THE EMERALD, TOO.\n\nMost of the games just state the chaos emeralds are an incredible source of power, something\n\nthat will help you to take over the world or become Super Sonic.\n\nThey don't ever mention that they are essentially just garbage diamonds.\n\nHad Sega included one piece of flavor text, like “You got a chaos emerald.\n\nYou should probably go wash your hands, now.”\n\nThen it would’ve been fine.\n\nBut they didn’t.\n\nNumber 21 Kintobor was a father figure.\n\nJust as a reminder, Sonic’s dad died in a vat\n\nof toxic waste.\n\nWhich is why it meant so much when Kintobor offered him an assistantship.\n\n“Sonny was thrilled at the prospect.\n\nBecause although Sonny had never known his father, Kintobor reminded him of the kind\n\nface in the photograph.”\n\nHeartbreaking.\n\nCan you imagine the drama in this\n\nSega, you keep trying to do these gritty reboots of Sonic.\n\nSonic plus gun.\n\nSonic plus getting kissed by a human woman.\n\nYou don’t need all that.\n\nIt's all right here!\n\nYou are literally pitting Sonic, a hedgehog without a father, against the man who became\n\nhis father figure and then turned evil thanks to the machines that SONIC HELPED CREATE.\n\nI hear you saying, “Brian, there’s no evidence that Sonic doesn’t think of Robotnik\n\nas a father figure!”\n\nAnd to that I say bullSHIT.\n\nI have NEVER SEEN HIM CRY AFTER DEFEATING ROBOTNIK.\n\nI HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM HOLD THE LIFELESS BODY OF HIS FATHER FIGURE AND SAY,\n\nI am sorry it had to turn out like this!\n\nI am sorry!\n\nLET SONIC CRY OVER THE LOSS OF WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN, SEGA.\n\nYOU COWARDS.\n\nAnd finally, the third and most important tenet that destroys the entirety of the Sonic canon.\n\nNumber 11 Sonic helps quilters.\n\nHave you ever seen Sonic in a quilting circle\n\nCause he should be there.\n\n“While making the rounds for juicy tidbits and gossip, he would drop in on the ladies\n\nof the local quilting circle to offer a convenient pin or needle from his ample, portable supply.”\n\nWHERE IS MY SONIC GAME WITH A QUILTING CIRCLE\n\nSonic CD shitty.\n\nSonic Mania trash.\n\nSonic Hedgehog 2.\n\nMore like Sonic the Hedgehog Too MUCH OF A DUNCE TO INCLUDE TO THE QUILTING CIRCLE THAT\n\nIS SO INTEGRAL TO SONIC'S BACKSTORY!\n\nAnd with that, we have decanonized the entirety of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise.\n\nBut from this scorched earth can bloom a mighty flower.\n\nThe true Sonic the Hedgehog.\n\nWhat would that video game look like\n\nWhat are the ramifications of a Sonic the Hedgehog game based on the bible\n\nThe Sonic the Hedgehog bible.\n\nLet’s go through this piece by piece.\n\nWe start the game with a legitimate hedgehog who lives in a hedge and his name is Sonny.\n\nAnd it's 2019, and he's got brown quills, and they won't become blue until he gets faster.\n\nAnd he eats food that is similar to the food that I eat.\n\nHe lives in Hardly, Nebraska, which is where the entire game is set, so you better get ready\n\nfor running in lots of corn fields.\n\nHis eyesight’s not good, but it’s okay cause he’ll get rec specs since he is able\n\nto read but is also on the track team.\n\nSo the entire game is actually just running in track meets in the middle of a corn field.\n\nWhen he’s not running track, he’s at the bowling alley or the playground or the quilting\n\ncircle doing normal hedgehog things.\n\nThe problem is that his town has SO MUCH POLLUTION, which is how his dad died, and it’s also\n\nwhy Kintobor (now Robotnik), the trim kindly scientist who gave Sonic his new nickname\n\nand the ability to speak the human tongue, was trying to solve with his new physics theories\n\nand his machines and all of those terrible gross seven chaos emeralds before he became\n\nevil and also a bit of an egg.\n\nThis is especially rough because Kintobor, before he became Robotnik, would feed Sonic\n\nreally good food and was basically a father figure to him.\n\nAlso Sonic is good at computer science.\n\nSo the game is basically an evil polluting scientist being taken down by a midwestern\n\nteenage hedgehog track star with daddy issues.\n\nSo it’s basically if the CW rebooted Sonic.\n\nReach out to me, CW, I will license this.\n\nBut I haven’t used all 30 of these tenets.\n\nSee, there are four of them that, to be perfectly honest, shouldn’t be possible.\n\nAnd beyond that, they are impossible to put into a game.\n\nI've hit a bit of a roadblock.\n\nNumber seven shows Sonic's dead father winking at him through a picture on the wall, which\n\nproves the existence of an afterlife in the Sonic Universe.\n\nNumber 15 shows that Sonic is able to hibernate below delta waves.\n\nAnd those are the slowest possible brain waves.\n\nAbout 0.5 hertz.\n\nTo go below them, Sonic would have probably died.\n\nAnd yet he is resurrected and lives again.\n\nAnd number 24, Sonic is shown to run at the speed of light.\n\nAnd if the rules of relativity are to be believed, that means his mass would have to infinitely\n\nexpand, and he would need infinite energy to do this.\n\nAnd that would destroy the world.\n\nAnd yet he is able to do that without harming himself or those around him.\n\nNumber 30 is actually within the bible itself.\n\nIt states, “But like most peaceful times in the twenty-first century, it didn’t last long.”\n\nThis bible was written in 1991, nine years before the twenty-first century, and yet it\n\nprophesied our challenging political landscape.\n\nThese four pieces of information are not purely canonical information.\n\nThey are...\n\ndivine miracles.\n\nSo of course I could not put them into a game.\n\nThey could only fit in a religion.\n\nSo I went on to wikiHow, the foremost explainer of how to do things, and I knew somewhere,\n\nhidden in their beautiful imagery would be the way that I could spread the word of Sonic\n\nto the masses.\n\nAnd before you get upset with me, saying,\n\nBrian, aren't you just starting a cult\n\nLook at this question answered by Cutegirlcorr\n\nTechnically speaking, religions and cults are the same thing.\n\nSo I have formed my religion around Sonic the Hedgehog.\n\nAnd guess what\n\nI have a confession!\n\nI'VE NEVER PLAYED A SONIC GAME.\n\nNEVER IN MY LIFE.\n\nI only tell you this now because you've already made it this far into the video,\n\nand the sunk cost fallacy states that if you feel like you've invested something,\n\nyou're gonna see it through to the end.\n\nBut it's okay that I haven't played a Sonic game.\n\nBecause that means I haven't been tainted!\n\nI have never beheld the false Sonic!\n\nOnly someone blind to the modern blasphemies of the Sonic franchise\n\ncould see as clearly as I!\n\nBecause if a hedgehog could commune with the dead,\n\nbe resurrected,\n\nrun with infinite energy,\n\nand HAVE HIS GOSPEL PROPHECY THE FUTURE,\n\nTHEN EITHER SONIC IS A GOD\n\nOR COULD KILL GOD\n\nAND I DO NOT CARE IF THERE IS A DIFFERENCE!\n\nHello, friends, I’d like to take a moment now and apologize for my recent outburst.\n\nI’ve taken some time and cooled down since filming this video, and though I suppose I\n\ncould have just not uploaded it to YouTube, I decided it would serve well as a cautionary tale.\n\nYou see, taking lore to be purely literal, whether that's for a video game or backstory\n\nfor a TV show, is a dangerous rabbit hole that can often lead to anger.\n\nBiblical literalism is just an early form of fandom.\n\nSometimes, you gotta be a little bit more lenient.\n\nBecause sometimes, the bible was written to make a character\n\nmore marketable to kids in the '90s.\n\nSo let’s learn from this example, and make sure to take new additions to our favorite things in stride.\n\nEven if it’s these legs.\n\nI’m sorry, I can't in good conscience agree with that.\n\nI do not agree with those legs.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nI could spr... if you spray painted my legs blue, I could cosplay as this Sonic.\n\nDo you think I should do that\n\nDo you think I should spray paint my legs blue for a Sonic cosplay\n\nJust half...\n\nJust half, half down Sonic.\n\nNot gonna do anything else to my body, just...\n\nWhat are the ramifications of a Sonic the Hedgehog game based on the bible\n\neveryone loses it ", ' Stamina! That mysterious green juice that powers our muscles.\n\nIn video games, it allows characters to cleave dragons, climb volcanoes,\n\nand lightly jog through a prairie.\n\nI look at these heroic tasks, and I think…\n\nHow?\n\nLook, I’m usually pretty high energy, but the fact of the matter is that\n\nI’ve been stuck at home for the past two months\n\nand I’ve cultivated the stamina of a cartoon basset hound.\n\nI used to be so much more productive, and my energy has just completely vanished.\n\nIs it because I’ve been having trouble adjusting to this new working-from-home lifestyle?\n\nOr is it because my build is trash?\n\nToday, I’m saying goodbye to that boring, languid Brian, and I am going to use the things I’ve learned\n\nfrom video games to maximize my stamina.\n\n*synth music*\n\nI gotta go ham on these graphics ‘cause I don’t have a studio anymore.\n\nThere are two main ways that stamina is represented in video games:\n\nstamina bars that automatically replenish, and stamina bars that don’t.\n\nAnd these different representations lead to different techniques for boosting that stamina.\n\nMy hypothesis is that if I use these same stamina techniques in real life,\n\nthen I will finally have the energy to address laundry chair.\n\n*Sad accordion music*\n\nThere are four methods of augmenting your stamina in video games.\n\nLet’s start with the easiest one to understand. Item Refills.\n\nYou expend some energy, you eat something to replenish that energy. It\'s basic biology.\n\nThe Krebs cycle or something like that…\n\nI am not interested, get that shit outta here.\n\nThe problem is that most video games are usually more fantastical than real life.\n\nOftentimes the item you need to consume is an elixir made from arcane magicks\n\nsiphoned from the very lifeblood that sustains our world.\n\nOr, if you’re Hideo Kojima, it’s Monster Energy.\n\nGod bless you Death Stranding for having a magical canteen\n\nthat effortlessly turns dangerous Timefall into a branded energy drink.\n\nYou know, for a video game that loves to give you a 40-minute-long cutscene\n\nexplaining why some dipshit is named "HOTWETMAN" or whatever,\n\nthis piece of world building has a much simpler explanation:\n\nMONEY.\n\nAnd thanks to this shameless product placement, I have a concrete way to determine how to refill stamina.\n\nJudging by Sam’s experience, it takes about 600 milliliters of Monster Energy to fully juice your bar.\n\nAnd given the fact that this logic exists in a world where everyone is stuck in isolated homes\n\nand delivery people are among the most important of essential workers,\n\nI think it’s safe to say that conditions could not be better suited for this experiment.\n\nThe biggest difference between me and Sam Bridges is that I’m not getting paid by Monster Energy,\n\nso I don’t have to pretend to like it.\n\nTechnique 2: Slowing Depletion.\n\nUnlike item refills, this one asks you to do some planning.\n\nYou only consume one of these items before you have to do a huge task,\n\nso it usually shows up in games where preparation is key,\n\nlike when you have to go fight a 40-ton pickle.\n\nMonster Hunter has battles that can last upwards of an hour,\n\nwhich can make the preparation as important, and as long, as the actual fight itself.\n\nKinda like eating a full pasta bake before the big track meet.\n\nThere are quite a few ways to slow stamina depletion in Monster Hunter,\n\nbut sometimes the simplest option is the best one,\n\nand in this case, the simplest option is steak.\n\nSteak is made from raw meat in Monster Hunter\n\n— and also the real world —\n\nand if you eat it, it boosts your max stamina.\n\nBut the effects change based on how you cook it.\n\nA rare steak refills your stamina bar and makes it longer,\n\nbut a well-done steak does all that AND it slows your max stamina depletion.\n\nThe steak snobs among you may turn up your nose at the assertion\n\nthat a well-done meat is better than a wet, juicy, rare one…\n\nBut I posit to you this question:\n\nWhich one would you rather have jangling around in your leather satchel?\n\nSo I’ll be cooking these meats until they are all-the-way gray.\n\nTechnique 3: Stamina Regeneration.\n\nWith this technique, every time you use stamina, you’ll get it back faster.\n\nAnd there is no game that makes you say,\n\n“come on refill come on come ON COME ON COME ON REFI-”\n\nmore than Dark Souls.\n\nIn Dark Souls you consume stamina every time you attack, block, run, parry, roll, backstep,\n\nbackstab, ripost, jump, shoot arrows, call your mom, check your bank account…\n\nAnd if you’re in the middle of a boss fight and you have run out of the stamina necessary\n\nto dodge roll or swing your big sword,\n\nwell, them’s the breaks, kid.\n\nLuckily, there are some accessories that speed up that stamina regeneration.\n\nAnd even more luckily, you can purchase legitimate versions of these items for about... 300 bucks.\n\nUh, no thank you. I can make that at home.\n\nAnd even if I did have the means to purchase these official props,\n\nthere’s still one massive problem.\n\nThe in-game items are imbued with dark, abyssal magicks\n\nthat I simply do not have the arcane wisdom to conjure.\n\nLuckily, I do have one little piece of magic I can use.\n\nIt’s called: The placebo effect!\n\nThere are plenty of psych studies that show that clothing choices\n\ncan have an effect on our mood and your confidence,\n\nand there are even more studies that show that placebos can have legitimate beneficial effects,\n\nso why wouldn’t donning The Mask of the Child help me deal with laundry chair?\n\n*More sad accordion music*\n\nAnd finally, technique 4: Permanent Increases.\n\nThis is by far the best way to maximize your stamina.\n\nWhen you’ve got all the stamina in the world, even the heaviest of tasks won’t phase you.\n\nThere are plenty of realistic games that use this technique, like Red Dead Redemption 2,\n\nwhere the only way to increase your max stamina is to do a bunch of stamina heavy tasks, like sprinting.\n\nBut the thing about this technique is that…\n\nIT SUCKS.\n\nUH, I’M SORRY?! You’re telling me that in order to have more energy,\n\nI have to use up all the little energy I have? That’s recursive logic.\n\nI don’t have any energy to begin with, and you want me to run a mile? Bullshit!\n\nSo since Rockstar doesn’t actually care about realism, let’s talk about a more grounded game:\n\nBreath of the Wild.\n\nIn this game, Link can trade four spirit orbs to increase his hearts or his stamina.\n\nBut I want to focus on this little guy, the Horned Statue.\n\nHere, you can do a different sort of trade… a devil’s bargain. You can increase your max stamina...\n\nYOU JUST HAVE TO GIVE UP SOME LIFE.\n\nThe only problem is that I can\'t figure out how I would gain more stamina\n\nby doing something physically detrimental, like using a shampoo with sulfates.\n\nI would never do that.\n\nSo for now, I’ll be focusing on the first three techniques.\n\nHere’s how the experiment will go: I will spend one day on each technique,\n\nrating my stamina level every hour of that day.\n\nIf I’m at a 0, then I’m either sleeping or dead, so most of my stamina levels will be between 1 and 10,\n\nwith a 1 being the stamina level of a hotboxed sloth,\n\nand a 10 being the energy of a 6-year-old at a laser tag party who just finished his first can of mello yello.\n\nMy goal is to be at a level 10 at all times.\n\nI’ll also be rating the boosts based on three criteria: Boost speed, Boost endurance, and Boost Quality.\n\nBut first, we have to do a control trial. Which is just a normal day.\n\n“Just after 7 o\'clock on a Monday. I\'d say my power level is at a 5. I\'m about to have some coffee."\n\nI went about my day as I normally do, which is to say, boringly.\n\nIf we take a look at this graph, you’ll see that there were two little spikes.\n\nThe first one, which happened after I had my morning coffee,\n\nand the second one after I hit a real low spot right after lunch.\n\nI have no idea if I’m pointing to the right places.\n\n“It\'s half past one. I decided to be productive by at least leaving my house.\n\nGonna go buy a liter of Monster.\n\nYou can\'t tell because I\'m wearing a mask, but I\'m grimacing under here."\n\nThis is obviously just one control trial,\n\nbut it is emblematic of the lethargy I’ve been feeling for the past few weeks.\n\nI never got above an 8, and in fact my average for the full day\n\nwas just a little bit higher than how I was feeling right after I woke up. That’s pretty bad.\n\nBut it means there\'s nowhere to go but up.\n\nAnd I’ll be going WAY UP with the first technique trial.\n\n“Feeling about a 5, not super tired, not super energetic.\n\nBut instead of making coffee, I instead will go and take a swig from my canteen,\n\nwhich I have filled up with three different Monster Energy drinks, up to the liter mark.\n\nIf I\'m at halfway through my stamina right now, I should be drinking 300 milliliters. Let\'s see if this kicks in!"\n\nAnd the effects of Sam Bridges’ favorite concoction did, indeed, kick in. "8 o\'clock!\n\nLet\'s, okay, obviously the energy drink has, uh, affected me. Let me put this down so I\n\ncan move around with my hands. I can still have more stamina. Yeah, I feel like I\'m at\n\nan 8 right now. You know normally I\'d say that that\'s fine. I\'m trying to be at the\n\npeak performance level. Another 120 milliliters down the hatch. Let\'s do some work, baby!\n\n*singing* Don\'t mind me, just gonna do some work right now. Feeling fine! Probably a 9.\n\nOr maybe a 9 and a half! Maybe a 10? Probably... I\'ll, mmm, 9 and a half. Can we get waffle\n\nfries? Does anyone deliver waffle fries? NO FILMING! Let\'s go write more scripts!" Things\n\nwere going great for me in the stamina department. Until they weren’t. *incoherent mumbling*\n\n"The crash, and then right after eating lunch has kind of... just brought the whole thing\n\ndown to a 3. Now that I have seen that Monster gives me a super high and then immediately\n\ncrashes me, I’m going to do the only thing a sane person would do, and consume more monster\n\nenergy. Let\'s go to work!” And though I went searching for that magnificent, full\n\nstamina feeling I fleetingly experienced in that morning, I still averaged less than the\n\ncontrol trial for the rest of the afternoon. I drank 3 full cans of Monster Energy.\n\n“If I hadn’t had the monster energy, would I have been dead right now? I don\'t understand.”\n\nThere was only one little spike that happened after I had to go outside to pick up steaks\n\nfor the next day’s trials, and though the energy drinks didn’t keep me up all night,\n\nthere were some other side effects, that ultimately led to a bad review of this technique. “My\n\nbody is tired, but my mind is just, there\'s some anxieties in there? And also I feel,\n\nlike, physically not great." Still I had high hopes for Trial 2. Since the previous two\n\ntrials trended downward, I had hoped that Slowing Depletion would help. Unfortunately,\n\ndue to the previous day’s trials, I was operating at a deficit. "Went to bed alright\n\nand then I woke up about 2 hours after that, and then kept waking up every 30 minutes.\n\nI\'ll tell you what, more than anything in the world, what I would love to do is go ahead\n\nand brew myself a pot of coffee, but you know what, I’ll do you one better.\n\nSuper cheap, beef eye-round steak.\n\nI’m gonna ahead and grill one of these puppies up to a healthy 160 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nLet’s get some breakfast going.”\n\nI tried my best to go into this experience unbiased, and honestly, the first steak of the day wasn’t that bad.\n\n“I feel more powerful."\n\nAnd though it didn’t give me quite the same bump as the Monster Energy,\n\nmy stamina levels rose and stayed level for the entire morning.\n\n“It feels like I\'m maintaining it a lot better.\n\nMaybe I really am not degrading my stamina. It is almost lunchtime.\n\nMaybe I\'ll eat two well-done medallions of steak."\n\nThat’s exactly what I did. Sadly, the second meats of the day were not as wonderful,\n\nand this is where the true challenge of this technique came in.\n\n“I do really wish I was eating something other than this.\n\nThe problem is that I\'m still very hungry, and... but I also don\'t want to eat any more well-done steaks.”\n\nWith my stomach rumbling and my stamina flagging, I decided to try to take my mind off it by\n\nworking on the accessories for the next day’s trials. And this did give me a little stamina boost,\n\nand that stamina maintained, but other things weren’t going so hot.\n\n“Great, stamina’s going alright, but I am so hungry,\n\nand also so upset with idea that I have to eat more of these well-done pucks of meat.\n\nBut I\'m gonna make the last two!\n\nNow a lot of you might be wondering, doesn’t it get easier over time?\n\nAnd the answer is obviously no.”\n\nBy the end of the day, it\'s easy to see that though my stamina didn\'t get quite as high,\n\nit did last longer, so there might be some truth to this slowing degradation technique.\n\nBut unlike the Monster Energy trial,\n\nthis one was both literally and metaphorically harder to swallow.\n\nThere’s a reason energy drinks aren’t chewable.\n\nLuckily, our final trial didn’t make me consume anything.\n\n“I slept a little bit better last night, at least, so I\'d say I\'m at, like, a 4.\n\nBut the goodnews is that I know just what to do. Let me go put on my accessories.\n\nI already feel energized.”\n\nOkay, full disclosure, as much as I believe video game logic,\n\nI did just tape some tin foil onto some cardboard.\n\nI wasn’t expecting much from this trial.\n\nBut the results speak for themselves.\n\n“Why don’t I carry around a shield more often!\n\nThis makes me feel so powerful!”\n\nI had a morning boost that rivaled Item Refills!\n\nSure, working in full garb was a little bit annoying,\n\nbut that didn’t stop me from being an active participant in my virtual meetings.\n\n"Yeah, I can, I can help out with that, Jenna, if you need any extra help on that one."\n\nJenna - "Yeah, Brian. I guess so."\n\nBut around 11, the mask and shield were getting to me,\n\nso I started altering which of the accessories I was wearing.\n\nThere’s no set bonus, so as long as I have one item equipped,\n\nmy stamina regeneration should be a little bit faster than normal.\n\n“For the past hour, I took off the mask, and I’ve just been living on the Chloranthy Ring.\n\nI do feel more tired. I\'m gonna rethink about the mask."\n\nAt 1:30, I had to do a stream, and I did that in the mask.\n\nAnd sure enough, my stamina was boosted after that experience.\n\nIn fact for most of the day, the accessories helped and didn’t make my stomach hurt,\n\nbut there were other costs.\n\n“I don’t like wearing this mask.\n\nI feel like my stamina has increased. But it seems like there\'s an obvious trade off going on here,\n\nbecause, like, it\'s not, it’s not comfortable to wear. You can see, like, it\'s been squishing my nose.\n\nI’m deciding whether or not I want to have higher energy levels or if I want to feel comfortable,\n\nis really what\'s happening at the moment."\n\nTake a look right there.\n\nI imagine that the Wright Brothers wore a similar expression the day they went to Kitty Hawk,\n\nbecause that is the face of a man who is ready to soar.\n\nRemember how I said I couldn’t figure out how to trade health for stamina?\n\nWell judging from these previous trials,\n\neach one of them was physically detrimental in a specific and wonderful way.\n\n"I feel, like, physically not great."\n\n"Why am I still so hungry?"\n\n"It\'s not comfortable to wear."\n\nPerhaps I could trade my health for more stamina by doing every technique at once.\n\nWelcome to The Final Trial!\n\n“Waking up this morning and realizing what I was going to have to do today\n\nreally just made me not want to get out of bed.\n\nI am about to do all three stamina things at once.\n\nI’m not expecting it to feel good, but I am expecting\n\nan increase in productivity unlike... anyone has ever seen from me.”\n\nSo after donning my outfit and grilling up a well-done steak,\n\nI sat down for breakfast.\n\n“God I hate this steak.”\n\nAnd by 9 o’clock, I felt the effects.\n\n“I think maybe god didn’t intend for us to wake up and drink an energy drink\n\nand eat a well-done steak and then wear a tin foil mask.\n\nI’m at a 5.”\n\nOkay, so the boost didn’t happen right away,\n\nbut let’s remember that some of these boosts take a while to warm up.\n\nAnd given the fact that I\'m increasing my max stamina,\n\nI should be hitting a 10, maybe an 11 or 12, by midmorning.\n\nExcept things didn’t change.\n\n“It\'s 10 o\'clock and I\'m still at a 5. What the hell?\n\nI\'m just gonna cook all the steaks, I\'m gonna drink all the energy drink, I\'m gonna wear this while I\'m doing it.\n\nI\'m just gonna do it all right now. I\'m tired of this. I\'m also physically tired."\n\nI ate four steaks.\n\nI drank all of the rest of my energy drink.\n\nI was GOING to increase my maximum stamina.\n\n“I’m ready to take on the day.”\n\n*pained moan*\n\nIt turns out that doing every single stamina boosting technique at once fills your stamina bar so full,\n\nthat the bar explodes.\n\nI felt physically ill and had to lie down for several hours.\n\nI can’t even review this boost technique because it just knocked me unconscious.\n\nBut I will say that I did rebound later that day.\n\n“So I left my house.\n\nCame out here to take a little walk while maintaining adequate social distance.\n\nI feel... I feel a WHOLE lot better.\n\nYou can\'t tell, but I\'m smiling under this."\n\nAnd this made me rethink some of my trials.\n\nMost of my afternoon boosts weren’t due to gimmicky ingestibles, they were because I took a small walk,\n\nor I did a fun craft, or I talked to my friends online.\n\nWas I doing these techniques for nothing?\n\nIs video game logic wrong?\n\nNo.\n\nI just didn\'t understand what video games were teaching me.\n\nGetting good at Dark Souls or Monster Hunter is about knowing how many swings of your big sword\n\nyou can do before you need to take a break.\n\nIt only becomes a major issue if you completely run out, and you have to spend a few seconds staggered,\n\nor spend a few hours lying in bed.\n\nMaybe the real stamina technique I need to learn is recognizing that, right now,\n\nI may not be able to do as much as I want to.\n\nBut if I focus on the little wins,\n\nI can manage my stamina, and I can manage my expectations for my stamina.\n\nSo although I may still wear the Chloranthy Ring, it will just be for the fashion.\n\nAnd today, I’m gonna take care of laundry chair.\n\nYou tell me when the camera stops rolling so I can stop folding.\n\n*SYNTH BANGER* ', ' WALUIGI.\n\nThe tall bastard man that Nintendo loves to disrespect. We know he\'s number one.\n\nBut who really is he? And where did he come from?\n\nAnd why hasn’t Nintendo given him his own game.\n\nThe cult following of Waluigi cannot be overstated. He is an icon.\n\nThe patron saint of weird content creators.\n\nBut isn’t it strange that this character so beloved by Nintendo fans\n\nseems to be completely disregarded by the company?\n\nI don’t believe that’s actually the truth.\n\nNintendo cares almost too much about their characters.\n\nThey rarely put a character into a game unless they\'re 100% sure it’s a good fit.\n\nAnd I think this is the reason why Waluigi has been sidelined:\n\nNintendo doesn’t know what Waluigi is all about.\n\nSo, Doug Bowser, I have collected every single piece of Waluigi lore into this one\n\nsimple video, and I’ll be presenting it to you, so you can finally make that Waluigi game.\n\nWahaha!\n\nThat was my first attempt, I\'ll get better.\n\nIn order to understand Waluigi perfectly,\n\nwe have to take a look at every appearance he\'s made in a Nintendo game.\n\nThey’re the only ones that count toward canon.\n\nIf you\'d like me to discuss Waluigi\'s noncanonical appearances, I can definitely do that for you, Doug,\n\nit\'ll just have to be in my off hours\n\nbecause it is DEFINITELY not safe for work.\n\nHere’s every Waluigi appearance sorted by release date.\n\nThese 63 games contain the entirety of Waluigi’s characterization.\n\nHe is playable in 50 of them, and we can split those playable games into Sports and Party Games.\n\nI combed through each of these appearances, grasping at any piece of Waluigi characterization,\n\nbut the vast majority of them treat Waluigi as a meat puppet. A space filler.\n\nAn extra body on the character select screen. And, honestly, that’s one way to see Waluigi.\n\nI hear you, Doug Bowser. Why should I care about a space filler character?\n\nWell, you already care about a space filler character.\n\nA little fella named Mario.\n\nLet’s discuss Waluigi’s counterparts to shed some light on his origin.\n\nThe original Donkey Kong was supposed to have Popeye characters, but Nintendo couldn’t get the license,\n\nso Shigeru Miyamoto created an unnamed player character as a stand in.\n\nAnd that space filler was later named Mario.\n\nPeople think that characters have to have some deep backstory in order for people\n\nto like them, but that’s NOT TRUE. People love Mario BECAUSE of his humble origins.\n\nThe same cannot be said about the rightfully despised coward boy that is Luigi.\n\nYou see, Luigi was made because they needed a player 2 in the game, so they just palette swapped Mario.\n\nThat is a character filling a space by copying another filled space.\n\nAs much as I hate to admit it, I will have to revisit Luigi later in this video,\n\nbecause he is key to developing the personality of Waluigi, and that\'s partially because of Wario.\n\nWario wasn’t made by Miyamoto. Supposedly, the team behind Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins\n\ndidn’t enjoy being forced to make a Mario game because they didn’t create the character.\n\nSo Hiroji Kiyotake created a bad Mario, someone that had all of Mario\'s evils exaggerated.\n\nAnd finally, we have Waluigi, who was created by the same character designer who worked on Golden Sun.\n\nThe guy who made Saturos and Isaac and all of these intense powerful characters\n\nused his talents to make the most intense, most powerful character.\n\nAnd he made him for a very important reason:\n\nbecause Wario didn’t have a doubles partner in Mario Tennis.\n\nIf Wario is just the evil exaggerated form of Mario, then Waluigi\'s the same for Luigi.\n\nAnd that’s really all we get from Waluigi’s first encounter.\n\nThat, and the fact that Luigi is not afraid of him.\n\n*Mario Tennis music plays*\n\n"Luigi not afraid."\n\nLuigi, the milksop who is afraid of all, is not afraid of his evil, funhouse mirror twin.\n\nThere’s something to that, but I don\'t know if I can quite grasp it without discussing all of the lore first.\n\nSo let’s switch back here.\n\nAs I mentioned before the tangent, Waluigi often plays the role of meat puppet,\n\nso not all of these games have lore that is useful to us in developing a Waluigi game.\n\nSo I’ll take them off the board.\n\nAfter cutting, we\'re left with 5 references to Waluigi, 7 party games, and 13 sports games.\n\nFrom these 25 appearances, we can take all the juicy morsels and put them into a list of Waluigi Truths.\n\nLet’s start with the references.\n\nThough Super Smash has notoriously snubbed our large purple child,\n\nthe trophies do a pretty good job of fleshing out his character.\n\nSuper Smash Bros. Melee lays out 8 Waluigi Truths in just three sentences:\n\nFour things right there: Tall. Thin. Evil looking. “Seems” to be Luigi’s rival.\n\nThat one isn’t really definitive, so we’ll keep it ambiguous.\n\nWaluigi is a mischief maker, and he takes it seriously.\n\nLuigi is exactly the same age as Waluigi, and I do not know who that reflects worse on.\n\nAlso, I love that Waluigi is connected to Wario, but no one\'s ever cared to take a closer look.\n\nAre they friends, accomplices,\n\nlovers?\n\nIt’s unclear!\n\nThe next Smash games really hammer home these truths,\n\nonly adding that he must also have a crooked mustache, a large nose, and a love of kicking.\n\nHmm.\n\n*crashing noise*\n\nThe final reference comes from Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle,\n\nwhere a large rabbid called Bwaluigi appears.\n\nThis is the closest Waluigi has ever come to appearing in a plot-based Mario game.\n\nA fucking rabbid has had more screen time than the original Waluigi.\n\nWhat can we learn from this?\n\nAs we move onto the party games, a lot of Waluigi’s lore is reiterated.\n\nThe main additions are that he is a misanthrope who loves to party.\n\nThere are two strange pieces of info in the party games.\n\nIn Mario Party 5, each pairing gets a different team name, and Mario plus Waluigi are “Psuedo Bros.”\n\nNot enemies.\n\nIt seems like Mario is okay working with Waluigi instead of Luigi.\n\nThe second weird piece of info is in Mario Party 4, where Waluigi is described with the quote:\n\n“That Waluigi\'s a serious sneak! Watch out for his Sparky Sticker..."\n\nThis quote doesn’t have any useful info for us, but the phrase “watch out for his sparky sticker”\n\nis the worst and I hate it and why’d you put it in a family friendly video game, Nintendo?\n\nFinally, we have the Sports games, where Waluigi started.\n\nMario Tennis set the tone for Waluigi with two truths.\n\nOne, that he’s highly skilled as a technique player. And two, that Luigi is not afraid of him.\n\nThis one\'s still weird to me.\n\nThese ones all have quotes that reiterate what we know about Waluigi.\n\nHe\'s hardworking and he\'s skilled, even if he cheats sometimes.\n\nWe have some metaphysical characterization in Super Mario Strikers, where the legend states\n\n“Waluigi\'s ego tends to be his biggest enemy.”\n\nIn Mario Hoops 3-on-3, his Baller Name is “The Question.”\n\nWhich I think just solidifies him as an enigma.\n\nMario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games shows that Waluigi is a great jumper,\n\nand Waluigi’s special move in Mario Super Sluggers is the Liar Ball, which is a ball that\n\nhe splits into two copies, one real and one false,\n\nwhich emphasizes his mischievousness.\n\nIn Mario Power Tennis, there is a blooper reel where Waluigi is aware that this is all a show.\n\nDoes this mean that Waluigi is able to break the fourth wall,\n\nor does it prove what I already knew,\n\nthat Waluigi is great on camera.\n\nIt\'s hot under these lights, anyone else hot in here? I\'m just gonna pop this bad boy off if that\'s okay.\n\n*crashing sound*\n\nAnd in Mario Tennis: Power Tour, Waluigi appears without Wario.\n\nTheir relationship was never clear, but it is surprising that Waluigi, who was built to be Wario’s tennis partner,\n\ncan appear in a tennis game without him.\n\nLuigi’s still there. Why can’t Waluigi exist without Luigi, save us all a headache.\n\nAnd that’s basically all of the Waluigi lore you can learn from the games. The 23 Waluigi Truths.\n\nAnd you can use them to create a Waluigi video game.\n\nAnd I could stop this video here, Doug,\n\nbut I’ll tell you what, I\'ll do you a favor.\n\nI\'ll tell you what I think the Waluigi game should look like, since I’ve done the research for ya.\n\nIf you’re gonna make a Waluigi game, you\'re gonna need to make it distinct.\n\nNintendo does a great job of tying gameplay to what makes a character special.\n\nMario’s got platformers locked. Wario has eccentric greedy microgames.\n\nLuigi...\n\nyou know what, let’s actually go through Luigi’s truths and see how it led to Luigi’s Mansion.\n\nLuigi is foolish, he\'s a coward, he\'s weak, he\'s pitiful.\n\nAnd you take these truths and you think, hmmm, what kind of setting would allow this mistake of\n\na human to really exhibit his uselessness?\n\nA haunted house!\n\nThis man has been bamboozled into comedic haunted house entrapment three times,\n\nsomething most Hollywood stooges have only been duped into once.\n\nHe’s a big dumb idiot, and I would HATE to be associated with him.\n\nBut Waluigi is Luigi’s twisted reflection, so his game will be far removed from this numpty.\n\nLet’s make it.\n\nFirst, we\'re gonna move the truths that are physical traits to the side, since they\'re baked into Waluigi.\n\nNext we have to decide on a cast of characters.\n\nHonestly, Waluigi has been sidelined for so long that this needs to be a solo mission.\n\nNow, let’s talk about the rest of these truths.\n\nIf you were to separate them out, you could probably make dozens of different games.\n\nA mischievous prank game. A, uh, game where Waluigi gets schwasty every night.\n\nAnd I’m not opposed to these games, but Waluigi contains multitudes.\n\nWhy does he turn to mischief? Why does he work so hard only to be cast aside by society?\n\nWho is this enigma of a man, whose true enemy is himself?\n\nThe Waluigi game, like the man,\n\nshould be a mystery.\n\nNintendo already has wonderful mystery games, but they’re too cute.\n\nWaluigi is raw. He\'s real. To convey the complex emotions of a complex man,\n\nwe can’t rely on traditional animation styles.\n\nThe Waluigi video game\n\nshould be Full Motion Video.\n\nDoug, I know this is a wild concept. Nintendo is not known for live action video mysteries,\n\nbut Waluigi is just the intellectual property to explore this new genre.\n\nImagine Waluigi as a hard-nosed investigator, struggling to pick apart the pieces of who he is.\n\nA man solving himself.\n\nI mean, there is the issue of casting.\n\nYou gotta find someone who’s evil looking, and has a crooked mustache,\n\nand a big nose and is great at jumping.\n\nAnd, you know, that\'s a... that\'s a hard task to find one guy who\'s got all those features, you know, I...\n\nWell now, wait a second, Doug.\n\nIf you take a look at my truths, you\'ll find that they\'re nearly the same as Waluigi\'s.\n\nI’m hard working, I’m a bit of a scamp, and though I might not be as tall and lean,\n\nthere’s enough of me that WANTS to be Waluigi that I’d devote everything to being him.\n\nI need this role, Doug.\n\nI’ve spent the past few months devising this pitch for you. No one wants this more,\n\ncares more about Waluigi than I do.\n\nI will fight Charles Martinet for this role.\n\nIs that what you want, Doug?\n\nYOU PICK THE WEAPONS.\n\nI WILL END HIS CAREER.\n\nAnd that’s why I hope you’ll consider me for Waluigi’s Currently Untitled Full Motion Video Game.\n\nBut there’s something that\'s still nagging at me.\n\nI’m sure you noticed that I didn’t address all of these Waluigi truths.\n\nWhy does every single quote state that Waluigi "thinks” he’s Luigi’s rival?\n\nYou could read this as Waluigi not being important enough for Luigi to consider him as a rival,\n\nbut why go through the trouble of putting that in EVERY SINGLE description?\n\nWhy not just make their rivalry canon?\n\nAnd the fact that Luigi is not afraid of him is mind boggling.\n\nLuigi’s personality is 90% fear and 10% being green.\n\nMario is shocked when Waluigi appears, and yet Luigi is calm,\n\nlike he somehow expected him.\n\nAnd if Waluigi thinks his biggest rival is Luigi, then how can his actual biggest enemy be his ego?\n\nDoes that make Luigi the ego to Waluigi\'s id? A-a-and if...\n\n"You can\'t have a Waluigi without a Luigi." "He splits into two copies, one real and one false."\n\n"Pseudo Bros. Not enemies." "Why can\'t Waluigi exist without Luigi?"\n\nLuigi and Waluigi are the same person.\n\n*Vesti la Giubba starts playing*\n\nIt’s so simple. Luigi is just manifesting his own repressed desires as an alternate personality,\n\na shocking twist that no one\'s ever done in media before.\n\nWaluigi is just the exaggerated form of Luigi’s deepest desires.\n\nThe want to be skilled. The want to be respected.\n\nThe want to PARTY.\n\nWaluigi is everything Luigi wishes he could be but could never be\n\nunder the famous gaze of his famous brother.\n\nWhat an amazing twist. What an amazing truth.\n\nWhat an amazing role for me as Waluigi.\n\nThink of the accolades, the game awards, the respect.\n\nAs someone who wished to be Waluigi for so many years!\n\nAs someone... who wished...\n\nIf there are two personalities, am I number one, or am I the one who is longing?\n\nOh god. I\'m not a Waluigi.\n\nI’m a Luigi.\n\nNo no no... Nonononononono!\n\n*mirror shatters*\n\n*shaver buzzes*\n\nAnd that’s just ONE potential ending to Waluigi’s Currently Untitled Full Motion Video Game.\n\nIf you’re interested in licensing the idea, Doug, feel free to reach out to my agent,\n\nand we can get filming tomorrow.\n\nOr in like… five months \'cause I am gonna have to grow the mustache back-\n\nI probably shouldn\'t have shaved it before we...\n\nYou know what, I don\'t have an agent, so just don\'t contact me.\n\nI don\'t want to play Luigi, so.\n\nPat- "Can you sob while doing it?" Brian - "Okay."\n\n*sobbing while shaving*\n\nPat - "Head back."\n\n*Brian gags and coughs* *Jenna and Pat laugh*\n\nBrian - It\'s so hard to sob while shaving because it gets in your mouth. ', ' I love the Legend of Zelda series.\n\nBut the canonical timeline doesn’t make any sense!\n\nPerhaps it would make more sense if someone tried to put every single piece of Zelda media,\n\ncanonical and noncanonical, into one timeline.\n\nSomeone should try to do that.\n\nLet’s go!\n\nLet’s start with the canonical timeline.\n\nSo we’ve got Skyward Sword at the very beginning.\n\nCreated Demise, and then he becomes Ganon later on.\n\nLink gets resurrected.\n\nIt’s Minish Cap.\n\nIt introduces Vaati.\n\nHe’s a wind sorcerer.\n\nAnd then he also shows up in Four Swords.\n\nThat comes next.\n\nAfter Four Swords, Vaati is sealed, Ganon’s back, baby!\n\nAnd it’s Ocarina of Time.\n\nSo Ocarina of Time splits into three different timelines here.\n\nIn one of them, Link decides to stay an adult, Ganondorf gets resurrected, and Link is nowhere\n\nto be found.\n\nAnd where’s Link?\n\nWhere’s Link?\n\nI’ll get to it, don’t worry, I’ll get to it.\n\nAnd then the whole world floods, and we get Wind Waker.\n\nThis one I’ll call “Adult Link.”\n\nIn this one, he decides to stay a child, the sacred realm is sealed, he’s finished his\n\nentire meaning of existence by the time he’s like 12, and so he goes and does Majora’s\n\nMask, which is also very existential.\n\nAnd then over here, Nintendo decided to make a timeline where Link loses.\n\nLink just can’t do it in this one.\n\nGanondorf does whatever the hell he wants to, and now it’s A Link to the Past.\n\nOne of my friends invited me over to watch him beat Ocarina of Time, because he was really\n\nclose to finishing it, and then I went over and then he couldn’t do it, and so then\n\nwe decided to go outside and play basketball.\n\nThis is that timeline.\n\nSo we have “Adult Link,” “Child Link,” “Basketball.”\n\nLet’s go back to “Adult Link.”\n\nAfter Wind Waker, he just goes and hangs out with pirate friends in Phantom Hourglass.\n\nWe go to Spirit Tracks.\n\nThis is on a different island, and technically there is Link and Zelda, except Link is really\n\ninto trains now.\n\nLet’s do the child one!\n\nWe go from Majora’s Mask into what is canonically called the Era of Twilight.\n\nObviously, it’s Twilight Princess next.\n\nThen it gets a little bit darker and goes into the Age of Shadow.\n\nWe do Four Swords Adventures, which is different from Four Swords.\n\nOne has Adventures in the title.\n\nHere’s some issues with canon over here in “Basketball” timeline.\n\nIn the Hyrule Historia, which came out in 2011, it states that next should be Oracle\n\nof Seasons and Oracle of Ages, but the Japanese Zelda website technically states that it goes\n\nLink to the Past, Link’s Awakening now.\n\nSo they’ve reversed those two.\n\nSo even the canonical timeline isn’t, like, super hard set-in-stone canonical, which goes\n\nto show that it sucks.\n\nHe does this thing and then he goes sailing and then he crashes and has a dream and then\n\ndies in the ocean.\n\nI’m gonna keep Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages tied together right now.\n\nA new Link, new cycle, and he goes A Link Between Worlds.\n\nAnd then it’s another existential crisis, but this is my favorite one because instead\n\nof having an existential crisis and then going to have to save the world from a moon, or\n\nhaving an existential crisis and hanging out with pirates, he just gets really into fashion\n\nin Tri Force Heroes, which is what I plan to do in my midlife crisis.\n\nIt’s The Legend of Zelda, the first one!\n\nZelda II: The Adventure of Link.\n\nThis is the same Link between these two.\n\nA cult wants to resurrect Ganon or something.\n\nWe’re at the most recent game, and the most recent in the timeline, it’s Breath of the Wild.\n\nYou might be wondering, where does Breath of the Wild fall?\n\nIn which timeline?\n\nIs it “Basketball,” is it “Child,” or is it “Adult?”\n\nWell guess what: IT’S ALL THREE.\n\nNINTENDO COULDN’T FIGURE IT OUT, SO THEY DECIDED TO JUST PUT IT IN ALL OF THE TIMELINES.\n\nWHICH ISN’T HOW TIME WORKS…\n\nTO MY KNOWLEDGE.\n\n*vague gesturing*\n\nI’m gonna make this timeline much worse, but I’m gonna also explain the convergence.\n\nSo what I’m gonna go to next is Zelda spinoff games.\n\nI’m not gonna talk about some specific things, namely cameos, or when you can buy Link’s\n\nclothing in other games, or some of the mangas because they’re just the same exact stories\n\nas some of the main canonical timeline games.\n\nI’ve wrapped all of these up.\n\nSome of them don’t have connections yet.\n\nDon’t worry, I’ll get to it.\n\nLet’s start with the easy Zelda spinoffs.\n\nThere were a lot of them during Twilight Princess.\n\nLink was also learning how to use his crossbow for big game hunting, and also it was Twilight\n\nPrincess Picross.\n\nMidna wanted to… she thought picross would help him…\n\nbeat Zant.\n\nWe’ll start from the beginning.\n\nSkyward Sword was supposed to be the first one, but they’re wrong.\n\nHylia chose her first hero, there was, like, a lot of time between the first hero and the\n\none that happened in Skyward Sword, and in that time was the Zelda Game & Watch.\n\nJust like in Skyward Sword, there was an upper level and a bottom level, and then there were\n\ndragons also in Skyward Sword.\n\nThat’s my logic behind this one.\n\nYou say “Zelda Game & Watch, what about the Zelda Game Watch?”\n\nThat’s right, the Nelsonic Zelda Game Watch.\n\nThis was a watch that you could play Zelda on, and there were only four dragons in this one.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the other Link already defeated the other ones!\n\nThere were three other dragons in Skyward Sword, and they were nice because they learned\n\nthat Link would fuck their shit up!\n\nLink: The Faces of Evil and Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon.\n\nI’m not an expert on this one because I’ve never played them.\n\nWhich I think is probably the best decision I’ve made in my life.\n\nRight over here, why?\n\nBecause in Link: The Faces of Evil he has to go to the island of Koridai.\n\nIslands?\n\nIn the great sea!\n\nObviously, that’s where they make sense to go.\n\nUh, Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon can go there, too.\n\nSQUADALA!\n\nBut that’s not the only CD-i game!\n\nThere’s also Zelda’s Adventure.\n\nGanon, I guess he stole some celestial something-or-others, and then it started the era of darkness.\n\nAnd remember what I said before about how it went to twilight and then to shadow?\n\nWhat comes after that?\n\nThat’s right it’s darkness, baby!\n\nY’all know about the Satellaview?\n\nIt was a weird thing for the SNES, or the Super Famicom because it was just in Japan.\n\nIt insisted on all of the Satellaview games including the letters BS.\n\nBS The Legend of Zelda: Kamigami no Triforce was just basically A Link to the Past, so\n\nI didn’t include it in this one.\n\nBut there are other BS Legend of Zelda games, and they’re weird because they don’t actually\n\ninclude Link.\n\nThey include these two characters that you could choose, and they technically part of\n\nthe Satellaview thing, so it wasn’t Link who was there, but… um…\n\nI’ll explain in a second.\n\nI cut one of the titles in half.\n\nClayton, we have to start over.\n\nA Link to the Past happens and then Link goes away on a journey into the water and then\n\nhe dies.\n\nWhat’s happening while Link goes on adventures is BS The Legend of Zelda.\n\nIt happens after that, during Link’s Awakening, when Link runs away, which is why those kids\n\nare the ones in this.\n\nAnd then after that it goes Link…\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Ancient Stone Tablets.\n\nAnd technically, since those kids are the ones that are in BS The Legend of Zelda, that\n\ntechnically means that they are an iteration of Link, and so BS-X: The Story of the Town\n\nWhose Name Was Stolen, which was a game that included those protagonists, but, um, didn’t\n\ninclude anything about Zelda, technically is still a Zelda game, so I included it in\n\nthis one.\n\nBarcode Battler II, you had to scan cards with a barcode and then you would have to\n\nbattle those enemies using it.\n\nA different retelling of the same story as A Link to the Past, just like looking at it\n\nfrom a different camera angle.\n\nTingle exists in actually two different timelines, and he also exists in every timeline, because\n\nTingle is, um, the perfect evolution of humanity.\n\nHe shows up in Majora’s Mask first, and he also shows up in Wind Waker.\n\nWe have an origin story for Tingle in Freshly Picked Tingle’s Rosy Rupeeland.\n\nHe starts to get the taste *mwah* I love rupees.\n\nAnd then he starts selling his maps to you in Majora’s Mask, but at the same time as\n\nRosy Rupeeland is the Dekisugi Tingle Pack, which was, uh, DSiWare, and it just basically\n\nwas like a calculator, and like a fortune teller or something.\n\nTingle’s Balloon Fight DS.\n\nThis happens at the same time as Wind Waker.\n\nOver here in “Basketball” timeline, we’ve got Ripened Tingle’s Balloon Trip of Love.\n\nI’m not gonna explain how it connects just yet, because I’ll do that later.\n\nIt’s the final Zelda spinoff.\n\nHyrule Warriors Definitive Edition, and I’m using the definitive edition because that’s\n\njust the collection of all of them, ‘cause there’s three different versions of this game.\n\nI’m gonna put Hyrule Warriors over here, and I’m gonna call this the TIME BREAK.\n\n*THE TIME BREAK*\n\nThey made three timelines already, so why can’t I make my own?\n\nHyrule Warriors is the second most important game in the entire timeline for how it ties\n\neverything together.\n\nHyrule Warriors.\n\nThink about that, Nintendo!\n\nYou made me care about Hyrule Warriors!\n\nBut we’re not done with Zelda games.\n\nWe’re gonna talk about Zelda character appearances.\n\nIf Miyamoto doesn’t, like, email me after this video goes up and say, “Brian, you’ve\n\ncracked the code!”\n\nI’m never gonna play another Zelda game ever again.\n\nThis whole goddamn suit is so tight, I feel like a Christmas ham.\n\nI haven’t connected these two right now, because in “Adult Link” timeline, Link\n\njust kinda slacks off, ‘cause he has, again, existential crisis.\n\nHe finished beating Ganon, what does he do for the rest of his life?\n\nI’ll tell you what he does: He go-karts, and he fights people…\n\nFOR SPORT.\n\nSuper Smash Bros. the original one, Mario Kart 8, and Soulcalibur II.\n\nGot nothing better to do, might as well go have fun, and you know what, I respect that,\n\nbut you did forget that Ganondorf got resurrected, and then the whole world flooded.\n\nSo that’s on your conscience.\n\nI imagine that Link still has, like, access to the Temple of Time, which is why in Super\n\nSmash Bros. Melee, it happens simultaneously in Ocarina of Time, because he can change\n\nhimself into Young Link, and also Ganondorf’s there, and I don’t know why he’s allowed\n\nto fight.\n\nI’ve put these three Super Smash Bros. after Hyrule Warriors in the TIME BREAK.\n\n*TIME BREAK*\n\nAnd while we’re hanging out in the time break…\n\nSonic’s here.\n\nSonic’s in the time break baby!\n\nI swear to god I’m not just using the time break as a catch-all, but it does work as\n\na catch-all.\n\nThere’s this weird-ass game for the Wii called Captain Rainbow.\n\nTechnically happens at the same time as Link’s Awakening because it includes Crazy Tracy,\n\nbut Link’s Awakening happens within Link’s dream, so that means that Captain Rainbow\n\nmight be happening within Crazy Tracy’s dream.\n\nSo it’s very much like Inception.\n\nAnd that means that Joseph Gordon Levitt exists in the Zelda timeline.\n\nThat’s a joke.\n\nJoseph Gordon Levitt doesn’t exist in any timeline.\n\nAnd these are also gonna come down here next to Ripened Tingle’s Balloon Trip of Love.\n\nWarioWare, all of them, and then Scribblenauts Unlimited.\n\nAnd again, I will explain that later.\n\nPhew, I’m getting too worked up about this.\n\nCanonical games, spin-offs, Zelda appearances in other games, what’s left?\n\nEvery other type of media.\n\nI swear to god if I get one “well actually…” comment.\n\nThat’s a lost cause, right?\n\nLet’s start with books.\n\nI mentioned before that Skyward Sword was not the first game and that Game & Watch was\n\nthe first game.\n\nBut it’s not the first instance of Zelda and Link.\n\nHimekawa’s Skyward Sword manga does include the origin of literally… it’s like the\n\nfirst Avatar, it’s the first Link, first Hylian chosen hero.\n\nFirst instance of Link.\n\nI really don’t know why Nintendo hasn’t included the choose-your-own-adventure books\n\nbecause they love to have things that have confusing timelines where Link could potentially\n\ndie in them, like in “Basketball” over there.\n\nThe Crystal Trap and The Shadow Prince happen canonically after the original Legend of Zelda\n\nand Zelda II.\n\nThere are, like, 11 or 12 or 18 different endings.\n\nStick with me here: you could win The Shadow Prince with high points or you could win The\n\nShadow Prince with lower points.\n\nThose are two separate timelines in my head.\n\nSo low points from The Shadow Prince, you go to the Valiant Comics, and now we’re\n\ngonna talk about TV.\n\nIf you win with high points, we go into The Legend of Zelda TV Series.\n\n“Aren’t I sweet?”\n\nAfter The Legend of Zelda TV Series, Captain N happens, and it’s weird because in this\n\none, the hero is a guy named Kevin.\n\nHe gets sucked into a television.\n\nCaptain N creates this potential option of being able to summon yourself into the game,\n\nwhich explains THESE THREE THINGS.\n\nI TOLD YOU I WOULD EXPLAIN THEM LATER!\n\nRipened Tingle’s Balloon Trip of Love starts with a dumb 35-year-old man who lives in his\n\nparents’ house and then he gets sucked into a book, and then he goes into Tingle’s land\n\nand he becomes Tingle.\n\nWarioWare shows that the Zelda games exist at the same time which is in Captain N, and\n\nalso Scribblenauts Unlimited is here, too!\n\nI haven’t necessarily figured that one out.\n\nBoard games!\n\nThere are Zelda board games, and they also deserve to be in the timeline.\n\nThe Legend of Zelda board game…\n\nThe Zelda board game happens if you die in The Crystal Trap, how does that sound?\n\nAlright?\n\nYou happy?\n\nBut what about Zelda Clue?\n\nThat’s…\n\nI guess, happens, uh, during the Super Smash Bros. time, right?\n\nBecause they’re having fun together, hanging out.\n\nZelda Chess!\n\n*exasperated look at the camera*\n\nThere’s no plotline in Zelda Chess.\n\nPut it in Ocarina of Time like everything else in this dumbass timeline.\n\nLet me double check that I’ve gotten everything…\n\nBut what about the TIME BREAK?\n\n*TIME BREAK*\n\nI told you that I would explain the time break, didn’t I?\n\nAnd I’m gonna explain it right now.\n\nWhy does no one understand the time break except for me, Brian David Gilbert?\n\nWhy am I the only scholar in time break studies?\n\nI’ll tell you why.\n\nHyrule Warriors Definitive Edition happens outside of the timeline entirely, similarly\n\nto Breath of the Wild.\n\nIt exists in all of the timelines because Ganondorf’s soul gets split into multiple\n\npieces that go into different timelines, and again, that’s in the story itself.\n\nLink figures out that there are multiple timelines in this time.\n\nAnd then he defeats the thing and he goes into existential crisis mode, just like over\n\nhere, and like over here, and like over there.\n\nBut what does he do when he knows that all

Encyclopedia.\n\nThe official listing of everything you could ever want to know about the 17 games in the\n\nmain series of Super Mario Bros.\n\nThe main series are just the platformers, none of the RPGs or spin offs.\n\nBut the silver lining to this means that I can spend a different Unraveled talking about those games.\n\nBecause God has cursed me for my hubris, and my work is never finished.\n\nOf the 17 in the main series, I’m gonna cut these three games, because they don’t\n\nhave Bowser as the main antagonist.\n\nAnd I’m also gonna include Super Mario Odyssey, because that came out after this book was published.\n\nThat leaves us with 15 games and 226 enemies.\n\nI came to this number because I cut out the variants.\n\nI cut out all of the shadow versions of Mario, the minigame enemies, the enemies that are\n\njust machines, and Bowser’s fursonas.\n\nBecause those should never be exposed to the horrors of war.\n\nNow I need to figure out how to structure this hierarchy.\n\nI asked myself, is there an analogous military that is somewhat bloated, often antagonistic,\n\nand seems to be the only thing that the leadership cares about funding?\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn’t find any real life examples of this.\n\nSo I’m loosely basing it on the US military.\n\nThat means Bowser’s military **SMACK*** will be split up into branches based on which\n\nhenchmen work best together, and I’m also going to try to fit them alongside commissioned\n\nofficers and enlisted troops.\n\nThe standard command structure that’s found in most militaries.\n\nLet’s start with the heads of state: Obviously, we have Bowser up at the top, the commander in chief.\n\nHis secretary of defense is gonna be Kamek,\n\nwith Kamella standing by as the National Security Council.\n\nWe’ve also got Bowser Jr. up here, but he’s not in a military role.\n\nHe’s actually Secretary of Transportation.\n\nBut that’s just pure nepotism.\n\nThe rest of Bowser’s henchmen are going to fit into this hierarchy, and I’m just\n\ngonna say one henchman per rank, the one that epitomizes what that rank means.\n\nAnd I’m gonna list the rest of the enemies on the screen.\n\nBecause I do want to save at least a little bit of paper.\n\nUh.\n\nObviously I don’t want to save paper that much.\n\n*paper guilt*\n\nStarting with our infantry, we have our enlisted ranks with Private Goomba.\n\nThis makes sense.\n\nIt is the basic troop.\n\nMoving up a step to the corporal, we’ve got the Galoomba.\n\nIt’s more mature than the Goomba.\n\nAnd also, its name has an extra syllable and is way more fun to yell.\n\nPat: Look at this Galoomba!\n\nBrian: LOOK AT THIS GALOOMBA!\n\nChargin’ Chuck is a great pick for sergeant class, because this troop obviously enlisted\n\nright after being their high school star quarterback and moved up through the ranks quickly.\n\nAnd now that we’re up at warrant officer, the top of the enlisted ranks.\n\nWe’ve got, it’s just a tower of Goombas.\n\nKind of like the Naval Academy’s Herndon Monument, Goombas become stronger and work\n\ntogether better when they’re standing on top of one another.\n\nMoving our way up to the commissioned officers, we start out with officer cadet.\n\nAnd that’s gonna be Twirlip.\n\nIt’s got the round, soft body of a day one ROTC recruit,\n\nbut there’s ambition in those eyes.\n\nSecond lieutenant, we’ve got the Snailicorn.\n\nIt’s the natural evolution from the officer cadet, but a bit more dangerous.\n\nBy the time you’ve reached First Lieutenant, you’ve really proved your mettle and are\n\nready to show your dedication to the cause.\n\nAnd what better way to show your dedication than to be literally shot from a cannon.\n\nBy the time you reach captain, you need to have a top-down perspective.\n\nAnd that's why the Pokey's height is great for this rank.\n\nAlso, the Pokey understands how to take calculated losses in stride, like having literally all\n\nof their torso punched out from under them and still maintaining a smile.\n\nNext we have Major Squizzard, and I’m gonna gloss over him, 'cause his name makes me uncomfortable.\n\nFor lieutenant colonel, I chose Wiggler, because they're able to maintain composure and only\n\nrelease their aggression when it's absolutely necessary.\n\nBut quick shout out to Stairface Ogre, who is also a lieutenant colonel and sounds like\n\nhe could be a member of the Wu Tang Clan.\n\nNext, we have Colonel Spike.\n\nAt the colonel rank, you’re not only dealing with wartime issues, but also the internal\n\npolitics of the military,\n\nwhich is why Spike makes time to have a few rounds of tennis with the boss.\n\nA Brigadier General needs an eye for detail and a strong guiding hand.\n\nAnd that's literally all Knucklotec is.\n\nMajor Burrows really deserves the rank of major general because he has demonstrated\n\na powerful understanding of many strategies in many different battle arenas.\n\nBut more than that, he has this tender leadership quality that makes him not only respected,\n\nbut loved by his peers.\n\nAnd then above him is a fucking T-Rex.\n\nUnfortunately, even the military hierarchy is not insulated from nepotism.\n\nAnd though no one would describe Petey Piranha as capable in literally any circumstance,\n\nhis father took a bullet for Bowser back in the Korean War, so now he’s a general.\n\nAnd finally, we have our field marshall, the five-star general.\n\nObviously, this person is going to oversee every aspect of Bowser's infantry, and it\n\nhas to be filled with the most overpowered troop.\n\nSo it's Ukiki.\n\nThis shitheel of a monkey plays dumb, but he’s the Sun Tzu of Bowser’s army.\n\nListen to these quotes:\n\nAnd that is the basic structure of Bowser’s infantry, though there are also three special\n\ndivisions of infantry units that are trained to fight in different conditions.\n\nThe Lava and the Ice divisions are still found under Field Marshal Ukiki and they don't have\n\nany enlisted troops.\n\nI won't talk too much about these two, but I think they are epitomized by the Bully for\n\nthe Lava group, and the Chill Bully for the ice group, who is exactly like the Bully,\n\nexcept he'll kind of go easy on you if he can tell you're having a rough day.\n\nAnd the third special unit in the infantry is the spectral unit, or the Dry Corps, because\n\nnot even death can excuse you from service in Bowser's army.\n\nI do want to talk about the implications of this unit for a moment.\n\nSpecifically Dry Bones and Dry Bowser, whose naming conventions confuse and frighten me.\n\nWhen I die, will I become Dry Brian?\n\nIs a living Bowser...\n\nWet Bowser?\n\nWhy do Piranha Plant have bone in it?\n\nNext we have our aquatic troops.\n\nWhere can you find pleasure, search the world for treasure, learn science technology?\n\nUm.\n\nWhere can you begin to make your dreams all come true, on the land or on the sea?\n\n*SINGING* IN THE NAVY!\n\nI won’t overstay my welcome on the naval forces because we already understand what\n\neach of the ranks in the hierarchy entail.\n\nBut I did just want to point out one troop.\n\nThe Gushen.\n\nBecause its name is the Gushen.\n\nAnd I had to learn that its name was the Gushen.\n\nAnd now you need to know that it's called a Gushen as well.\n\nAnd of course, the admiral of the fleet is going to be Unagi.\n\nBecause Unagi is the most terrifying character ever rendered.\n\nGet fucked, Mr. X.\n\nNow on to the Air Force, we start with the Paragoomba at our lowest rank.\n\nAnd honestly, we're gonna skip ahead to wing commander, because most of the Air Force is\n\njust infantry but with wings attached.\n\nLakitu is our wing commander.\n\nYou might remember him as that helpful guy who picks you up in Mario Kart.\n\nBut he actually got his start in carpet bombing.\n\nAnd it might seem redundant to have Klepto as the marshal of the Air Force.\n\nBut if there's one strategy that Bowser's military understands better than anything else,\n\nit's stealing hats.\n\nAnd these are the branches of Bowser’s military.\n\nOf course, there are also Special Forces.\n\nUnits that Bowser can send in when he needs something to be done quietly and cleanly.\n\nLike when the he sent the Broodals to perform the extrajudicial killing of Professor E. Gadd.\n\nNext we've got the Bros.\n\nI'm talking the Hammer Bro, the Fire Bro, every bro in between.\n\nYou can learn more about them in the HBO series, Band of Brothers.\n\nI assume.\n\nI've never watched the show.\n\nIt’s time for the special forces called The Funny Parade!\n\nIt’s the Funny Parade!\n\nYou know about Thwomps, but did you know that there are Thwimps?\n\nAnd the Whomps have Whimps?\n\nThwimps and Thwomps and Whimps and Whomps and Grindels and Spindels and Grrrols.\n\nThere's Tox Box and Flomps and Rhomps and Bomps and Walleyes and Wallops and\n\nthey're all pretty much invincible and they will crush you without hesitation\n\nlike a cartoonish Sherman’s March to the Sea.\n\nNext, we've got the Koopalings.\n\nThey're sort of like the Seal Team 6 of Bowser's army.\n\nIggy, Larry, Lemmy, Roy, Wendy O., Ludwig Von.\n\nNotice that I did not include Morton Koopa Jr., because despite what he has written in\n\nhis memoirs, he's never actually been active duty, and he’s a valor stealing bastard.\n\nAnd the final special forces team.\n\nIt’s the Stus.\n\nStrollin’ Stu (strollin' stu).\n\nSoarin’ Stu (soarin' stu).\n\nSwipin' Stu (swipin' stu).\n\nSmolderin’ Stu (smolderin' stu).\n\n*Pat laughs offscreen.*\n\nI don’t know if they’re good at fighting\n\nbut they are good at being the best fucking characters in Mario.\n\nAnd that is every troop in Bowser’s military.\n\nExcept for these six specific ones.\n\nThey didn't really fit in the military structure.\n\nThey don't act like military.\n\nThe Koopa Troopas from Super Mario 64, they don’t even antagonize you.\n\nLike, they go about their business unless you go out of your way to attack them.\n\nSo, again, they don't even, like, feel like military.\n\nUh, they act more like civilians, to be honest.\n\n*realizing an unfortunate truth*\n\nOh my god, they’re civilians.\n\nOkay, so maybe reading the full Geneva Conventions wasn’t such an unnecessary thing after all.\n\nThere’s this thing called the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, and in\n\nArticle 8 Subsection 2, it states that grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions\n\ncount as war crimes.\n\nAnd if these Koopa Troopas are in fact not Troopas, but civilians, and Mario kills them,\n\nthen that is a direct violation of Article 8 Part 2, subsection B, 1: (i) Intentionally\n\ndirecting attacks at the civilian population...\n\nMario is a war criminal.\n\nBut that’s not the only breach, God no.\n\nSubsection A 4: Extensive destruction and appropriation of property.\n\nDestroying a brick to gain a coin.\n\nSubsection A 5, Compelling a prisoner of war... to serve in the forces of a hostile Power.\n\nWhat else could you call using Cappy to possess enemies\n\nand then forcing them to fire on their own friends?\n\nSubsection A 8, Taking of hostages.\n\nWhat was Mario doing with that penguin child?\n\nYou might think, hey, maybe Mario's just become hardened after years of onslaught\n\nby Bowser, but LOOK BACK TO MARIO’S YOUTH!\n\nI know I didn’t include Yoshi’s Island in these lists of games, but Subsection B, 21:\n\nCommitting outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment.\n\nYoshi made Burt the Bashful’s pants fall down!\n\nBut Baby Mario gave the order.\n\nHe already feels bashful!\n\nYou didn't need to pants the man!\n\nMario has committed at least 5 war crimes,\n\nand I’m not even including the child soldiers he has enlisted in the RPGs.\n\nBut luckily, I’ve already compiled an extensive PDF that I have just emailed to the Hague,\n\noutlining Mario's crimes.\n\nStill, it’s important to note that Bowser is also at fault.\n\nThe great loss of Goomba life is a tragedy, no matter which side you are on.\n\nThe true enemy is war itself.\n\nAnd to fix that, we have to turn to the only thing that’s worked in the past.\n\nSong.\n\nOne more time everyone!\n\nWe are the Toads.\n\nWe are the goombas.\n\nSo please stop jumping on each other, ya big Galoombas!\n\nWhy do we fight to take each others’ space, when there’s so mushroom to spare.\n\nWe could all have extra lives if we just share. ", ' CASTLEVANIA!\n\nOne of my favorite game series of all time.\n\nThe myriad enemies you face in Dracula’s abode are made even better knowing that they\n\ncome from real mythology and folklore.\n\nWouldn’t it be nice if there was one place you could find the FULL BESTIARY of EVERY\n\nMONSTER in Castlevania?\n\nI think that would be nice.\n\nOR AT LEAST I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE.\n\nI swear to god, the first time I started filming this video, I thought it would be an easy\n\nchange of pace.\n\nI mean, how many unique enemies could there really be in Castlevania?\n\n100?\n\n200?\n\nHow about more than 600.\n\nSo I booked 3 hours in this studio to film.\n\nAnd then we ran out of time about halfway through.\n\nSo I went out to grab some lunch, but it start to rain, so I ate a chicken sandwich drenched.\n\nThat has nothing to do with the video, I just wanted you to know my pain.\n\nSo I had to start filming all over again, this time after hours in a random meeting\n\nroom in our office building.\n\nAnd when I finished that, I had three and a half hours of footage that I was able to\n\nwhittle down into an hour long video that was very educational and extremely entertaining.\n\nJUST KIDDING.\n\nIT WAS BORING AS HELL.\n\nBut just when all hope seemed lost, I had an epiphany.\n\n“I am going to throw myself into the sea.”\n\nLuckily, before I could do that, my coworkers stopped me and convinced me that trying to\n\ncategorize all 600 Castlevania monsters was a bad idea, and instead, I could just pick the hot one.\n\nAsk yourself, why are vampires always the hot monster?\n\nIsn’t it someone else’s turn?\n\nI’m here to answer that question now that I’m filming this video for the third time.\n\nBe thankful that I’m not releasing an hour long video of me basically just lecturing\n\nyou on mythology.\n\nI mean, who knows, maybe I’ll release that video some other time.\n\nTHAT WAS A JOKE.\n\nI’M NOT GONNA DO THAT.\n\nYOU’RE GONNA HAVE TO TRUST ME.\n\nIT WAS A REALLY BAD VIDEO.\n\nSO LET’S FIND CASTLEVANIA’S MOST ELIGIBLE BACHELOR!\n\n*hot music*\n\n*lonely squeaking*\n\nLet’s cull down that list of over 600 enemies.\n\nWe’re gonna start by smooshing all of the ones with common mythologies into just one\n\nenemy, so that way we don’t have to deal with the 96 different skeletons.\n\nWe\'re also going to go ahead and cut out the evil human beings, and that includes the Belmonts that\n\nyou fight as enemies, and also all of the vampires.\n\nWe all know that Dracula is hot.\n\nWe all know that Richter Belmont is hot.\n\nI’m also going to go ahead and cut all of the enemies from Boku Dracula Kun, which was\n\njust a spinoff series, and Getsu Fuma Den enemies, which only appeared in one stage\n\nin Castlevania Harmony of Despair.\n\nAnd now it’s time to cut the animals, mythical or otherwise.\n\nLook, if they’re anthropomorphized sure, but for things like “Owl,” that’s not\n\na monster, that’s a bird.\n\nWhat about ephemera like will o’ the wisps, or inanimate objects made animate, kind of\n\nlike golems or marionettes.\n\nI went back and forth on whether or not to include these, and then I realized they creep\n\nme out, so I cut them.\n\nNow I’m going to cut out all of the gods and the god servants and the embodiments of\n\nthings like chaos and evil, because those are inherently unique.\n\nI\'m gonna cull this list a little bit more, because, let’s be honest, vampires aren’t the only monsters\n\nthat have had a taste *kiss* of that sexy limelight.\n\nWitches and warlocks, zombie, orc, treant, werewolf, mermen, gargoyle, gremlin, ghosts,\n\nMedusa, cyclops, yeti, fox archer, ogres, stained glass knight, from Young Sherlock\n\nHolmes, where he appeared as the first photorealistic CGI in any movie back in 1985.\n\nAnd finally, mummies, Brendan Fraser.\n\nWasn’t the mummy in the film, but he’s sexy enough that just by association.\n\nBut we’ve culled it down to the perfect number to figure out our sexy monster.\n\nThat’s right.\n\nWe’ve got 69 left.\n\nCan I get a WOOP?\n\nPatrick: Woo!\n\nClayton: woo.\n\nWe’ll work on it, Clayton.\n\nCriteria for what makes a sexy monster: Number one, is it replicable.\n\nI’ve already explained this, it can’t be a unique monster.\n\nAnything unique can be sexy.\n\nLook at Benedict Cumberbatch.\n\nNumber two, is it datable?\n\nCan you have a conversation with this monster?\n\nCan you bring it to Applebee’s?\n\nAnd number three, can this monster…\n\nGET IT?\n\nWe\'re gonna start with the viable ones that probably aren’t the best sex icons, like Mimic, which\n\nis kind of a veiny blob.\n\nThe Two Headed Creature.\n\nPart cyclops, part werewolf, all bad.\n\nWight, W.I.G.H.T.\n\ncomes from the old English term meaning human being.\n\nIt’s like a… just a blue zombie.\n\nNecromancers…\n\nI don’t know, they’re into weird shit.\n\nSpriggans come from Cornish faery lore, and they are described as old, wizened men with\n\nhuge childlike heads, uh, which someone’s into, I’m sure.\n\nNominon is a beast that, like, sucks the dreams out of your brains.\n\nAnd that’s not a very supportive partner.\n\nPunaguchi is just a large protruding mouth.\n\nI don’t want to know what that mouth do.\n\nThe Maneating Plant, the Wakwak Tree, and the Human Face Tree are all plants.\n\nSo if you would want to make the monster sexy, it would just… it’s just a plant.\n\nThe rug creature.\n\nUh, you never actually see what it is, it’s just always under the rug.\n\nWhich means it’s probably just like a cat.\n\nHearteater.\n\nIf you’re into bad boys.\n\nCastlevania has some of the best design in any pixel art game, except for the Towers Guardian.\n\nI don’t know what the hell this is.\n\nA ghoul isn’t necessarily a zombie, it is something that eats corpses, which is just gross.\n\nThis one’s for the sapiosexuals out there… the Brain Float.\n\nAlastor: you should be wary of anyone who builds their personality around swords.\n\nElementals are just embodiments of fire and frost.\n\nJust hard to cuddle with.\n\nThe Legend of Zeldo.\n\nIt’s just a person with scythes.\n\nThey are also known by the name “the Night Stalker,” which is a big red flag.\n\nThe Kyoma Demon hangs out in mirrors and jumps out and scares you, uh, and I don’t need\n\nanymore reason to be afraid of looking at myself in the mirror.\n\n*pensive music*\n\nMan Beast comes in two forms: twink and twunk.\n\nThey say that eye contact is important.\n\nBut maybe not this much.\n\nI do think we need a sexy skeleton, and the epitome of skeleton in this game is Yorick.\n\nYorick comes from Hamlet, the famous soliloquy “Alas, poor Yorick.”\n\nIn the Japanese version, he isn’t called Yorick, he’s called Soccer Boy.\n\nThe Imp is a mischievous sprite.\n\nAnd I was a bit worried about size differentials, but then I remembered Bee Movie, where a human\n\nwoman falls in love with a bee.\n\nJerry Seinfeld taught me that through love all things are possible.\n\nTrolls.\n\nIt’s time for someone to give them the love they deserve.\n\nThe next monster is Evil Force.\n\nAnd I want you to just go ahead and wipe away all preconceived notions.\n\nObviously, the name makes it sound bad.\n\nUh.\n\nIt also is terrible.\n\n(Pat laughs off camera).\n\nEdimmu are Mesopotamian demons that come back from the dead when they weren’t buried correctly,\n\nwhich seems like super high maintenance.\n\nThe Slaughterer apparently skips leg day.\n\nThe Arthroverta.\n\nJust a human face plastered on top of, like, an arthropod. I dunno, maybe?\n\nChon Chon, or the Bitterfly, comes from Chile.\n\nIt’s about Mapuche wizards that turn into this thing.\n\nKind of like vampires turning into bats.\n\nIt’s a neat talent.\n\n*revealing my true Chon Chon form*\n\nThe Killer Mantle.\n\nComes from an urban legend in Japan about Aka Manto, which is a spirit that lives in\n\ntoilets and then asks you if you want red or blue toilet paper.\n\nRed, they’ll stab you in the back a bunch, and blue, they’ll strangle you till you\n\nturn blue.\n\nI’m just not into toilet stuff.\n\nI mean most of these monsters are pretty okay.\n\nUm, they’re not the… they’re not like the most.\n\nSURPRISE!\n\nI LULLED YOU INTO A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY!\n\nIt’s time for a minigame I like to call, “If I were a Castlevania game... what title\n\nwould I be?”\n\nTake your birth month, and that’s the first part of the title.\n\nOF.\n\nAnd your birth date is the second part.\n\nMy title would be Castlevania: Sonata of the Eclipse.\n\nAll of these games sound the same.\n\nWe’re halfway through the viable enemies.\n\nWe’ve got 35 monsters that I think are pretty good options.\n\nWe’re gonna start with the monsters that are supposed to be sexy, so it feels kind\n\nof unfair to use them as the sexy monsters.\n\nLorelai, Lilith, and all of the succubi, Harpys, Headhunter, Arachnes, Dryads, Rusalka, and Naiads.\n\nI’m just putting these ones all around the sides.\n\nThe demons.\n\nThe ones with the horns and the wings and they’re really ripped and muscular.\n\nMothman.\n\nEveryone thinks the Mothman is pretty sexy.\n\nAlthough this Jersey Devil depiction looks just kind of like a horse with wings, uh,\n\nthe actual Jersey Devil comes from an idea of a woman who cursed her 13th child, being like,\n\n“UGH GOD I GOTTA HAVE ANOTHER BABY.”\n\nAnd then it came out and it grew like a goat’s face and wings, and I just think we need to\n\nstart thinking of New Jersey in general as sexier.\n\nAnd this might be the way to do that.\n\nThe Minotaur.\n\nYou gotta work through that labyrinth, but once you get in there and find the real Minotaur,\n\nhe might kill you.\n\nBut, he also might open up and be really lovely.\n\nThe Chupacabra is an impish little fella.\n\nFirst sighted in Puerto Rico and is known throughout lots of Latin America.\n\nHis name translates to goat sucker.\n\nDo I have to explain why...\n\nThe Fomorians are personifications of chaos and other evil ideas in Irish folklore.\n\nUm, and they\'re these goat people, uh, and they\'re ripped as hell.\n\nLizard Man.\n\nIf you don\'t know why I\'m putting this here.\n\n*COME ON*\n\nYou gotta go what my Skyrim video.\n\nBanshee comes from Irish folklore and will foretell the death of someone you know.\n\nIt\'s a bit spooky.\n\nIt\'s also super emotionally available.\n\nYou won\'t have to worry about what the Banshee is thinking.\n\nThey will tell you when they\'re upset.\n\nAnd also when your parents are gonna die.\n\nSlogra.\n\nDoesn\'t have a folklore or mythology associated with it.\n\nI got nothing for ya.\n\nIf you\'re not attracted to this, you\'re wrong.\n\nBecause the Rycuda only exists in Castlevania, it means that there\'s... very specific artwork\n\nthat you can find of it.\n\nVery modern artwork has been made about the Rycuda, which proves it can be sexy.\n\nDullahan is an Irish faery that is like a headless horseman sort of character, it\'s\n\nalso another portent of death, but can you think about all the cool Spider-Man kisses\n\nyou can do with that?\n\nThe Jiang Shi is the Qing dynasty version of a vampire.\n\nKeremet comes out when you bang on his pot a couple times.\n\nIt\'s a good face, right?\n\nI could talk to that thing for hours.\n\nThere are so many armors in Castlevania.\n\nNo one can turn down a man in uniform.\n\nOr a poltergeist in uniform.\n\nOr literally just an enchanted uniform.\n\nUGHHHHHHH MOTHER OF PEARL I forgot about goblins.\n\nEveryone forgets about goblins though, so I\'ll put \'em over here!\n\nI also forgot about Siren, that\'s another thing that\'s sexy and draws people in.\n\nHow did I skip so many of these?\n\nThe Guillotiner doesn\'t look like much, could be a problem, but it\'s time for us to bring it back.\n\nSlime.\n\nThere are already things online.\n\nThe Tsuchinoko is a Japanese cryptid that is a snake that is fatter in its middle than\n\non its head or its tail.\n\nPat (off camera): I just don\'t see why it\'s sexy.\n\nYou don\'t...\n\nPatrick, you gotta understand.\n\nIt\'s not about what you could first see, right?\n\nPat: I mean, but even after that, what do you see after that?\n\nIt has a propensity for lying and for drinking alcohol.\n\nPatrick thinks it shouldn\'t be this high on the list, but fuck Patrick.\n\nWe\'re at the top five.\n\nBut before we get there, um, I have a confession to make.\n\nI\'ve kept six monsters that don\'t even fit my criteria, but I love them so much that\n\nI think they deserve a chance.\n\nFirst up is a unique character, it\'s Nergal Meslamstea.\n\nThe reason I think he deserves a chance is because is because someone named him Nergal\n\nMeslamstea.\n\nOf course he\'s gonna be fucking evil if you name your child...\n\nWhy, what is up with people in Castlevania naming their children dumb shit?\n\nSeriously, Alucard?\n\nDracula, you can\'t just name your child your name backwards.\n\nI\'m not gonna name my son Nairb.\n\nScary Candle.\n\nIt\'s an inanimate object that is made animate, but I fucking love candles.\n\nNext two I think are pretty self explanatory: Bone Pillar.\n\nAnd if that doesn\'t make you happy, how \'bout the Bone Dragon?\n\nThis next one is a ghost, and I\'ve already explained why that one shouldn\'t be included\n\nin this, but I had to because the ghost\'s name is Duke Mirage.\n\nAnd if someone comes up to me and introduces themself to me as Duke Mirage,\n\nmy pants are already off.\n\nFinally, I know I nixed all animals.\n\nBut I really do think we should include Hyena with gun.\n\nThat hyena can GET IT.\n\nWe\'re at the top five.\n\nThe Malebranche come from Dante\'s Divine Comedy.\n\nThey\'re all unique demons that are used to help keep corrupt politicians under boiling\n\npits of tar in Hell.\n\nThey all have great names like Cagnazzo and Scarmiglione, which was translated into the\n\nEnglish version as Skull Millione, which is just a Soundcloud rapper.\n\nThey\'re already mischievous, and they hate corrupt politicians.\n\nWe can get behind that.\n\nThe Myconid is a sentient race of mushroom people.\n\nWe have anthropomorphized animalia, why not anthropomorphized fungi?\n\nWhen I was a kid, my mom thought that I had a nutritional deficit because I kept wanting\n\nto eat mushrooms so much, like I ate only mushrooms for like a whole week.\n\nThat has nothing to do with this.\n\nI know I took out all of the werewolf creatures, uh, but this one isn\'t that.\n\nThis is the Princess of Moss.\n\nThe human version is based off of\n\nPFBRRRRRRRR UHM OFF WITH THE-ERRR Let them eat cake?\n\n(Pat: Mary Antoinette) Mary Antoinette.\n\nI think we should have more moth creatures in our movies.\n\nRight?\n\nThey\'re already drawn towards the limelight.\n\nIt\'s an Ukoback.\n\nWhy is this the second sexiest monster from Castlevania?\n\nI\'ll tell you why.\n\nHe carries around a hot thing of coals in a spoon, and is also responsible not only\n\nfor fried foods, but fireworks.\n\nHELL YES.\n\nWhat a cool dude!\n\nI think Ukobacks could be real sexy, right?\n\nWhat is more sexy than feeding someone with a lovely fried dish?\n\nAnd finally, the thing that I think should be new sexy monster.\n\nThe Mandrake.\n\nOr the Alura Une.\n\nBasically, any sort of plant person.\n\nAlura Une actually comes from a 1911 book called "Alraune."\n\nIt\'s a German story.\n\nI just think that this kind of gives you a blank slate on something, sure this, this\n\nthing is born from the ground where hanged men bleed, which is spooky, and scary, but\n\nit\'s not their fault!\n\nRight?\n\nYou know, they didn\'t choose to be born.\n\nWho does choose to be born?\n\nRight?\n\nWho chooses...\n\nThe metaphors of how our family raises us, you know, the mandrake is a perfect idea of\n\nsomething that can become greater than its original circumstances.\n\n*SIGH* So there you go.\n\nThe full bestiary of the sexy monsters.\n\nAgain, couldn\'t give you the full full bestiary, because that took me way too long.\n\nAnd if you\'ll excuse me, I\'m going to go throw myself into the ocean now.\n\nI CAN\'T DO THAT.\n\nI KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE COLD BUT I DIDN\'T THINK IT WAS GOING TO BE THAT COLD.\n\nMake sure to like this video and subscribe to Polygon if you want to see more Unraveled,\n\nand go ahead and leave a comment of your new Castlevania title.\n\nMaybe that\'ll convince them to make a new game. ', ' Welcome to Unraveled Season 2!\n\nYou can tell it’s a new season because I’ve grown a mustache and cut my hair.\n\nOhoho I’m obviously just kidding.\n\nThese are both fake.\n\nI know how much it would disappoint my friends if I changed my appearance.\n\nI\'m just kidding again.\n\nI\'m not your friend, and you have no say over what I do with my body.\n\nAnd speaking of harsh realities...\n\nThe world of Dark Souls is frightening and murky.\n\nHow can you truly understand Dark Souls lore without living Dark Souls?\n\nGrinding away tirelessly in inhospitable environments, under uncharitable overlords.\n\nTo truly understand Dark Souls lore, you must first understand the desolation of…\n\nWorking at a job!\n\nHave you ever thought about the term Boss in a video game before?\n\nThose terrible enemies have the same title as the people you’ll be working for\n\nfor the rest of your life!\n\nHaha, what a silly coincidence!\n\nDark Souls is known for wildly difficult bosses that prove themselves on the battlefield,\n\nbut can they prove themselves in a more difficult setting:\n\nthe Lordran Hills Business Park and Commerce Center!\n\nIt’s across from the mall.\n\nToday, I’m ranking every Dark Souls boss based on how good they’d be as a manager.\n\nI\'m not dancing this season.\n\nWelcome to the Dark Souls Corp. onboarding seminar.\n\nNow I\'m only going to be speaking about the Dark Souls 1, 2, and 3 bosses.\n\nNo other “Soulsborne” games.\n\nI was originally thinking about putting in the Demon\'s Souls, but they actually got integrated\n\ninto the Dark Corporation in a very messy merger.\n\nAll of the managers got sacked.\n\nSo we\'re not talking about them.\n\nThat leaves us with 96 Dark Souls bosses and minibosses.\n\nAnd it leads us to the difficult part of our journey, how do we objectively answer the\n\nsubjective question: “What makes a good boss?”\n\nSo I started researching lists of “the x qualities of a good boss” on places like\n\nLinkedIn and Forbes, and then I fell down the rabbit hole of the hundreds of corporate blogs.\n\nAnd at the end of this journey, I realized... it didn\'t matter at all.\n\nWhat does matter is making a catchy, powerpointable mnemonic device.\n\nSo here are the Five Cs that make a good boss:\n\nNumber one, clear vision.\n\nCan this boss communicate their goals, give clear steps on how to achieve those goals.\n\nDoes this boss clearly hold their big old arm way up in the air before slamming it down on you?\n\nNumber two, consistent feedback.\n\nIt’s important for a boss to let you know that you’ve made a mistake, like challenging\n\nSeath the Scaleless before putting on your ring of sacrifice, you absolute fool.\n\nYou child.\n\nNumber three, cherishes employees.\n\nA good boss values employee perspectives and rewards good performance.\n\nLike when a boss decides to die when you hit it in a good way.\n\nNumber four, compassionate leadership.\n\nHonest. Trusting.\n\nWorthy of respect from their employees.\n\nThe kind of boss you could chat with at the Estus cooler.\n\nAnd the fifth and final C. Can really just go to town on a motherfucker.\n\nSlices.\n\nDices.\n\nBig old crunchers.\n\nSomeone who’s willing to do what needs to be done when the going gets tough.\n\nOr someone who reveals an abyssal dragon that they’ve been keeping under their armor this whole time.\n\nThis is our main criteria for what makes a good boss.\n\nBut for 96 bosses, it\'s gonna be hard to differentiate their management style with just these five Cs.\n\nWhich is why I’m introducing the HR index.\n\nIf they\'re over here, they get a lot of HR compliments.\n\nIf they\'re down here, they get a lot of HR complaints.\n\nLet’s be honest, some really well-loved bosses are very bad leaders, and some really good leaders\n\nare SKEEZY AS HELL.\n\nSo let\'s rank some DARK SOULS BOOOOOSSEEEEEEEEES.\n\nHere\'s our scale.\n\nWe\'re gonna start out with the neutrals.\n\nThey\'re the standard boss, so I\'m just gonna skim through them.\n\nGuardian Dragon, The Pursuer, Old Demon King, Demon of Song.\n\nIf you\'re watching this video and you see yourself exhibiting these lackluster tendencies,\n\nI want you to ask yourself: What can I do to be better than the Royal Rat Authority,\n\nwho vomits acid all over the floor multiple times a day and is still considered a pretty\n\nokay boss.\n\nAim higher.\n\nLet\'s talk about the pushovers!\n\nNow, these are like my favorite substitute teacher in high school, Mr. S,\n\nwho would go off on class-long tangents about his youth traveling the world\n\ninstead of teaching us about Lord of the Flies.\n\nI loved Mr. S.\n\nObjectively a terrible teacher, though.\n\nChampion\'s Gravetender and Gravetender Greatwolf.\n\nThis guy’s so fun!\n\nHe brought his dog into work!\n\nI love dogs!\n\nLiterally nothing\'s going to get done today.\n\nVordt of the Boreal Valley.\n\nHe runs around on all fours.\n\nHe\'s really disrupting the “walking” space.\n\nIt’s very ineffective.\n\nIron Golem.\n\nHe’s sweet, sort of bumbling, and you’ve asked him to approve your expense reports\n\nlike five times already.\n\nAava, Lud, and Zallen, the King\'s Pets.\n\nLiterally baked into the title, they\'re teacher\'s pets.\n\nThey suck up to the king.\n\nSeath the Scaleless is a real sweetheart, but he is very risk averse.\n\nAnd if you destroy his crystal, he becomes mortal, and takes it, like, really personally.\n\nThe Fume Knight.\n\nHe’s got two sides, two swords.\n\nLook, he\'s still got his old sword back when he had your job.\n\nBut eventually he is gonna get rid of that sword.\n\nHe\'s gonna be a real asshole about it.\n\nThe Lost Sinner.\n\nShe, and I quote, “eternally punishes herself for the sins of her past.”\n\nIt’s important to have a boss that recognizes their flaws, but it\'s bad if your boss locks\n\nherself in the conference room and flogs herself eternally.\n\nI booked the conference room for three, I need to get in there.\n\nCrossbreed Priscilla goes invisible at the first sign of conflict.\n\nThat\'s not showing up for the company.\n\nLorian and Lothric the princes.\n\nOne of them hangs around the other one\'s neck of the other one, who\'s actually doing all the work.\n\nWhich is the worst form of micromanaging.\n\nThe Four Kings.\n\nYou don\'t fight all four at once.\n\nYou fight one and then the rest come in slowly.\n\nWhich is kind of like every group project you had in high school.\n\nThe Carthus Sand Worm.\n\nIf you ignore them, they\'ll ignore you, and some people like that managing style.\n\nBut also if you stand on the sideline for long enough, someone else will shoot big arrows\n\ninto them and then they\'ll die.\n\nAnd that\'s a bad boss.\n\nThe Dragonslayer Armour is actually just a puppet for these big wiry dragon butterfly things.\n\nSo they\'re well-loved by the higher ups, but only because they don\'t have any ideas on their own.\n\nThe Ancient Wyvern is the epitome of pushover.\n\nBecause you can just run through his stage and then kill him with one attack at the very end.\n\nThis is perfect for the employee that likes to, you know, fuck around on Reddit all day\n\nand then send one email at five and then peace out.\n\nI don\'t know what that\'s like.\n\nI\'ve never done that.\n\nAnd finally, this is sort of a technical pushover.\n\nIt\'s the Ruin Sentinels.\n\nThey\'re kind of like a board of directors in that they all look the same and do the\n\nsame thing, which is to say not a lot.\n\nBut you gotta suck up to them if you want to get anywhere in the company.\n\nNow we\'re gonna flip to the opposite side of the scale.\n\nWe\'re gonna talk about the sketchies.\n\nThese have a powerful understanding of corporate leadership...\n\nbut everyone hates them.\n\nThe Boreal Outrider Knight is a miniboss, but like, you can tell he really wants to be a boss.\n\nNashandra tricks you into opening the Throne of Want even though she just wants it for herself.\n\nBut manipulation gets you pretty far in business.\n\nThe Burnt Ivory King only comes to fight you after you kill literally all of his knights.\n\nHe gets it done, sure, but only when he needs to.\n\nDragonrider.\n\nThis dude doesn\'t have a dragon.\n\nHis job title is obviously false.\n\nIt\'s like if I got promoted to "Guy who had an okay time in high school."\n\nBed of Chaos.\n\nActually a very effective leader, but every time you have to have\n\na "Meeting with the Bed of Chaos,"\n\nsomeone in HR gets an email.\n\nCentipede Demon.\n\nHe nasty.\n\nManus, the Father of the Abyss.\n\nAlways screaming at me.\n\nBad anger management.\n\nHigh Lord Wolnir has a lot of gold jewelry.\n\nVery ostentatious.\n\nAll of his plans sound more like schemes,\n\nBUT!\n\nHe does know the bassist for Maroon 5 and they\'ve been looking for someone with like\n\nreally good hand dexterity and he\'s noticed that you\'ve got something good so if you want...\n\nMytha, the Baneful Queen doesn\'t really have an understanding of personal boundaries.\n\nShe\'s kind of like that coworker who, instead of sending an email,\n\njust peeks their head over the cubicle wall.\n\nExcept in this case that head is severed from the body and will explode.\n\nPinwheel can summon an unlimited amount of clones.\n\nMost bosses wish they could be everywhere at once.\n\nThis one can be.\n\nSlave Knight Gael came into the company with you, was a really good friend, and then he\n\ngot promoted over you, and he\'s been a real jerk since.\n\nAldia, Scholar of the First Sin is constantly testing you, because he sees great things in you.\n\nBut dude, not everything has to be a test.\n\nThis is a Game Stop.\n\nAldrich, Devourer of Gods has a bunch of skeletons strewn about his clothes, and those are the\n\npeople he ate on his way to the top.\n\nWhich is incredibly cutthroat, but at least he’s honest about it.\n\nPontiff Sulyvahn has two swords: a profane flame and a sword of judgment.\n\nAnd he hits you with both of them.\n\nHe\'s the type of guy who sends you an NSFW link at work\n\nand then reports you for clicking on it.\n\nDragon Slayer Ornstein and Executioner Smough get shit DONE.\n\nThey are a power couple...\n\nthat isn\'t sanctioned by HR.\n\nThey didn\'t fill out the paperwork.\n\nIt makes everyone very uncomfortable.\n\nThere is a LOT of PDA.\n\nAnd it is weird.\n\nNow let\'s move on to the good category, with the Old Dragonsl...\n\nTHIS IS JUST ORNSTEIN AGAIN.\n\nTHIS DUDE JUST PUT ON A DIFFERENT SUIT AND TRIED TO GET REHIRED IN THE OGDEN BRANCH.\n\nThat\'s not gonna fly!\n\nY’all ready for the stinkers?\n\nYou thought we had some pretty bad bosses up to this point, but we haven\'t even hit\n\nthe depths of bad bossery.\n\nWe\'re about to hit the Blighttown of HR.\n\nVendrick.\n\nDude, you gotta wear more than a loincloth to work.\n\nChaos Witch Quelaag and Scorpioness Najka are nude from the waist up...\n\nand nude from the waist down.\n\nY\'all, we have leftover shirts from the softball game, can you just go into the bathroom and\n\nput one of those on, please?\n\nOld Iron King is constantly working from home and he signs all of his emails,\n\n"Sent from my hot tub."\n\nGET OUT OF THE HOT TUB!\n\nCeaseless Discharge.\n\nThe name alone tells me you should have taken a sick day.\n\nOceiros, the Consumed King is always going on about his son Ocelotte,\n\nshowing you pictures of him and his rowing team.\n\nYou KNOW that this psych major is gonna replace you as soon as he graduates Yale.\n\nAsylum Demon, Stray Demon, Demon Firesage all have a move called butt slam.\n\n*camera nods in agreement*\n\nLooking Glass Knight.\n\nReflects everyone\'s flaws back on them, doesn\'t look inward enough.\n\nCurse-rotted Greatwood.\n\nAnother dress code violation.\n\nGwyn, Lord of Cinder is kept around because he was the founder and made a lot of money\n\non Wall Street in the \'80s, but he’s hollow inside.\n\nThe Covetous Demon is always taking credit for the work that you\'re doing.\n\nAnd he steals your lunch from the fridge every day, even though I label it, DAVE.\n\nAbyss Watchers.\n\nInfighting is a very dangerous thing for a group of managers.\n\nThe Crystal Sage does a little bit of work, and then vanishes, and then does a little bit more work,\n\nand then vanishes, and then you see them on their instagram story at some beer garden.\n\nSister Friede is actually a very good boss, and should be up here, but unfortunately\n\nshe\'s the assistant to Father Ariandel\n\nwho is SO incompetent he can\'t untie a chair from his ass.\n\nAnd finally, the worst boss...\n\nThe Gaping Dragon.\n\nUnder no circumstances should you be in a work setting\n\nand described as gaping.\n\nAll that\'s left is the top right of this scale, the good bosses, but before we get there,\n\nthere are a few bosses that don\'t really fit into the standard "boss/employee" structure,\n\nor they\'re basically corporations in their own right, so we\'ll talk about them as alternatives.\n\nThe Bell and the Belfry Gargoyles only come in when someone else is hurting.\n\nSo they\'re kind of like consultants.\n\nHalflight, Spear of the Church could actually be a real-life human player.\n\nAnd pitting employees against each other is a big no-no.\n\nThe Royal Rat Vanguard is one boss rat that\'s surrounded by a horde of indistinguishable other rats,\n\nso it\'s just an episode of Undercover Boss.\n\nAfflicted Graverobber, Ancient Soldier Varg, and Cerah the Old Explorer are a trio that...\n\nlike, they\'re just high school friends that decided to get together and open a burger joint,\n\nand they\'re kind of incompetent but you love them anyway.\n\nThe Prowling Magus and Congregation is a startup because it\'s one charismatic weirdo who takes\n\ncredit for all of the hardworking people around them.\n\nWe\'ve got some unions!\n\nA good union would be the Skeleton Lords.\n\nIt\'s three lords and a bunch of minions who are recognized and working together toward\n\nthe same goal.\n\nThat\'s a good thing.\n\nA worse union is the Deacons of the Deep, where the management only comes in\n\nafter five of their employees are killed.\n\nFinally, we have the Executioner\'s Chariot, whose employees are trying to unionize,\n\nbut they keep getting trampled.\n\nAnd that leaves us with the good ones.\n\nThere are only 13 of them.\n\nThe Flexile Sentry.\n\nGreat multitasker.\n\nThe Taurus Demon gives you the tools you need to succeed, and encourages you to climb that ladder,\n\nso that way you can jump down and hit him on the head.\n\nGravelord Nito has a lot of skeleton friends.\n\nA very good delegator.\n\nThe Duke\'s Dear Freja.\n\nYeah, she\'s a big spider...\n\nbut she\'s the Duke\'s DEAR Freja!\n\nThe Duke loves her!\n\nWhen has the Duke led you astray before?\n\nCome on, man!\n\nThe Duke loves her!\n\nGive her a chance!\n\nPat (offscreen): Do it for the Duke!\n\nDo it for the Duke!\n\nSinh, the Slumbering Dragon and the Last Giant are slow, deliberate, and they keep on going\n\neven though they got a big fucking spear through \'em.\n\nElana, the Squalid Queen summons friends when things get a bit too much for her.\n\nThat’s good delegation and understanding your limits.\n\nThe Ancient Dragon doesn\'t actually fight you until you fight them, you can just have\n\na chat with this boss, and honestly, that\'s good enough sometimes.\n\nGreat Grey Wolf Sif is a big wolf with a sword.\n\nFUCK YEAH!\n\nThe Nameless King and the King of the Storm.\n\nNow, when the King of the Storm takes enough damage,\n\nthe Nameless King will put them out of their misery.\n\nAnd it\'s very sad, but it\'s also what needed to be happen.\n\nThat\'s good management.\n\nI fully expect my boss, Tara Long, to put me out of my misery when I stop being useful.\n\nThe Soul of Cinder.\n\nIf you kill him, you might become him.\n\nAnd that\'s a very clear path to promotion.\n\nIt’s not a great path to promotion, but it is a clear one.\n\nThe Throne Watcher and Defender are another power couple, but they filled out the HR paperwork.\n\nAnd they work great together!\n\nThey\'re super professional about it.\n\nThey constantly revive the other one when they die, and that\'s a good boss.\n\nAlso, relationship goals.\n\nAnd finally, the best business boss in Dark Souls...\n\nis The Rotten.\n\nBecause this company is employee owned.\n\nEvery movement is made by the collective.\n\nEveryone gets a say.\n\nNow you might think you are small, and insignificant,\n\nand also dead.\n\nBut!\n\nWhen you smash together everyone’s stinky, rotting corpse, you can move mountains together.\n\nThe best boss is you.\n\nAnd all of your dead friends.\n\nAnd in the Dark Souls Corporation, that means you need a job description.\n\nSo go ahead and use this handy chart to figure out your Dark Souls boss title.\n\nAnd that concludes our onboarding seminar.\n\nMake sure to print out your completion certificate at the end of this video\n\nso you can send it to your manager.\n\nHappy managing, and praise the sun!\n\nUnder no circumstances should you be in a work setting and described as gaping.\n\nPat (offscreen): Hey, yo, can I gape in here?\n\nBrian (offscreen, laughing): You guys mind if I gape?\n\nAnd that concludes our onboarding seminar.\n\nMake sure to celebroderadfjoisfjid.\n\n(Pat cracking up offscreen). ', ' E3.\n\nThe Electronic Entertainment Expo.\n\nWhat began as a humble video game industry trade show has blossomed into something more\n\nspectacular.\n\nMore flamboyant.\n\nMore… of whatever this is.\n\nE3 is a chance to show off new games and the theatrical chops of your executives.\n\nBecause that’s what E3 really is now.\n\nIt’s theater.\n\nIt’s like Cats the musical but with more guns and a better plot line.\n\nBut this E3 is different.\n\nA lot of companies are ditching the press conference altogether, and those companies\n\nare cowards.\n\nSony isn’t even showing up to E3 this year!\n\nAnd it’s not because they lack things to say.\n\nIt’s because they have forgotten how to say it.\n\nThe industry has lost its way.\n\nThat’s why I’ll be giving them the 10 keys to creating a perfect E3 presentation,\n\nand then I’ll be giving you the perfect E3 presentation.\n\nIt’s theatre, baby!\n\nThe first step is throwing away everything you know about public speaking, because E3\n\npresentations are a beast of their own.\n\nYou have to watch them to learn from them.\n\nYou might ask, "Brian, wouldn’t learning from old E3s keep you in the rut of old thinking,\n\nmaking the same mistakes that past business geniuses have made?"\n\nNo.\n\nAnd that brings us to the board.\n\nI have watched hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours of E3\n\npresentations and I have analyzed what makes them compelling.\n\nI’ve distilled the essence of E3 down into 10 simple keys.\n\nIf you include these 10 keys, you will create the perfect E3 presentation.\n\nAnd if you, like most people, aren’t putting on an E3 press conference, then you could\n\npotentially use these 10 keys for like a drinking game or something, I’m not saying you should\n\ndo that, I’m saying it’s y… it’s possible.\n\nYou could do that if you wanted t… it’s not…\n\nI did that, okay?\n\nYou can use these for the drinking game.\n\nThe first key: A weirdly high-budget opener.\n\nIt is essential to start the presentation with high energy, and it’s essential to\n\ndo it in such a way as to make the audience say,\n\n“Hmm yeah wow they really paid for that, huh?”\n\nSony used to be great at this, starting 2016’s E3 with an entire orchestra playing the God\n\nof War theme, and then last year they started E3 with an entire banjo player.\n\nWeird thing to spend money on.\n\nBut both of these intros still get BONUS POINTS, because they started with a live musical number.\n\nThe second key is for the presenter.\n\nThey have the unenviable task of connecting with a notoriously difficult audience.\n\nHow can they reach the fickle gamer while still maintaining business poise?\n\nBusiness Gamer Fashion.\n\nBusiness Gamer Fashion is an outfit that is professional, and yet still conveys the idea\n\nthat this person could be seen sitting on a couch for 14 hours at a time.\n\nIt says, “I’m one of you…\n\nbut I’m also way richer than you.”\n\nBut the BONUS POINTS go to the one true business gamer fashion:\n\nill-fitting blazer,\n\ndiesel jeans,\n\ngamer t-shirt.\n\nThe third key is set dressing.\n\nThis has to be theatrical, which is to say, inappropriate for a trade show.\n\nTake a look at Sony’s weird barn church.\n\nIt was like an immersive theatrical experience, but with the 10-minute scene transitions of\n\na high school production of Les Mis.\n\nBut the BONUS POINTS go to live, human set pieces, like, I don\'t know, hanging bodies\n\nfrom the ceiling that FLAIL AROUND when a character moves through them on the screen.\n\nThere’s that classic Sony magic!\n\nI want to remind people that E3 is a trade show.\n\nAnd this is kind of like if Disney held a press conference about the Avengers and then\n\nDISINTEGRATED A MAN LIVE ON STAGE.\n\nNow we’re moving into the meat and potatoes of the presentation with key number four:\n\nNumbers.\n\nVideo Games are just programs and programs are just numbers and for some reason, gamers\n\nlove it when numbers are big.\n\nA few good numbers to say are polygon count, amount of enemies on screen, RAM?\n\nMaybe?\n\nI don\'t know, who gives a shit!?\n\nHonestly, BONUS POINTS go to saying a number that\'s completely devoid of context.\n\nBecause numbers mean…\n\nINNOVATION.\n\nKey number 5.\n\nMore specifically... less specifically.\n\nI need this to be the vaguest discussion ever.\n\nI need you to make claims about how you’re doing something that’s never been done before\n\nand then not tell us what you\'re doing.\n\nHere’s a list of innovative words and phrases.\n\nIt’s the presenter’s job to say each and every one of these.\n\nBut the BONUS POINTS go to the purest form of expressing innovation.\n\nLooking up at the screen behind you, looking back at the audience, and saying…\n\n“Wow.”\n\nKey number six is the game trailer montage.\n\nYou’ve probably never heard of these games before.\n\nYou might never hear of them again, but the BONUS POINTS go to the game trailer montage\n\nthat comes at the end of the presentation, which is just showing you everything you\'ve\n\nseen so far set to an Arcade Fire soundalike.\n\nThese six keys are the foundation of a solid E3 presentation.\n\nYou hit these six, you’re in the clear.\n\nBut you haven’t achieved perfection yet.\n\nBut before we get into the final four, let’s talk about the notable absences.\n\nThese are anti-keys, things you’ll never see in an E3 presentation.\n\nI got a list of them here…\n\nOh what’s this, it’s just a single entry that says “A legitimate discussion about\n\nhow to address the crunch crisis that\'s prevalent in nearly every game studio.”\n\nWell I guess we don\'t need these anymore!\n\n*wild laughter*\n\n*frightening laughter*\n\n*pained laughter*\n\n*pain*\n\nAnd now, it\'s time for the final four keys.\n\nThese are the Truly Special Moments.\n\nThey’re hard to build in, but they turn a good presentation into a transcendent one.\n\nKey number seven: A “WHYW” game.\n\nThis is an acronym that stands for “What? Hell yeah! What!?”\n\nand it\'s used for a game that makes you go,\n\n“What?\n\nHell Yeah!\n\nWHAT!?”\n\nOften these are for games that are totally independent, but the best ones are for weird\n\nentries into beloved franchise, like the Final Fantasy XV VR Fishing Game.\n\nEven now, when someone tells me there’s a Final Fantasy XV VR Fishing Game, I go What? HELL YEAH! WHAT!?\n\nBut the BONUS POINTS... you know what, actually, no.\n\nYou only get bonus points if you make a VR fishing game for a beloved franchise.\n\nI want to watch the Doomslayer catch a bass.\n\nBut sometimes, the presenter has a WHYW moment.\n\nThat’s why key eight is heartfelt emotion.\n\nGenuine excitement about a game, joy, sadness.\n\nThis has to happen naturally.\n\nHonestly, if I’m having a rough day, I will go back and watch the video of Ubisoft developer\n\nDavide Soliani crying after Shigeru Miyamoto compliments him onstage, because that is the\n\nrealest and most joyful moment.\n\nHonestly, who wouldn’t burst out crying if Shigeru Miyamoto, the architect of many\n\nof our childhoods, complimented them?\n\nYou know, that, that tiny thing... that reminder that these people behind the games are human\n\nbeings and can be emotionally moved by the same experience that they get to share with you.\n\nWhat could be better than that?\n\nIf they farted.\n\nThat\'s why key number nine is gaffes!\n\nGaffes are INTEGRAL to E3, so much so that they\'re split into three different categories.\n\nThe first is technical.\n\nGameplay going awry.\n\nCameras cutting back too early.\n\nMics not getting shut off.\n\nThe second category is human.\n\nAwkward pauses, stiff actors, weird phrasing.\n\nThese stick in your brain forever.\n\nHonestly, it feels like they’re planned in order to be meme-able and rememberoareble.\n\nMem- and memorable.\n\nMemorable.\n\nGod, I can’t speak today…\n\nOR CAN I?\n\nTHE THIRD CATEGORY IS PLANNED GAFFES.\n\nI’m about to blow this whole thing wide open.\n\nEveryone can quote at least one E3 gaffe.\n\nEven people who don’t know who Reggie Fils Aime is have probably said “my body is ready”\n\nat least once in their life.\n\nAnd you want to know what that is?\n\nGUERRILLA MARKETING.\n\nThe only reason there are so many gaffes in E3 presentations is to MAKE YOU SHARE THE GAFFES.\n\nYOU MIGHT NOT REMEMBER THE GOOD PRESENTATIONS, BUT YOU SURE AS HELL LAUGHED AT THE MESSY ONES.\n\nTHE GAFFES ARE AN INSIDE JOB TO MAKE YOU BUY MORE VIDEO GAMES.\n\nSo honestly, I’m just gonna assume that all of these are planned from here on out\n\nin order to make you talk about them online.\n\nExcept for when Todd Howard says something that\'s weirdly horny.\n\nTodd: "You\'ll never know when you\'ll need a free hand."\n\nThat’s just Todd.\n\nBONUS POINTS for horny Todd.\n\nAnd the final key: The Big Finish.\n\nThis is a game announcement that falls purely into the fanservice bucket.\n\nIt is unimaginably amazing, incomprehensibly great, unbelievably too good to be true and\n\nhonestly, it\'s because it probably is too good to be true.\n\nThe presenter is gonna say “And one more thing,” and then they\'re gonna show a trailer\n\nthat’s probably a landscape shot, maybe some voiceover, and then just a title screen.\n\nBONUS POINTS if it literally is just a title screen.\n\nAnd then that game is probably gonna get stuck in development hell for 7 years and maybe\n\nnot get released ever.\n\nBut isn’t that what we want, as gamers?\n\nTo be disappointed?\n\nAnd those are the 10 keys to a perfect E3 presentation.\n\nFollow these and you can do no wrong.\n\nAnd if you aren’t doing an E3 presentation, again, you could potentially use them as a\n\ndrinking game.\n\nIt\'s not like I wrote up all the rules already and you can click and you can play \'em along\n\nwith us since we\'re gonna watch all the E3 presentations.\n\nAnd to prove the power of these keys, here’s my perfect E3 presentation.\n\nSony, go ahead and just plug your trailers into the placeholders I set up for you.\n\nWhat does a gamer want?\n\n(what does a gamer want, tell me what does a gamer want)\n\nWhat does a gamer need?\n\n(what does a gamer need, tell me what does a gamer need)\n\nThe games we make are powerful,\n\nnever been done before.\n\nSo let your inner gamer out, we’ll open up the door!\n\nI know you’ll love these games, because I love these games, too.\n\nAnd it feels the best when there’s an excited gamer inside you.\n\nHunter, Hunter, let me get off of the skate...\n\nJesus.\n\nHunter, get it!\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to Unraveled Games’ E3 press conference.\n\nAs a gamer myself, you can tell by the shirt, I’m so excited to share these fresh gaming\n\ninnovations with you all today.\n\nBut before we get to the fun part, let\'s talk some business.\n\nLet me put on my blazer.\n\nLet’s talk about how we’re changing the game… of games.\n\nThe new Unraveled Engine has allowed us to create experiences that are more detailed\n\nthan ever before.\n\nI\'m talking about 1,200 enemies onscreen concurrently, over 49 meganpixels of screen dissolution,\n\n62 giganbotes of RAM,\n\nand SEVEN HUNDRED and TWENTY THOUSAND…\n\nI know it sounds like science fiction, but it’s science fact.\n\nWhy don’t we highlight a few of the games that are coming out on the Unraveled Engine.\n\nWe can go to the next slide.\n\nJen?\n\nJen, we can go to the next.\n\nNext Gen!\n\nFirst up, Unraveled Research 2.\n\nFans loved the experience of creating spreadsheets about video game lore, but in this immersive\n\nsequel, you can do that with a mustache.\n\nWow.\n\nAnd that’s not all.\n\nWe have Explaining Your Job to your Relatives Simulator, the Dark Souls of simulation games.\n\nExperience the terror firsthand of trying to explain to your uncle that you work in\n\na very niche, unstable industry, but with graphics so lifelike you’ll feel like you’re\n\nliving in the world of the game.\n\nNo, Uncle Bob, I don’t make the video games, I just make videos about them.\n\nNo, they aren’t the trailers.\n\nTerrifying.\n\nAnd finally, something groundbreaking, something that seems impossible, but we did it.\n\nI hope you come along with us on this journey of...\n\nBDG Goes Fishing for the First Time\n\nin VR.\n\n*What?\n\nHell yeah!\n\nWhat!?*\n\n*Audience cheering*\n\nI\'ve got the rest of the press conference to get through, you\n\ncan quiet down, please.\n\nBut is that all we’ve got for you?\n\nNot in the slightest.\n\nNow it\'s time to show you some stuff from the company that didn\'t do the presentation,\n\nand let us do all the hard work for them.\n\nHit it.\n\n*Arcade Fire soundalike plays*\n\nWow.\n\nYou know, I, um, I\'m gonna go off script a little bit.\n\nI, uh, it just, I\'ve...\n\nIt means so much to me to be up here on this stage in front of you.\n\nIt\'s been a dream since I was a kid to be presenting something at E3, and to have you\n\nhere in the audience... to, to feel the support that you\'ve given Unraveled Games, is...\n\nHonestly, it\'s, um...\n\nI never in a million years thought that I could have-\n\nOH JESUS, HUNTER, DON\'T TRY TO...\n\nGod damnit.\n\nOkay that’s it, uh, thank you all for coming.\n\nExcept we\'ve got one more thing thing for you.\n\nWe’ve been working on something very special with some very special people.\n\nFrom the visionary minds of David Cage and Peter Molyneux, we have teamed up with publisher\n\nKonami to release an exclusive on Soulja Boy’s gaming console… you know what, I won’t\n\nbore you with the business details, I’ll just let you see the trailer.\n\nVoice over: Yeah.\n\nI think it’s time.\n\n*intense music plays*\n\n*applause*\n\nThank you all so much for coming!\n\nThank you.\n\nHave a great E3!\n\nHunter, get it!\n\n*CRASH* Ha, we\'re good.\n\nThat\'s the take though.\n\n*everyone laughing* Almost, almost broke a laptop.\n\nBut that\'s fine.\n\nWe\'re good.\n\nClayton (offscreen): Set a couple fires, it\'s okay!\n\nBrian: We, we, this is the most intense...\n\nPat: We\'re not allowed to do this show anymore. ', ' *hydraulic machine noises*\n\nFallout.\n\nThis scrappy, billion-dollar franchise takes a fun, kooky\n\nlook at planet-wide armageddon.\n\nIt\'s an alternate history, splitting off from our timeline somewhere\n\naround World War II.\n\nDespite the divergence, Fallout features some familiar real world\n\nculture and plenty of cultural innovation. There are new architectural styles that are\n\nstolen from Mad Max. And plenty of cool new fashion\n\nthat is also just ripped off from Mad Max.\n\nAnd yet, even with this cultural innovation, Fallout has one massive problem.\n\nAnd there\'s only one problem with the Fallout series right now.\n\nOther than that, the Fallout series is doing just fine.\n\nD-despite this one. It\'s just the one of them.\n\nWhy, Todd,\n\nis the music still this?\n\n*audio from three Fallout songs played simultaneously*\n\nThe same dozen songs from before the apocalypse.\n\nYou\'re telling me that humans figured out how to\n\nmake a gun that turns you into goo, and yet they haven\'t made any new music?\n\nThat’s garbage, Todd.\n\nFallout is a meditation on mutation and the ways that humanity and culture\n\nevolve to meet new challenges,\n\nand having music that stays the same the whole time is a plot hole.\n\nWar never changes. But music should.\n\nAnd today, I’m going to change it.\n\n*tech montage music playing*\n\nOoh! This is a new dance move for me.\n\nI don\'t know if I like it yet.\n\nNow, you may think that Fallout’s music is fine. It fits the aesthetic, and\n\nit adds a sense of retrofuturism.\n\nBut you’re wrong, and here’s why.\n\nThe Fallout games range in time from 2102, the year of Fallout 76, to 2287, the year of Fallout 4.\n\nThat’s a span of 185 years. Imagine for a second that our musical sensibilities hadn’t been\n\nupdated in nearly two hundred years, and the current song topping the Billboard charts\n\nwas The Alphabet Song, a song literally written about 185 years ago.\n\nActually, that kind of sounds possible. Modern times are weird.\n\nWhat I’m saying is that if 80% of humans died today, in 100 years,\n\nwe\'d still have Old Town Road, but it would have a few more remixes.\n\nDo you really think that if the world ended in 1997, our culture would linger over\n\n"Barbie Girl" and "Tubthumping"? That we would be complacent with the cultural detritus of euro-techno,\n\nmanufactured pop, and third-wave ska?\n\nNO!\n\nAnd yet it seems the people of Fallout have\n\nforgotten how to make music.\n\nFallout 76 is littered with instruments and bandstands and stages,\n\nbut by the time you get to Fallout 3, the only instrument left is a Stradivarius\n\nviolin locked in a vault surrounded by mirelurks.\n\nFallout 76 also has the highest track count,\n\nnearly twice as many as all of the other games, which implies that these tracks are being\n\nlost over time, and nothing is there to replace it.\n\nOnly two people in the entire 185-year-span\n\nof these games are making new songs. The first is a synth that makes the same bluesy style\n\nas the rest of the music.\n\nIt’s good but it’s not different.\n\nThe other is a burnout DJ who does not seem to know how to sing or play an instrument.\n\nAnd yet he still insists on playing a guitar,\n\nwhich goes to prove that even in the apocalypse, you can’t escape\n\nthe guy who will bring his guitar to your party.\n\nThank god the bombs went off before "Wonderwall."\n\nPeople need food to eat, sure, and, you know, clothes to cover their sinful\n\nbods so that makes sense that those areas have continued to flourish. But Fallout is\n\na world where people have ignored the basic human endeavor of making art.\n\nI won’t stand for that!\n\nWe need art because of its fundamental importance to human expression.\n\nSongs were made long before written language to help keep stories alive, and they\'d be added to\n\nand embellished, much like the cultural touchstone of our time,\n\nTVTropes.org.\n\nScience may improve our health and longevity, but art is what makes long life worth living.\n\nAnd that’s why I am here — to scientifically improve on this art,\n\nand synthesize a totally new genre of music that we should be hearing in the Fallout universe.\n\nThis genre should be inspired by the music landscape and culture of Fallout\'s world.\n\nAny cultural step that goes One Step Beyond current accepted standards\n\nrisks alienating its audience by being too challenging,\n\ntoo intelligent.\n\nSo let’s guide our creation by considering the 10 definitive purposes of music\n\nand how they fit into the beautiful wasteland of Todd’s mindscape.\n\nFirst, to create or control emotion.\n\nFrom the soaring, triumphant music of Jurassic Park\n\nto the ice cream truck version of "Pop Goes the Weasel,"\n\nwhich, for reasons I don’t understand, always makes me cry.\n\nEvoking emotion is the number one use for music.\n\nSo what does that mean for Fallout? Well, one thing the soundtrack does get right is the upbeat tempo\n\nof most of the songs. It cheers up the experience of playing through the wasteland.\n\nExcept for the miserable, inescapable energy of "Johnny Guitar."\n\nPlay it again, my Johnny.\n\nIn the wasteland, you need something to rev you up, keep you moving. And that\'s why this new genre\n\nwill only feature peppy songs.\n\nTwo: remembering or sharing information.\n\nThese can be simple mnemonics like Schoolhouse Rock! Or classic story ballads\n\nlike Kesha’s "TiK ToK."\n\nI actually believe these will be more important than emotions just because\n\nwritten language seems to be pretty dead in the future. It’s all on abandoned computers\n\nor in diaries safely tucked up in a skeleton\'s ribcage.\n\nUp-to-date information is transmitted verbally, and think about how much further it could go if it was sung.\n\nEven an S.O.S. signal gets more traction if it comes with a little ditty,\n\nand I learned that from Rihanna.\n\nThree: Entertainment.\n\n*cheesy music plays*\n\nFour: Jingles. In other words,\n\npropaganda.\n\nCommercial jingles are designed to make you remember brands, and political songs fit here, too.\n\nBecause what is the "Star Spangled Banner" if not America’s jingle?\n\nDespite the amount of remnant advertising for companies like Nuka-Cola and Radiation King,\n\nthe only jingles that remain in Fallout are the ones on Gene Autry’s spurs.\n\n*(I Got Spurs That) Jingle, Jangle, Jingle plays ominously*\n\nIn the song he says his spurs jingl-\n\nFallout does have a few antiquated political songs on Enclave Radio, but as Plato said:\n\n“Any musical innovation is full of danger to the whole State...\n\nwhen modes of music change, the State always changes with them.”\n\nThank you, Plato.\n\nThe transitive property means that the opposite must be true as well.\n\nFallout’s state has very much changed, and so too should the music.\n\nSo our music genre should be catchy to the point of propaganda.\n\nYou hear this song once, and you know the hook and exactly what it wants you to do.\n\nFive: To mark time rhythmically in a group, like a chain gang or rowing.\n\nAn underlying theme of Fallout is a disruption of low-wage labor systems.\n\nHalf the locations are robot warehouses or Nuka-Cola factories\n\nor the industrial goo pit where The Joker was made.\n\nIn the 2100s, commerce is no longer the main structure around\n\nwhich a human’s life is organized.\n\nSo fuck the Man, and fuck the beat he made you drum to.\n\nThe Man was beating you down, so we’re gonna focus on the up-beats.\n\nThe off-beats. Something more syncopated.\n\nThis isn\'t to say we\'re going to get overly complicated with 7/4s and 15/8 time signatures.\n\nThose time signatures only belong in math rock,\n\nwhich is to say in the garbage.\n\nWe’re taking back 4/4 from the Man and we\'re making it our own.\n\nSix: Tradition music, to mark events or occasions.\n\nThis can range from singing "Auld Lang Syne" on New Years\n\nto playing "Pop Goes the Weasel" whenever one of your pet weasels died when you were a kid.\n\nTHAT\'S WHY.\n\nThey’re just songs that usher in a specific moment, like an alarm.\n\nBut most cultures in Fallout don’t seem to use them.\n\nAt the end of the quest “A Nice Day for a Right Wedding,” there is a wedding but no wedding march.\n\nAnd in the quest “For Auld Lang Syne,” they do not play "Auld Lang Syne."\n\nWhich means there’s a real opening to be the only tradition song for every holiday in Fallout.\n\nIt may seem lame to force a tradition song, like making all of your friends call you by a nickname you gave yourself,\n\nbut if you believe that every tradition song came about naturally, you’re naive.\n\nYou think Vitamin C didn’t know that the graduation song would become a once-a-year cash cow?\n\nThat when Green Day was writing “Good Riddance” they weren’t\n\nthinking “Some sitcoms are gonna have to end someday.”\n\nTradition songs can be crafted,\n\nand our first song in this new genre will fit this bill.\n\nSeven: Ambient music or background music.\n\nA.K.A. Chill anime beats to study and relax to.\n\nNobody in Fallout is studying or relaxing. This one is a guide on what not to do in our new genre.\n\nOur genre should be present and aggressive, and when you’re listening to it, you are listening to it.\n\nEight: To create or maintain social groups.\n\nWithout labor to constrict a person’s time or movement,\n\npeople organize into social, cult-like gangs, which makes this category\n\na big one. You’ve got LARPers, the AV club, the rude boys, all of which have their own\n\ncultural standards. But there is a distinct lack of punks, which came about through a\n\nshared political consciousness expressed through music. But we can be that, we just need to\n\ninclude identity-establishing lyrics that appeal to all denizens of the Wasteland.\n\nPerhaps this genre will help unify all of the many warring factions.\n\nOr at least create a new, very cool warring faction.\n\nNumber nine: Stimulating physical movement. Dancing.\n\nThere is no dancing in Fallout! Well, there are a few sex workers in Fallout New Vegas that dance, but it kind\n\nof just looks like the dancing baby gif, so I don’t think that should count.\n\nAnd Fallout 76 hasn’t included a singular dancing emote. All they have are things like “smoking kills”\n\nand “join my polycule?”\n\nThis is probably to avoid overlapping with Fortnite, which\n\ndoes have a pretty long head start on dancing emotes. So for the sake of originality, I\n\nhad my research assistant, Google, find all of the dances that haven\'t been included in Fortnite yet.\n\nIt\'s just a Regency-era quadrille, and skanking.\n\nWe will make it work.\n\nAnd the tenth purpose of music is to use it as a crutch when you can’t think of a different way\n\nto end a video.\n\nActually, I don\'t think this one really applies to the Fallout universe,\n\nso I\'m just gonna take it off.\n\nSo with our nine definitive purposes of music, we can\n\nbegin to build our genre. And the more I’m thinking about these nine purposes, the more\n\nI\'m realizing that Fallout has the opportunity to create the perfect genre. One not tied\n\ndown to the whims of society.\n\nBut I\'m getting ahead of myself.\n\nThe current music in Fallout is overwhelmingly jazz standards and rhythm and blues,\n\nso we\'ll incorporate elements from those genres.\n\nWe’ll have heavy beats, syncopation, rhythm guitar, and honestly, any instrument\n\nthat fits in a mobile wasteland setting. So no pianos, but any marching instrument, like\n\ntrumpets and trombones. Things that stand up to roughing it and also would appeal to\n\nthe Brotherhood of Steel. Another thing these jazz standards excel at is having a powerful,\n\ncatchy melody sung by a main vocalist, but since it’s hard to maintain your safety\n\nas a loner in the wasteland, we can have a lot of backing vocalists, too.\n\nIf you can carry a gun, you can carry a tune.\n\nIn terms of topics for the songs, we\'ll keep the themes\n\nrelevant to the people of Fallout, which based on my experience seems to be freedom from\n\ntyranny, looting, and drinking so I can be stronger and carry more loot.\n\nNow, we mix together these in-fiction elements with our nine definitive purposes of music.\n\nOne: We’re gonna make people happy. Needs to be Jeep commercial music. Yeah, your wife just got\n\neaten by a yao guai, but listen to that skiffle.\n\nTwo: All of our heroes are dead. So it\'s time\n\nto make new heroes. How else are we gonna know how many beers Janice drank last week,\n\nor how far Kevin’s head went flying when a super mutant tagged him with a fire hydrant.\n\nThree:\n\nBangers only.\n\nFour: What should I do with the information about how many beers\n\nJanice drank? Tell me.\n\nThis is music for the scavenger, not the assembly line worker. There’s\n\na whole world of useful scrap out there, and this music should inspire you to get out there\n\nand pick it up!\n\nSix: The old ways are dead! And we\'ve gotta make new songs to celebrate\n\nthe new ways. There is no song for when your Swamp Itch clears up.\n\nBut there should be.\n\nSeven: Background music? NO. This is FOREGROUND MUSIC.\n\nEight: Fallout is a world divided,\n\nawaiting a messiah of music to bring them all together\n\nor at least inspire them to wear cooler clothes.\n\nNine: The music should inspire dances that are violent and rushed, just like\n\nthe world you\'re in. Yeah, your fists are used for melee, but that leaves your feet\n\nand your elbows open to fuckin\' jam!\n\nYou starting to imagine it? You starting to hear those first few notes in your head? THAT’S GOOD!\n\nWhat are we gonna call this new genre that\n\nis peppy! Informational! Good! Catchy! Pick up loot!\n\nTraditional! In your face! Punk!\n\nKicks! Energetic! Educational! Fun! Sticks in your head! Pick it up!\n\nFor your cousin Ben\'s wedding! Right there! Society.\n\n*dancing noises*\n\nSpicy! Slaps hard! Pick it up! Propaganda.\n\nArbor Day! Pick it up!\n\nFuck you, Philip Glass!\n\nPick it up! Let\'s all wear the same shoes!\n\n*repeating "DANCE!" and "PICK IT UP" over and over*\n\nPick it up!\n\n*heavy breathing*\n\nDid I just make Ska again?\n\n*Ska music starts*\n\nYou spend your life living in a vault, and your mind begins to crack.\n\nAnd when you get outside, there’s nothing to welcome you back.\n\nShe found me passed out in a rundown shack with Nuka Buzz in my hand.\n\nShe picked me up and she slapped my face, and said "Come on let’s start a band!"\n\nShe said: START THE MUSIC, Pick up loot, get off your ass!\n\nIf you don’t feel the Brotherhood of Steel, join the Brotherhood of Brass.\n\nShe said: START THE NEW, War never changes, that’s a bore!\n\nYou know we’ll eclipse the apocalypse\n\nwith a loud and brassy SKALLOUT WAR.\n\nSKALLOUT WAR!\n\nSKALLOUT WAR!\n\nSKALLOUT WAAAAAAAAR!\n\nSKALLOUT WAR!\n\nI\'ve never skanked so hard in my life. ', ' Fire Emblem!\n\nThis magnificent franchise pushes the boundaries of gaming by daring to ask the question,\n\n"What if chess made you horny?"\n\nFire Emblem is turning 30 next year, and with 16 main games and few spinoffs,\n\nit\'s safe to say that it has grown into something extraordinary.\n\nThe games are packed with deep storylines and memorable characters, like Marth.\n\nThat\'s not Marth? Marth.\n\nThat\'s- which one is Marth?\n\nMarth.\n\nThe problem with having such a prolific series is that the characters start to blend together.\n\nOne needs only to look at the Super Smash Bros. roster to see that\n\nFire Emblem characters are a bit hard to differentiate.\n\nIt\'s like trying to remember your coworkers\' names after meeting them once at a work mixer.\n\nExcept in this case, your coworkers all have swords and can only make one facial expression.\n\nBut do not worry. There is an answer to this conundrum. Because today,\n\nI\'m going to teach you how to tell apart every Fire Emblem character.\n\n*cheery synth music*\n\nMy face is just not built for this expression.\n\nFirst step in this process is to collect a list of the characters.\n\nTurns out, even after trimming the nonplayable ones and the ones from the Tokyo Mirage Sessions,\n\nthere are nearly 600 Fire Emblem characters.\n\nI cannot explain that many characters.\n\nI have made that mistake before.\n\n"Trying to categorize all 600 Castlevania monsters was a bad idea."\n\nBut the beauty of making mistakes is that you can learn from them. And I now know understand\n\nthat explaining 600 discrete characters wouldn\'t actually be helpful.\n\nHuman beings aren\'t meant to remember 600 people perfectly. If you don\'t believe me,\n\njust try to remember something about every single person in your contact list.\n\nI have a contact for someone name Zain.\n\nAnd in the company, it just says "Bocce Ball."\n\nWho the fuck is this?\n\nBut unlike my contact list, Fire Emblem\'s have plotlines.\n\nAnd in my experience playing these games, I noticed\n\nthat a lot of these different characters fit similar roles in their respective games.\n\nAnd I\'m not the only one who\'s noticed this. On the Fire Emblem wiki, there is a whole list\n\nof archetypes based on different characters.\n\nA list that I only found after spending whole day trying to categorize them on my own.\n\nAnd it\'s just so fun to realize that you\'ve wasted a whole day of work.\n\nBut this list intrigued me.\n\nStock characters in similar circumstances playing again and again in different stories.\n\nDoes that remind you of anything?\n\nOf course it does!\n\nIt reminds you of the commedia dell\'arte,\n\nbecause it reminds me of the commedia dell\'arte.\n\nAnd it\'s so obviously the commedia dell\'arte that I don\'t need to explain it.\n\nBut I will for the sake of extending this video.\n\nThe commedia dell\'arte was an Italian form of theater that was big in the 16th to 18th centuries,\n\nand it relied on stock characters wearing masks or costumes to designate who they were.\n\nThat way the audience could be like,\n\n"Ah, that dude\'s wearing a tight fitting suit with a bunch of weird patches, that must\n\nbe Arlecchino, the servant clown — sometimes to two masters!"\n\nThis brought the audience in immediately. They knew what that character was about without any exposition.\n\nIn the same way, Fire Emblem has dozens of recurring characters that get you through each game.\n\nAnd this is how we\'re going to tell them apart. By defining their archetypes.\n\nFire Emblem goes one step further.\n\nBecause these characters can not only serve the same story purpose,\n\nbut they can have a similar role in the gameplay.\n\nAnd this goes to prove my theory\n\nthat Fire Emblem is not only the spiritual successor to commedia dell\'arte,\n\nit is its natural evolution.\n\nAn elevated form I call...\n\nTHE COMMEDIA DELL\'ANIME.\n\nThe newer, more perfect form of theater.\n\nWe just have to boil down the Fire Emblem personnel into\n\n*kiss*\n\nsyrupy stock characters.\n\nLet\'s begin with the archetypes that are standard.\n\nCain and Abel are battle bros. They fight together, but not in the biblical sense.\n\nBord and Cords are similar except they\'re usually axe fighters.\n\nPegasus sisters are a trio of flying horses ladies.\n\nYou can\'t split these archetypes up into their solo characters because their bond is what defines them.\n\nYou can\'t have a Waluigi without a Luigi.\n\nAnd in the same way, you can\'t have a Bord without a Cord.\n\nWhich is my favorite Dr. Seuss book.\n\nJagens are mentors that are strong in the beginning and then you\'ll quickly outpace them, and it\'s kind of sad.\n\nLike the first time you beat your dad in a basketball game.\n\nOifeys are similar to Jagens,\n\nexcept they\'ll keep dunking on you till you\'re dead.\n\nWendells but for magic.\n\nGotohs are mentors but only the last half of the game.\n\nBeowolfs are mercenaries that you have to pay actual in-game currency\n\nto recruit, and Ogmas are mercenaries that usually decide to join you out of their own volition.\n\nWhich is, by definition, not a mercenary.\n\nNavarres are silent, moody sword swingers.\n\nKind of like if that person who said they studied the blade actually studied the blade.\n\nThere are also a bunch of villains but for different reasons. Power. Ambition. Loyalty.\n\nWyvern riding, I guess.\n\nAnd getting possessed, which is a classic mistake.\n\nSome archetypes are based on their gameplay requirements.\n\nVery difficult to recruit.\n\nUsually recruited after they\'ve been kidnapped.\n\nLate game recruits that could be good, but you have to work hard.\n\nSuper low level villagers that could also be good.\n\nAnd if you recruit one of these pairs,\n\nyou can\'t get the other.\n\nKind of like if two of your friends start dating and then have a really messy breakup.\n\nCorneliuses are usually the parental figure to the main character,\n\nand they have this nasty habit of getting axed super early on in the game.\n\nIt\'s kind of like Fire Emblem doesn\'t know how to make interesting characters without making them\n\nsuffer traumatic parental death.\n\nTacticians. Young female mages. Young female healers.\n\nYoung male mages.\n\nThieves.\n\nJeorges do that thing where they pretend to be not important\n\nand then SURPRISE, I wasn\'t an old crone, I was a magical witch the whole time!\n\nExcept they\'re not very good at hiding the fact that they\'re important.\n\nAnd the creepy version of the Jeorges:\n\nThe Tikis.\n\nUsually they take the form of a small girl or adolescent, except\n\nthey\'re really 400 years old and a god or a dragon.\n\nAnd I honestly do not have the time to unpack this bullshit.\n\nThese 29 archetypes are useful, but they only cover 229 characters.\n\nThere are still 367 to go. If we keep this up, we\'re going to end up with 75 archetypes.\n\nThe commedia dell\'arte only has about 17.\n\nSo before we move on, let\'s combine some.\n\nThese six are all mentors to varying degrees of usefulness.\n\nThese are all defined by their villainy and only some of them become playable.\n\nWelcome to Cain Siblings Incorporated, where we all have a sibling like bond and do the same job.\n\nThese all have very specific requirements for recruiting.\n\nThese both do that thing where they don\'t seem important and then Surprise!\n\nI\'m important!\n\nThese are all hard to make good but they\'re worth it if you put the effort in.\n\nThese are all precocious little magic babies.\n\nAnd that leaves the Navarres unconnected,\n\nbut that\'s because I\'m changing the archetype to Spicy Swords. Because we can include so\n\nmany other characters if we just expand the definitions to any swordweilder\n\nwho\'s a little spicy.\n\nIn fact, by combining these other archetypes, there are now tons of other characters who\n\nfit into these expanded definitions.\n\nWe are left with 288 characters to categorize. But before I get there,\n\nI just want to commend Fire Emblem for have 596 playable characters\n\nand only repeating three names.\n\nWhen I was hired for my first job at a climbing gym,\n\nI was one of five employees named Brian, and it was a small gym.\n\nBut I guess it\'s pretty easy to cut out repetitions when you use dope-ass names like Skrimir.\n\nDagdar.\n\nSleuf.\n\nFjorm.\n\nBelf.\n\nI could go on all day.\n\nBut I won\'t. Because it\'s time to get the rest of the archetypes on the wall.\n\n*charging noise*\n\nThat took like 30 minutes. But let\'s begin.\n\nThe honorable knight, like Fiona, who cares passionately about her people,\n\nand will always oppose cruelty to civilians.\n\nWhich is way better than the loyal knight, like Troude, who only is loyal\n\nto Perne, and will do literally anything for him even though Perne is a bad dude.\n\nBut I\'ll get to that later.\n\nThese four archetypes are calm and aloof, and the only thing that differentiates them\n\nis how much you would want to invite them to your birthday party.\n\nI\'m just gonna get the blank slate archetype out of the way now,\n\nbecause Fire Emblem is a game with permadeath,\n\nand so sometimes you just need more meat for the grinder, you know?\n\nSimilar to the blank slate is the protagonist,\n\nwhich is always relatively heroic, but since they\'re a conduit for the player, they\'re all pretty vague.\n\nI realize that by smooshing them all together into one category,\n\nI\'ve made the majority of the Fire Emblem roster in Super Smash indistinguishable.\n\nBut that\'s not my fault!\n\nSuper Smash should\'ve included more magic babies!\n\nArrogants, hotheads, and edgelords all have a mean side,\n\nbut arrogants like Vaike just think they\'re the best.\n\nHotheads like Caspar want to fight anything that moves.\n\nAnd edgelords like Niles retweet Joker accounts unironically.\n\nA lot of these characters have rough childhoods but then turn out cheerful despite that.\n\nAnd then there\'s the inferiority complex archetype, which I could have just called\n\n"The majority of children in Fire Emblem: Fates."\n\nPerfectionists, mischief makers, and flirts are all highly motivated.\n\nBut Subaki is motivated to meet high expectations.\n\nClaude is motivated to make intricate schemes.\n\nAnd Sylvain is motivated to be a fuccboi.\n\nBuzzkills are just characters that aren\'t very fun to talk to.\n\nAnd Fire Emblem, I will never forgive you for naming an unemotional, uber religious, deadbeat dad Gilbert.\n\nIt also doesn\'t help that I look like Hanneman Lite.\n\nOh god, am I a buzzkill?\n\nA lot of these archetypes are based around one singular personality trait.\n\nScarlet\'s straightforward. Valbar\'s chill.\n\nLinhardt\'s lazy. Sumia\'s clumsy. Petra\'s a sweetie.\n\nAnd Ranulf is a furry.\n\nDramatic, painter, and fashionable are defined by their love of the arts\n\nand how much it sucks that they gotta be a soldier instead.\n\nSome archetypes upset the status quo by defying gender norms\n\nor by calling out the noble class, and that\'s why they\'re comrades.\n\nChild soldier.\n\nKarin is canonically 14 years old.\n\nWhoopsie!\n\nBut even if they aren\'t a child, they could still be naive.\n\nWhich brings around the overprotective archetype,\n\nwhich is just essentially helicopter parents.\n\nManuela is constantly drinking and flirting and just being a hot mess and I love her for it.\n\nAnd that makes her the president of vices.\n\nThe vice president.\n\nBut be careful not to do that around someone like Astram, who is constantly accusing people of treason\n\nfor no good reason.\n\nThere\'s a lot of characters in the meek murderer archetype\n\nbecause Fire Emblem loves to make characters that are quiet and shy and really self conscious,\n\nand then can WRECK SHOP on the battlefield.\n\nHere\'s an archetype I call "what the fuck" and it\'s the three characters that make me say,\n\n"What the fuck, Fire Emblem?"\n\nPeople like Perne, who is said to be a sweet Robin Hood type,\n\nexcept he does kidnap a young girl and keeps her as his slave.\n\nOr Tharja, who practices curses on her own daughter.\n\nOr Roger, who is act- he\'s not actually that bad.\n\nBut Fire Emblem does go out of their way to make his endscreen say that he never gets a date\n\nand he stays single for the rest of his life.\n\nAnd it\'s like, what the fuck, Fire Emblem? You didn\'t have to do him dirty like that.\n\nThe next archetype is called "actually pretty interesting." These characters are three dimensional\n\nand well-developed. People like Libra, who struggles with his faith and has incredible\n\nself doubt even though he\'s doing all he can to help those around him. Or Rhys, who dreams\n\nof being a swordfighter, but his weak constitution won\'t allow him to become one. And so he helps\n\nin the ways he can, but his whole story is one of unfulfilled dreams.\n\nAnd that\'s it.\n\nThose are the only two interesting characters in Fire Emblem.\n\nUntil we get to Raphael.\n\nMy sweet, bulky boy who only cares about eating and training and not about studying.\n\nThe thing is, the Fire Emblem world has moved past himbos and bimbos.\n\nWelcome to the age of thembos.\n\nThere. 45 archetypes to help you differentiate the 596 Fire Emblem characters.\n\nIf you\'re a GOSH DANG ROCKET SCIENTIST!\n\n45 is still too much! We can combine these.\n\nWe\'ll take these six and combine them to create a new archetype that is as important as it is bland.\n\nThese three can be more succinctly summarized in a category called\n\n"Holy shit, why are you a soldier?"\n\nLet\'s just go ahead and cordon off all of the assholes.\n\nAnd now we can take these straight-talking suck ups and call them teacher\'s pets.\n\nShhhh.\n\nThese three archetypes all have tough exteriors to break through.\n\nThese three archetypes really explore familial bonds,\n\nwhich is a RARE CONDITION, IN THIS DAY-\n\nWhether it\'s a good or bad reaction doesn\'t matter to this group, they just want to be seen.\n\nThey\'re just too nice for all this!\n\nThese four archetypes will always be subverting expectations.\n\nIt\'s fairly surprising that these three archetypes were let in.\n\nChill dudes? Gambling? A bunch of hunks?\n\nDamn if these aren\'t fun to hang out with.\n\nAll three of these are going to time out, \'cause they need to calm it down.\n\nAnd there we go.\n\nThe 13 archetypes that make it possible to differentiate the Fire Emblem characters.\n\nJust 13 of them.\n\nThat\'s fewer than the commedia dell\'arte.\n\nIt\'s only 13.\n\nWhich is not only an unlucky number,\n\nbut it is TOO LARGE for your TINY CHILD BRAINS.\n\nWe can make it better! We can combine more! WE CAN PERFECT THIS!\n\nGranted, it\'s a little bit harder to combine these archetypes, but just off the bat, we can take\n\n"look at me baby" and "making waves" and just combine it into one thing, trendsetters.\n\nAnd the "necessary but boring" and the "asshole crew" and the "teacher\'s pets" and the "calm it downs,"\n\nthey all fill me with a sense of UGH.\n\nAnd obviously the "too nice for this" and the "lied on your resume" and the "holy shit why are you a soldiers"\n\nare all just a bad choice for a war!\n\nAnd that just leaves us with the characters that are hard to break\n\nthe ice with, and uh, the ones that got family issues, and the quiet ones, and the ones that\n\nare fun to hang out with!\n\nUh.\n\nAnd that just sounds like a pretty run-of-the-mill\n\nawkward family reunion.\n\nAnd when you think about it, these ones are just strange characters that\n\nhave, uh, that are good at fighting.\n\nI mean if you include Dmitri in this, he has an eye patch!\n\nOkay, which is similar to these ones.\n\nSeteth and Byleth have the, they rhyme.\n\nUh we also, I mean.\n\nDorothea wears a hat until she grows out of the hat.\n\nThink about that!\n\nDon\'t even get me started on Oboro.\n\nI don\'t know who that is.\n\nIs it pronounced "dice" or "deesay?"\n\nAnd we can have a category called\n\n"anime character with a singular personality trait and a penchant for violence"\n\nand that\'s just the one category!\n\nWhich PROVES that the Fire Emblem characters are all essentially the same,\n\nand that you cannot differentiate them.\n\nMission complete!\n\nWhat was this Unraveled about again?\n\n...Sometimes to two masters!\n\nPatrick: Now Italian.\n\n(Brian in a shitty Italian accent) Ah! That guy is...\n\noh god I don\'t know if I can.\n\nAh that dudes wearing a tight fitting suit with a buncha weird patches it\n\nmust be Arlecchino the servant clown sometimesa to two masters!\n\n(Pat and Jenna offscreen laughing)\n\nBrian: Ah I don\'t know if... Okay.\n\nPat: We don\'t have to use it but we need to record it. ', ' Should auld acquaintance be forgot.\n\nAnd\n\nall\n\nthat\n\nJAZZ.\n\nTHAT’S RIGHT FRIENDS it’s Game of the Year season!\n\nWhich means it\'s time for us to hop on those message boards, chat about our favorite games,\n\nand tear out each other’s throats when someone expresses an opinion\n\nthat is slightly different from our own.\n\nBy this point, pretty much every gaming publication has announced their Game of the Year...\n\nuhh...\n\nwhich means that I\'m a bit late.\n\nAnything that I say is just a drop in the ocean of discourse.\n\nNo one wants to hear my opinion.\n\nWHICH IS WHY I AM NOT EXPRESSING AN OPINION.\n\nI AM STATING A FACT.\n\nThat’s right, I have devised a statistical, analytical, number-crunching formula\n\nthat will SCIENTIFICALLY PROVE\n\nTHE GAME OF THE YEAR.\n\n*hype 80s music plays*\n\nThey said it couldn’t be done.\n\nA bias-free formula to calculate the game of the year?\n\nThat\'s a fool’s errand, Brian!\n\nYou are a fool!\n\nThey called me a fool!\n\nBut do I look like a fool to you?\n\nI’ve done it, and with the knowledge I have found, I can go ahead and assuage any arguments\n\nyou might have with your friends.\n\nThere is nothing to debate anymore, there is only the truth, that the best game of the year is...\n\nhidden somewhere, um, in these spreadsheets.\n\nI\'m gonna be honest with you, I haven’t...\n\nthere are a lot of numbers.\n\nAnd I haven\'t had the time to, uh, do them all just yet.\n\nBut it’s only December 14th.\n\nThis video is set to go up on the 30th, which means I still have two weeks for new games\n\nto come in before I can really call which game is the game of the year.\n\nBut I\'ve at least finished the formula, and I’ve tested it on a few to make sure it\n\nruns correctly.\n\nAnd everyone knows that you can’t get full credit unless you show your work.\n\nSo let me show you how I made it.\n\nFirst thing you gotta do when you\'re making a GOTY formula is find your list of games.\n\nAnd obviously we\'re going to have to choose every single game that was released this year\n\nin order for us to say that it is scientifically accurate.\n\nSo if we just go ahead and take a look at Steam and see how many were released since\n\nJanuary 1st 20-hmm.\n\nThat\'s over 15,000.\n\nYou can\'t make me do that, legally.\n\nThat\'s not in my contract.\n\nRight?\n\nI can\'t... they can\'t legally make me do that.\n\nLook, as much as video game reviews can be an imperfect reflection of the person who\n\nis writing them, they are still a pretty solid baseline for which video games mattered in our culture.\n\nEven if a review is bad, it still means it was good enough for someone to spend time on it.\n\nSo I went Metacritic and I took all the games that were rated 80 or above, and at\n\nthe time of writing this script, that was 181 games.\n\nSo I\'m gonna do the formula for all of those.\n\nSome of these games were DLCs or re-releases onto new platforms.\n\nThe Switch alone resurrected about a dozen candidates from years past.\n\nBut since they were released this year, they are still technically in the running.\n\nFight me.\n\nNow that we have the list, it\'s time to make the formula, and it might surprise you to\n\nhear this, but I have not been in a pure mathematics class in about five years.\n\nSo I reached out to some scientists.\n\nAnd then none of them got back to me.\n\nSo I called my old roommate.\n\n“Hey, I’m Nicholas.\n\nI’m a graduate student studying exoplanet atmospheres.”\n\nNick is working toward a PhD at MIT, and though I was a bit worried about reaching out to\n\nhim since his specialization is in astrophysics and not stats about video games,\n\nhe assuaged all my fears.\n\nBrian - "Would you say you are a math expert?”\n\nNick - “No.”\n\nWe chatted for about a half an hour, diving deep into the scientific method and the selfless\n\ngoals of discovery.\n\nBrian - “If I invent a unit... can I trademark it.”\n\nNick - “I think your final score should be, like, in Gilberts or whatever.”\n\nBrian - "OK!"\n\nAnd we finished our chat with the reassurance that this formula was not only going to help\n\nthe gaming community, but the scientific community at large.\n\nBrian - “Do you think if I wrote this up, I could get it published in, like, Nature?"\n\nNick - “No.”\n\nSo where to do we go from here now that we have been scientifically rejuvenated?\n\nIt\'s time to build the criteria.\n\nWhat specifically makes a game of the year?\n\nNumber one, what is the game worth?\n\nWe\'re not just talking about monetary worth, we\'re also talking about the amount of enjoyment\n\nyou get while playing the game.\n\nNumber two, how them graphics?\n\nWe’re trying to find specific numbers associated with these games, and graphics is just a bunch\n\nof numbers anyway, so this will be a useful part.\n\nNumber three, how did it affect the cultural miasma?\n\nLook, it’s all about those google results, how many people are talking about the game?\n\nAnd most importantly, is the game art?\n\nI\'ve figured it out.\n\nWhich means that no one has to write any more goddamn thinkpieces about this topic ever again!\n\nGiven these four criteria, I sat down with Tara Long, former bioinformatics researcher\n\nand also my current boss.\n\nShe and I figured out a formula that will end up with a numerical value that will tell\n\nus the game of the year.\n\nThe higher the number, the better the game.\n\nWe’ll start with game worth.\n\nNow it’s hard for us to find how worth it a game is to play from a numerical standpoint,\n\nbut if you take Metacritic’s score as a percentage of the game you enjoy, and you\n\nmultiply that by the average amount of minutes each playthrough takes using the stats from\n\nhowlongtobeat.com, then you end up with a number of minutes you have spent enjoying said game.\n\nNow, to tie in material worth, we want to go ahead and take in the original listed price\n\nof the game and divide it by this number so that way we can end up with a DPM: dollars\n\nper minute enjoyed.\n\nNow, it’s hard to decide if you want a high or a low DPM, because some people want the\n\nmost bang for their buck, while others are willing to spend a little bit more for a really\n\nwell-enjoyed minute.\n\nBut just to standardize this, I\'m going to assume lower is better — that means you\'ve\n\npaid less per minute you\'ve enjoyed — and that way I can use it to divide literally\n\nthe rest of the equation.\n\nHOW BOUT THEM GRAPHICS?\n\nIn the past few years, people have cared less and less about how many\n\npolygons you\'ve got on the screen and more about the style.\n\nBut one thing that hasn\'t changed is frame rate.\n\nPeople want the most frames per second.\n\nSo, factually, the more frames, the better.\n\nThat means we\'re going to go ahead and take the highest frame rate available in the game\n\nand we\'re gonna multiply that by the seconds of average playthrough, again from howlongtobeat.com.\n\nAnd that will give us the amount of frames per game.\n\nThe game frames mainframe.\n\nBut how many frames does a gamer game in the gameframe mainframe?\n\nThat\'s a good question.\n\nNow if you go ahead and you take your frames per game and divide it by the number of gamers,\n\nI’m talking about however many copies have been sold or however many number of downloads\n\nthere have been, then that\'s going to leave you with frames per game per gamer, and that’s\n\na really important number, because if you have 200,000 frames per game and you have\n\n200,000 gamers, that\'s 200,000 gamers that have only had one frame per game per gamer.\n\nAnd that is no good, is it?\n\nIs it?\n\nI actually have... um, I\'m a little confused now.\n\nWe\'re gonna take frames per game per gamer and we\'re gonna put it on the top of this\n\nequation, because we want it to be the biggest number possible.\n\nAnd now it’s time for cultural relevancy.\n\nWe want our games of the year to be big and brash and bold and boisterous, letting people\n\noutside of the gaming world know,\n\nHey!\n\nThis is a thing!\n\nSo how do we judge a game’s effect on the world at large?\n\nWell, we go ahead and we take all of the Google results that come up when you search\n\nthe game\'s full name and the word game.\n\nBut that’s not everything, right?\n\nThat\'s just the bare minimum.\n\nIt\'s like saying, “This dude’s bad haircut is important just because a lot of people are talking about it,”\n\nwhich I know isn’t true from personal experience.\n\nSo I went on twitter and I asked you lovely folks what descriptors you expect to see in\n\ndescriptions of games of the year.\n\nAnd you gave me a lot.\n\nSo I went ahead and I plugged all those into Google’s advanced search along with the\n\ngame\'s name, and I took those results and I multiplied it by the base Google search.\n\nAnd I got very big numbers.\n\nBut don\'t worry, we\'re going to bring these numbers down to size, because some of the\n\ndescriptions you sent in were actually pretty negative descriptions of games.\n\nSo I did a Google search using those descriptions, and then I multiplied those results by one\n\nplus the number of Funko Pops made of characters in the game,\n\nwhich is objectively a terrible thing.\n\nNow this is going to leave you with BCE, or your base cultural effect, and we\'re gonna\n\nmultiply that by our FPGPG in order to get a pretty big number.\n\nBut before we’re done with cultural effect, I want you to ask yourself, is this the culture at large?\n\nDoes this go outside of our gaming bubble?\n\nThere’s really only one way to tell that, and that\'s by using the M.O.M. variable,\n\nwhich stands for: "My Own Mother."\n\nSo I called my own mother for help.\n\n"Hello, Brian, I\'m a follower and a subscriber as well as your mother."\n\nBrian - "That\'s very good to hear.\n\nI... you support me so well and I appreciate that.\n\nI should ask you, Mom, would you consider yourself a gamer?"\n\nMom - "When I play Mario Kart with, like, grandchildren and things like that, I always\n\ngo off the road."\n\nBrian - "That\'s, but, on purpose to let them feel better."\n\nMom - "Very similar to my real-life driving skills, I find."\n\nBrian - "I have a list of 181 video games, now I know that\'s a lot.\n\nI\'m basically gonna run through this, and I\'m gonna ask you if you have heard of this game.\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2."\n\nMom - "No."\n\nBrian - "God of War."\n\nMom - "Yes!\n\nI have heard of that."\n\nBrian - "Oh, OK!"\n\nWhile subjecting my mom to a litany of 2018\'s best games,\n\nit became clear that she was very interested in the topic.\n\nBrian - "We\'re only 57 in, so we\'ve still got another 130 to go."\n\nMom - "I can\'t tell you how, what an exciting time this is for me."\n\nBrian - "Now you get taste of what it\'s like to do my job."\n\nMom - "I tell you what, this is a lot of research into things that really have very little meaning."\n\nBrian - "You\'re right.\n\nIt is."\n\nSo once I had asked my mom about all of the games from the game of the year list, I was\n\nable to throw it into a boolean function.\n\nIf mom knows game equals true, then that’s a plus one here.\n\nAnd then I could raise our base cultural effect to the power of mom, so if she doesn\'t know\n\nit, that\'s just to the power of one.\n\nIf she does, that\'s to the power of two.\n\nFinally, it’s time for our fourth, and perhaps most important criteria: Is this game art?\n\nAnd when you start asking if something is art, then you really end up asking,\n\n"Why should we even be defining what is and isn\'t art?"\n\nAnd the only thing worse than discourse about "are games art?" is\n\nthe discourse ABOUT the discourse of "are games art?"\n\nLook, art is experiential and that\'s a beautiful thing that should be allowed to flourish without\n\nhaving some pseudoscientific proof of greatness thrust upon it.\n\nWhich is why I\'m not proving greatness.\n\nInstead, this part of the formula is so revolutionary because I am proving art.\n\nSo let\'s go ahead and throw this into...\n\nShit, I ran out of space.\n\nYou know what, this part wasn\'t that important.\n\nWe\'re just gonna cut it.\n\nThis big GOTY equation ends up with very large numbers, which would be too hard to show all of.\n\nSo I needed to make a new unit.\n\nSomething I could reduce them all down to.\n\nI plugged in my favorite game of the year, Celeste, and I used that to be our new baseline.\n\nCeleste equals one BDG.\n\nOr Big Determinant of Game.\n\nEverything else will be reduced down using Celeste’s score to a scale of BDGs.\n\nSo that\'s it.\n\nThat’s the entire formula.\n\nAnd if you\'ll excuse me, I have to go do my dark bidding on these spreadsheets and I will\n\ncome back to you right now.\n\nDecember 30th.\n\nNew year is at our doorstep.\n\nKnock knock!\n\nWho’s there?\n\nIt’s 2019!\n\nCome on in, hope you\'re not as big of an asshole as the past few of your friends!\n\nI spent the past two weeks crunching the numbers, and it is my honor to announce that\n\n2018’s scientifically calculated game of the year, with 19...\n\ntrillion BDGs...\n\nis Fortnite.\n\nThat can\'t be the right number, I\'m gonna...\n\nNo, that\'s right.\n\nYou remember when Pluto stopped being a planet, and the scientists were like,\n\n"Hey, that\'s just what the definitions say!"\n\nAnd we were like,\n\n"Hey, scientists, maybe your definitions are busted!"\n\nMaybe my formula is busted.\n\nThe fact that God of War got 2.1 million BDGs and Red Dead Redemption 2 got 0.1 BDG...\n\nMaybe I shouldn\'t have made my mom\'s knowledge of the game an exponential factor.\n\nBrian - "You know Tetris.\n\nYou would really like this Tetris..."\n\nMom - *sings the entire Tetris song*\n\nNo, I stand by that decision.\n\nLet’s be honest, the stats I was using definitely favored cultural importance, and Fortnite’s\n\ncultural effect was orders of magnitude larger than any other game this year.\n\nAnd though I\'ve never played Fortnite\n\n— which proves my lack of bias and also that I’m professionally irresponsible —\n\nthere can be no denying that it has made a lasting impact\n\noutside of the video game world.\n\nIt’s the only nonseries game that my mom knew about.\n\nAnd regardless of how you feel about the Fortnite, it drew together a collection of people that\n\nmight not have otherwise connected, and that’s a valuable thing.\n\nAnd even when your Uncle Devin comes up to you at the holiday get together and says,\n\n“HEY BRIAN, WHAT IN THE HECK IS THIS FORTNITE THING?”\n\nit gives you a common ground to chat,\n\nand you really haven\'t chatted with Uncle Devin in a while.\n\nYou should call him more often.\n\nHe wants to show you his Civil War books.\n\nAnd his collection of swords.\n\nBut if you’re upset, and you didn’t IMMEDIATELY close this YouTube tab to send me an angry tweet,\n\nI’ve got an extra little gift for you.\n\nIt\'s a new formula.\n\nGOTY equals x times 1 quadrillion.\n\nAnd x equals your favorite game.\n\nOf this year.\n\nNow you can go ahead and tell your friends that Brian scientifically proved that my favorite game\n\nis the game of the year, and then you can share them this link,\n\nand then they won’t click on it because it’s a 15 minute video, so your secret is safe with me.\n\nAnd to be honest, your favorite game deserves it,\n\nbecause if you liked it enough to call it your game of the year,\n\nthen it must be pretty meaningful to you,\n\nand no one can take that away.\n\nSo congratulations, Fortnite, and congratulations, your favorite game.\n\nHere’s hoping 2019 is full of wonderful games and even more wonderful experiences.\n\n*wink*\n\nHappy New Year.\n\nOH.\n\nOH MY GOD THAT IS SO HOT.\n\nOHHH MY GOD.\n\nIT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PROP WATER, PAT.\n\nOH I PROBABLY JUST LIKE RUINED THIS MIC, TOO.\n\nJESUS, PAT.\n\nI TOLD YOU IT WAS PROP WATER.\n\nGOD.\n\nI\'m okay.\n\nMom - "Does enthusiasm count or anything like that?\n\nShould it just be, or just be, just bare bones..."\n\nBrian - "Mom, to be honest, I don\'t think you can do this not enthusiastically, so,\n\nyou\'re gonna be fine." ', ' PC gaming is a vast ocean of entertainment,\n\nand if you want to explore, all you have to do is sail out.\n\nAnd speaking of selling out,\n\nthis is my first-ever sponsored video!\n\nThat\'s right, the-\n\nthe folks over at Riot have decided to corporately sanction\n\na video from a man who is best known\n\nfor hanging sad clown portraits in his apartment.\n\nYou see, they just released VALORANT,\n\nand since I\'m currently stuck at home\n\nthey were kind enough to give me a budget\n\nto help turbocharge my computer,\n\nso that way I could unravel how to get good at PC gaming.\n\nBut the thing about VALORANT\n\nis that you don\'t need a high-end PC to play it.\n\nRiot told me that even on an old clunker\n\nwith minimum specs, you can still play competitively.\n\nAnd sure enough, I excavated my ancient PC\n\nin order to test this, and it played great.\n\n- It plays great.\n\nOh, that doesn\'t count.\n\nSo I could use that sponsorship money\n\nto soup up my computer or I could use it\n\nto solve one of PC gaming\'s biggest problems.\n\nUnlike a console, which can plug into a communal TV,\n\ntrue PC gaming needs a dedicated space.\n\nI live in a three-bedroom apartment with two other roommates\n\nand they are not gonna be cool with me\n\nsetting up my sick rig in the spot where we keep\n\nrecycling that we haven\'t taken out in two weeks.\n\nIn fact, the only unused personal space I have\n\nis this four-foot square right next to my radiator.\n\nAnd I like to keep that block unused\n\nfor whenever I wanna feel like a rich person.\n\n- Check me out!\n\nBut maybe, with a little help from my sponsor...\'s money,\n\nI can turn those 16 square feet into a gamer\'s paradise.\n\nToday I\'m teaching you how to make the perfect gamer space.\n\n(lively dance music)\n\nOh!\n\nYeah!\n\nFor inspiration, I asked a couple coworkers\n\nwhat they look for in a PC gaming space.\n\n- Hi, I\'m Jeff Ramos.\n\n- I\'m Julia.\n\nIf there was anyone at Polygon who could lead me\n\nto gamer space perfection it would be Jeff and Julia,\n\nand in our discussions it became clear\n\nthat there are four major elements\n\nto a good gaming environment.\n\nThe first is a solid foundation.\n\nIf I want to build a PC gaming space,\n\nwhere should I start?\n\n- First, I think you need a computer.\n\n- Check!\n\nBut without these other foundational elements,\n\nI\'ll have less of a gamer space\n\nand more of an ominous obelisk.\n\nFrom there, you can start embellishing your foundation\n\nwith element two, a virtual gaming space,\n\nwhich is just a fancy way of saying\n\na place you can stream games from.\n\n- It made me feel a little less lonely\n\nas I\'m studying and stuff,\n\nbecause there\'s just like a voice.\n\nAnd I guess I wanted to do that for people, also.\n\n- Streaming for you was less about\n\ngetting big and it was more about\n\nsharing an experience with your friends.\n\n- If I got big along the way I would be like, "That\'s fine."\n\n- Element three is aesthetics.\n\nIf you\'re gonna spend hours at your computer,\n\nat the very least it should be nice to look at,\n\nand it should represent you.\n\n- Everything else at my desk is black.\n\nThere\'s very little decoration, and I like that\n\n\'cause it\'s clear mind, I can just focus\n\non what I\'m doing at any given moment,\n\nversus looking at a desk full of Funko Pops.\n\n- I had, I think, this specific Pop figure\n\nof Vi from "League of Legends."\n\nand then it just kind of expanded.\n\nSince I work from home, too,\n\nI try to make my space fun and engaging.\n\n- And the final element: Caters to bodily needs.\n\n- What type of chair is that that you\'re sitting in?\n\n- Oh, it\'s a terrible one and it\'s going to be replaced.\n\nAnd it gives me consistent back pain.\n\n- Does that affect your gaming at all?\n\n- If I\'m not comfortable, then I\'m just thinking,\n\n"Dang, my butt hurts, my back hurts,"\n\nand then I can\'t pay attention to things.\n\n- Do you ever eat near your computer?\n\nDo you ever have to refuel?\n\n- I try to separate eating from my desk space.\n\nThere is a space off to the left where I usually\n\nwill always have a coffee cup and a water bottle,\n\nand sometimes there\'ll be like a snack.\n\n- When you\'re in the throes of a match,\n\nyou don\'t wanna be worried about your back hurting\n\nor feeling a little famished,\n\nand that means your gamer space should provide\n\nthe fuel and comfort your body needs.\n\nIf you can amalgamate these four elements,\n\nyou\'ll have a good gamer space.\n\nBut I\'m making the perfect one.\n\nAnd how can we prove it\'s perfect?\n\nAn increase in gaming performance!\n\nHa ha, you thought I wasn\'t gonna do\n\nwhat I was sponsored to do!\n\nGet outta here, I\'m just killin\' two birds with one stone!\n\nMy coworkers said in no uncertain terms\n\nthat a good gamer space will make me a better gamer.\n\nOnce I have a dedicated space,\n\nthat\'s gonna be all I\'m gonna need\n\nin order to be proficient at this game?\n\n- Well, you should still practice a little bit, I mean--\n\n- Though I normally don\'t let little things like rules\n\nstand between me and victory,\n\n"Valorant" has anti-cheat software\n\nthat kinda makes that impossible,\n\nso there really is no way for me\n\nto get good at this game without practicing.\n\nBut a perfect gamer space will envelop me\n\nin a cocoon of learning,\n\nshutting out the world around me.\n\nBy the end of this build, I\'ll prove\n\nthat I\'ve developed a perfect gamer space\n\nby showing just how much better at PC gaming I\'ve become.\n\nLuckily, that\'s not a very high bar.\n\nThat doesn\'t count.\n\nAnd with my four elements defined, it was time to start.\n\nI taped out the four-by-four square\n\nand purchased a desk that would fit within the perimeter,\n\nbuilt the desk, got the monitor unpacked,\n\ncomputer, keyboard, mouse in position,\n\nand we were in business.\n\nElement one, check.\n\nI hopped right into "Valorant," and things were going\n\nway better than with my coffee table setup.\n\nAnd in hindsight,\n\nmaybe I should\'ve stopped there.\n\nBut I still had money to burn.\n\nYou see, I really was getting better at "Valorant,"\n\nbut I had no way of clearly showing\n\njust how well I was doing.\n\nAnd as Jeff said--\n\n- \'Cause if I no-scope and there\'s no one around to see it,\n\nthen does it matter?\n\n- I ordered a nice microphone and got out my old webcam\n\nto set up my streaming space.\n\nAll right, check, check.\n\nWe are set to go, everything looks great on the... game.\n\nThings do not look as great...\n\nAlthough I was prepared to start gaming for the masses,\n\nmy room was not.\n\nI can do better than this.\n\nIf I go live with this setup,\n\neveryone\'s gonna make fun of my finger-jointed\n\nbuilder\'s-grade garbage molding!\n\nI can\'t be known as the substandard molding guy.\n\nLuckily, I had two sources of inspiration\n\nfor gamer space aesthetics on opposite\n\nsides of the spectrum.\n\nI wanted to land somewhere in the middle.\n\nObviously, the first step\n\nwas installing RGB LEDs, because a gamer space\n\nwithout constantly changing rainbow lights\n\nis like a little league coach without wraparound Oakleys.\n\nI also purchased a modest number of game figurines,\n\nbecause even with a sponsor,\n\nhoo boy, those things are expensive.\n\nBut at the end of this, my space still felt pretty empty,\n\nso I gathered all the figurines I could find.\n\nAll of them.\n\nBeyond this, there was nothing behind me\n\nto brand me as a true gamer for the stream viewers,\n\nso I mocked up a quick poster idea\n\nand sent it over to my coworker Pat\n\nfor some illustration work,\n\nand used a little bit more of that sponsor money\n\nto purchase a large cloth banner.\n\nOh my god.\n\nIt\'s perfect.\n\nFinally, I purchased a video game-themed birthday party set,\n\nand with that my aesthetic was complete.\n\nWhat\'s up, y\'all!\n\nI am back at it at the streaming setup.\n\nWe\'ve got everyone here.\n\nYou can tell, as I always say back there,\n\ndon\'t talk to me before I\'ve had my gaming.\n\nI just have a little, there\'s actually nothing in this cup.\n\nI should probably get something into this cup.\n\nJeff warned me about keeping snacks off my desk,\n\nbut I was worried about getting hangry\n\nin the middle of gaming.\n\nSo I prepped some peanut butter toast.\n\nAlso, Julia had a specific piece of advice\n\nabout emotional needs.\n\n- I have one of the guy from Beastars,\n\nso when I get too mad about playing video games\n\nI can look at him and he\'ll soothe me.\n\n- Though the sight of an anthropomorphic wolf\n\nisn\'t necessarily soothing to me,\n\nI do think it\'s important for me to have something\n\nto calm me down after the rough matches:\n\nWarm milk.\n\nAnd I still had some sponsorship money left over,\n\nso I purchased myself a gamer chair.\n\nUnfortunately, the only one that could ship in time\n\nwas the largest size, which meant\n\nI had to rearrange some furniture.\n\nAnd with that, the perfect gamer space was complete,\n\nall four elements checked.\n\nThe gamer space is created,\n\nand all that\'s left for me to do\n\nis be the gamer within the space.\n\nI played a few matches, taking a sip from the warm milk\n\nany time I got a little flustered.\n\nBut for some reason, I wasn\'t much better\n\nthan when I started this journey.\n\nIt\'s just that my wrists hurt.\n\nThat\'s the only reason why things aren\'t going great.\n\nEven after running to the drugstore\n\nto pick up some compression braces,\n\nmy gaming didn\'t improve.\n\nIt didn\'t make any sense.\n\nI had spent over a week building this gamer space,\n\nwhich included dozens of minutes playing VALORANT.\n\nWhy wasn\'t I any better?\n\nThe space isn\'t perfect yet.\n\nThat\'s the only explanation.\n\nI hadn\'t reached my goal of being a better PC gamer.\n\nBut I also hadn\'t run out of sponsor money.\n\nIt was time for a second pass.\n\nMy single monitor wasn\'t giving me\n\nenough screen real estate for what really mattered:\n\nMy stream setup.\n\nSo I got a second one, and also some nice lights.\n\nWe have now upgraded our new space.\n\nI can now see my game, and I can also see\n\nwhat my stream setup\'s gonna be.\n\nIt\'s lookin\' good.\n\nEnough.\n\nBut good enough is never enough\n\nwhen one is striving for perfection.\n\nThe problem with streaming is that most people are okay\n\nwith one camera and one game.\n\nI am an auteur who understand the importance\n\nof cilimintography, and if I\'m supposed to stream\n\nin a manner that matches my ourverver,\n\nI NEED.\n\nMORE.\n\nCAMERAS.\n\nSadly, pretty much every webcam is currently sold out.\n\nI was running low on time,\n\nand that\'s one thing sponsor money can\'t buy.\n\nBut it can buy enterprise level\n\nvideo conferencing solutions.\n\nJust wanted to check in really quickly\n\nto let you know that\n\nI am unstoppable!\n\n*CACKLING*\n\n- [Roommate] Brian!\n\n- Sorry.\n\nI figured out how to do three cams on OBS,\n\nand now I can play a game.\n\nWhich is great, except looking at the overlay,\n\nit\'s a little busy.\n\nOur little test proved that there were\n\ntwo big issues with our space.\n\nThe first was that the cameras took up most of the screen.\n\nThe second is that my roommates didn\'t enjoy hearing me yell,\n\nwhich is nothing new.\n\nBut that\'s when it hit me.\n\nI have a plan on how to kill two birds with one stone:\n\nBy recycling all of the boxes I\'ve received.\n\nIf I could create a soundproof box around my gamer space\n\nand cover it in a green screen,\n\nthen I\'d have more screen space\n\nand my roommates would stop yelling at me.\n\nSo I used more of my sponsorship money\n\nto buy a bunch of expensive studio foam,\n\nand I taped it to a bunch of cardboard.\n\nAnd then I threw a green screen over the top of it\n\nand viola, a hermetically sealed gamer space.\n\nNow, a few of you might be wondering,\n\n"How does one get into this space?"\n\nBut you\'ll see that right behind my air conditioning unit,\n\nthere\'s a way that I can crawl underneath there.\n\nAnd the best part about it, it\'s not even dark\n\nbecause we\'ve got the... I put in the LEDs!\n\nAll I have to do is just weasel my way in.\n\nThey say, "No pain, no gain."\n\nAnd you know, I\'m a gamer\n\n"No pame, no game."\n\nMaybe that\'s better than my current slogan.\n\nOh, get the head through first,\n\n\'cause that\'s the hardest part of it, you know.\n\nJust kinda like...\n\nbeing born.\n\nAh, okay.\n\nOh.\n\nDo a quick one 180.\n\nAnd then you swap up, and then you\'re here.\n\nAnd then you\'re in the,\n\n(sighs) and then you\'re in the gamer space.\n\nAs easy as pie.\n\nAfter a vigorous four-minute entrance,\n\nit was clear that things were working out great.\n\nCheck this out!\n\nLook, there\'s so much I can,\n\nyou can see the whole UI.\n\nSo there is the problem of these screens.\n\nI spend a lot of time trying to make sure\n\nthat I had a cool-looking background.\n\nSuch is the curse of the green screen.\n\nThough you can put anything behind it,\n\nsometimes you are left with the void.\n\nI worked so hard to make sure\n\nthat my background expressed my gamerhood,\n\nand the gamer box just covered it up.\n\nI wanted to digitally recreate it,\n\nbut since I had three cameras it would have to be in 3D.\n\nSo I reached out to my coworker Jenna\n\nto mock something up in Blender for me,\n\nbased on some previous images I had of my gamer space.\n\nOkay, so we just got the new background set up.\n\nLet\'s get up in here!\n\nAlrighty, okay.\n\n(grunting) Okay!\n\nI can...\n\nShit.\n\n(groans) My shirt got caught on a thing.\n\nThis was a rude awakening, but a necessary one.\n\nMy current clothing setup was not compatible\n\nwith the gaming rig, so I figured out a new way\n\nto kill two birds with one stone.\n\nThe idea came from my compression braces.\n\nMy wrists felt so much better while compressed,\n\nand it made me wonder:\n\nWhat if all of me was compressed?\n\nSo I looked up those tactical black skin suits\n\nthat athletes wear in the Olympics,\n\nbut I was running dangerously low on time and money\n\nso I had to order from a less-than-scrupulous vendor.\n\nAnd when it finally arrived it was not to my specifications.\n\nI didn\'t have any more time.\n\nThe deadline was fast approaching.\n\nSo I dealt with what I had,\n\ncrawled into my sweltering gamer space and--\n\nI see what the problem is now.\n\nMy new compression suit was causing me\n\nto dissolve into Jenna\'s wonderful background.\n\nSo I asked her to remodel it,\n\nthis time with a 3D photorealistic virtual Brian\n\nthat I could superimpose my face onto.\n\nAnd the worst part of it was that--\n\nAnd I forgot my snacks!\n\nBut in all tribulations there is a chance for greatness,\n\nand greatness was found with a little inspiration,\n\na little heat exhaustion\n\nand the very last of my sponsorship money.\n\nI\'m covered head to toe in this important green screen,\n\nand I don\'t want this to get marred, obviously.\n\nSo what I\'ve come up with,\n\ninstead of having to eat toast with my hands,\n\nis that I\'ve purchased\n\na horse feedbag.\n\nAnd I was worried about, you know,\n\nmy hot milk is gonna start to cool down.\n\nAnd my computer right now is running a little bit hot, too.\n\nWhy don\'t I just kill two birds with one stone?\n\nThere are tons of liquid-cooled computers out there,\n\nand if I use this tubing, I can feed the cool milk\n\nthrough the PC, cooling it down perfectly,\n\nup around my headset, over the microphone.\n\nOkay, I got my feedbag, which will allow me to eat my snacks\n\nand then I\'ve got my warm milk, which is also\n\ngonna be cooling my computer in the box.\n\nI\'ll have my snacks and I\'ll have my box,\n\nand I can stay in there.\n\nWith the invention of the milk-cooled PC, patent pending,\n\nand the feedback-sustained me, patent pending,\n\nthe perfect gamer space was complete.\n\nOkay.\n\n(grunts) Hello!\n\nGamers.\n\nI have my feedbag, I tossed it over beforehand.\n\nThe crown of it all,\n\nmy milk-cooled PC.\n\n(Brian panting)\n\nLet\'s get gamin\'.\n\nThought the feedbag worked wonders,\n\nI was still doing poorly in my matches.\n\nI was getting flustered and couldn\'t focus,\n\nbut that\'s nothing a little warm milk couldn\'t help.\n\nCome on! (groans)\n\nSee, I don\'t get, oh, no no no no no, stop!\n\nNo no no, uh, shit!\n\nShit, shit!\n\nAh!\n\nOh, this is bad!\n\nThis is very bad!\n\nThis is very bad!\n\nAfter mopping up the MILK MSTR\'s lactose coolant fluid\n\nand toweling myself off,\n\nI broke out the gaming laptop I borrowed from work\n\nand sat back down in my original VALORANT test position.\n\nAnd I was better.\n\nWithout the lights and the monitors\n\nand the hands-free snacks,\n\nI was gaming better on a coffee table\n\nthan in my dedicated space.\n\nSo did I screw up\n\nand kill too many birds with too few stones?\n\nOr was I a less than perfect gamer?\n\nPerhaps I was asking a toddler to pilot a helicopter.\n\nThere\'s nothing wrong with\n\nmy hot cardboard box of gaming perfection.\n\nI simply was not ready to handle it responsibly.\n\nOne day, I will reenter that cocoon\n\nand emerge a wonderful gaming butterfly.\n\nBut before I grow my wings,\n\nthis little grub must learn to crawl.\n\nAnd also how to defuse the spike without dying.\n\nIt seems impossible.\n\nHas anyone done it yet?\n\nI doubt anyone\'s done that yet.\n\nThat\'s ridiculous.\n\n(cheery music)\n\nOh, I\'m so dumb.\n\nI screwed it in the wrong way.\n\n- [Karen] I didn\'t wanna say nothin\'.\n\n- You didn\'t wanna say nothin\'?\n\n- [Karen] Well, I looked at it and I knew.\n\n- You looked at it and you knew?\n\n- [Karen] Yeah. (laughs)\n\n- And you didn\'t say nothin\'?\n\nNo! ', ' Kingdom Hearts 3 is finally here.\n\nAnd I have received an excessive amount of requests to explain the storyline.\n\nThat seems perfectly reasonable.\n\nYou want to be caught up before you hop into the third game.\n\nBut judging by the wording on a few of these requests, it seems like I have a…\n\nTALL TASK\n\nahead of me.\n\nBut could I possibly help you understand the gargantuan, magnificent,\n\nepic storyline of Kingdom Hearts?\n\nYou sweet summer child.\n\nYou babe swaddled in the cashmere blanket of ignorance.\n\nYOU ASK TOO LITTLE OF ME.\n\nBecause not only can I help you understand Kingdom Hearts.\n\nBut I will give you the tools necessary to understand any story you are ever faced with\n\nfor the rest of your life.\n\n*music plays*\n\nPlease, oh baby, don’t go.\n\n~Simple and clean is the way that you\'re making me feel tonight.~\n\n*CLAP CLAP*\n\nSpoiler Warning!\n\nI’m about to explain the entirety of the Kingdom Hearts series.\n\nNow, if you don’t want to be spoiled for all of the games released up until now…\n\nI don’t know why you clicked on this video.\n\nBecause I feel like the title kinda explained that that’s what I was gonna do.\n\nSo that’s on you.\n\nUh, but ALSO.\n\nPotential spoiler warning!\n\nYou see, when I explain the tools of the literary trade, I might just be able to accurately\n\npredict the true ending of Kingdom Hearts 3.\n\nNow, the game hasn’t been released yet, and I have not played it, but…\n\nConsider yourself warned.\n\nWe’re talking about the hero’s journey or the monomyth.\n\nThis is a concept that’s been around for a long time.\n\nBut it was popularized by a guy named Joseph Campbell back in 1949 when he released a book\n\ncalled The Hero with a Thousand Faces.\n\nCampbell inspired plenty of other creative writers and literary analysts, including a\n\nguy called Christopher Vogler, who wrote his own book in the 1990s.\n\nBut before that, in the 1980s, he was working as a story consultant for a little company\n\ncalled Disney.\n\nWhen he was there, he sent out a seven-page memo that basically broke down all the big\n\nideas from Campbell’s book into 12 simple steps to writing good stories.\n\nDid the memo work?\n\nI don’t know.\n\nWhy don’t you ask Timon and Pumbaa?\n\nThey…\n\nThey’re from the Lion King.\n\nThat was a movie that Disney Produced.\n\nA lot of people think it’s a great movie.\n\nKingdom Hearts as described by the monomyth.\n\nWe’ve got 12 stages up here, kinda like a clock.\n\nIt’s a story wheel.\n\nAnd I’ll go through piece by piece explaining Kingdom Hearts 1, so that way you can understand\n\nwhat these stages are.\n\nOnce you do understand these stages, you’ll be able to understand any story!\n\nBecause great writers, no matter how dense their sci-fi or fantasy world may be, use\n\nthese stages to help orient you.\n\nI’m talking Dune.\n\nHarry Potter.\n\nSpace Jam.\n\nNumber one, introduction in the ordinary world.\n\nIn Kingdom Hearts 1, this is when Sora, Riku, and Kairi are all just hanging out on Destiny\n\nIslands, doing normal kid stuff.\n\nCall to adventure.\n\nWhat’s this?\n\nWeird creatures showing up on the island?\n\nSora has a sword that’s also a key?\n\nRefusal of the call.\n\nNow we hit a bit of a hiccup here because he really does seem gung-ho to leave the island\n\nat some point.\n\nBut I don’t think he wanted to do it on these terms, so I’ll still call this a refusal.\n\nMeeting with the mentor.\n\nAt this point Sora is in Traverse Town, and he meets Leon, who ends up giving him some\n\nguidance on what he’s supposed to be doing.\n\nCrossing the threshold.\n\nOr as true literary critics call it…\n\nboarding the gummi ship.\n\nTests, allies, and enemies.\n\nThis is pretty much the entirety of the Disney worlds.\n\nYou’ll notice that a lot of times in these synopses of Kingdom Hearts,\n\npeople just skip over them.\n\nIt’s cause they all fit here.\n\nReaching the innermost cave.\n\nThis is such a pivotal moment in the story.\n\nIn Star Wars, this is when Luke goes into the cave and faces off against a shadow version\n\nof himself.\n\nAnd in Kingdom Hearts, this is when Sora goes into Hollow Bastion so he can fight Riku, who is\n\nactually being possessed by Ansem, who is the Heartless version of Terra-Xehanort, who\n\nwas originally Terra but was then possessed by Xehanort before him.\n\nSame thing.\n\nEnduring the supreme ordeal.\n\nAfter Sora has faced off against Ansem the first time, he has to stab his own heart with\n\na keyblade, so that way he can release it and save Kairi.\n\nThat’s a supreme ordeal.\n\nSeizing the sword.\n\nNow this is not a literal sword.\n\nObviously, Sora already has one of those.\n\nBut instead it’s the reward or the power that Sora can take with him.\n\nSo in this case, it’s him being resurrected, having all of the princesses of heart saved,\n\nand having the power to defeat Ansem.\n\nThe road back.\n\nAnsem has been defeated by Kingdom Hearts being opened and him being ripped apart by\n\nthe light.\n\nAnd they are able to seal the doors, but unfortunately, they lose two of their friends in the process.\n\nResurrection.\n\nYeah, Sora did get literally resurrected a few stages before this.\n\nUh, but this is more of a metaphysical resurrection.\n\nThem finally coming back from the brink.\n\nKairi going back to Destiny Islands.\n\nReturn with the elixir.\n\nSora, Donald, and Goofy all go back out, using their combined experience to try to save Mickey\n\nand Riku.\n\nAnd that\'s Kingdom Hearts!\n\nThat was pretty painless, don\'t you think?\n\nBut granted, that\'s not what people have an issue with.\n\nPeople have an issue with all of the overarching story of Kingdom Hearts.\n\nBut, again, as long as we stick to these 12 stages, we should be able to take this apart,\n\npiece by piece.\n\nAnd though I am gonna stick with the 12 stages, I am gonna add just, uh, one little extra piece.\n\nIt\'s called historical background.\n\nThis is like The Silmarillion.\n\nOr JK Rowling\'s twitter.\n\nIn Kingdom Hearts, this would be Union Cross, or Chi, or whatever the many names of this\n\nweb/mobile game ended up being.\n\nDie-hard fans will get upset with me if I say this doesn\'t really matter to Sora\'s overarching story.\n\nBut I\'m gonna say it anyway.\n\nSo this historical background is gonna just be up here.\n\nAnd all of that knowledge is just gonna kind of bleed immediately into Kingdom Hearts 1.\n\nPat (offscreen): Uh, nope, you gotta do Birth by Sleep.\n\nPat: It\'s a prequel.\n\nBrian: But, is Sora in it?\n\nPat: No.\n\nNo Sora.\n\nBrian: Who\'s this guy, then?\n\nPat: That\'s Vanitas.\n\nBrian: Why?\n\nSo I, uh, seem to have neglected, uh, like three other heroes\' journeys in this hero\'s journey.\n\nSo I\'m just gonna...\n\nI\'m gonna move these over a little bit so that way I can have a bit more space.\n\nWe, we do have to talk about Birth by Sleep.\n\nStarting first with Terra\'s.\n\nUm, now imagine it has all twelve of the stages of the hero\'s journey, I just didn\'t want\n\nto write \'em all out, \'cause he gets norted, so he\'s not that good of a hero.\n\nSame goes for Aqua, which is intersecting with Terra\'s.\n\nAnd then we\'ve got Ventus, who has the biggest bearing on Sora\'s hero\'s journey.\n\nIt means that it has to not only intersect over here with Terra and Aqua.\n\nBut, I\'m sorry Vogler, I am gonna have to include another step on your hero\'s journey.\n\nSo here we\'ve got the Ventus Diagram, uh, which intersects here at step point five.\n\nThe part of the hero\'s journey, uh, where the baby hero\'s heart goes and saves another boy.\n\nThat\'s the only big change we\'re gonna do to Vogler\'s story wheel.\n\nUh, everything else is gonna make sense in Kingdom Hearts.\n\nAnd now we\'re going to take the wheel, uh, as if it is the overarching story of the entirety\n\nof the games.\n\nSo Kingdom Hearts, the first one, instead of going from 1 all the way to 12, is actually\n\njust gonna go from 0.5 to 5.\n\nAnd then we start 5 immediately at Kingdom Hearts 2, which will begin with Sora...\n\nPat (offscreen): Nope.\n\nBrian: What do you mean nope?\n\nPat: There\'s two more.\n\nOnce again I seem to have neglected a few, uh, interstitial pieces of Kingdom Hearts.\n\nChain of Memories and also three five eight days over two.\n\nWhich is a totally normal title.\n\nIt\'s totally fine, because it just fleshes out Sora\'s hero\'s journey.\n\nAnd also... a different guy and his name is Roxas.\n\n*pained expression*\n\nI went ahead and I categorized Chain of Memories as a "hero\'s journey redux"\n\nsince Sora is just fighting against his own memories, the things that he has remembered\n\nfrom the past hero\'s journey.\n\nSo it\'s just gonna hang out around here.\n\nAnd then we have 358/2 Days, which follows Roxas, who is Sora\'s Nobody.\n\nAnd a Nobody is like the shell of a person after they\'ve released their heart.\n\n358/2 Days happens then, and since it\'s the hero\'s Nobody, it\'s actually within the hero\'s\n\njourney, doing its own thing.\n\nUm, and, I\'m gonna call this 4.5 remix.\n\nThis is a pivotal part of the hero\'s journey when, uh, the hero\'s shadow self goes off\n\nand eats ice cream.\n\nThese two are tied together by a character named Xion, who works in Organization XIII\n\nwith Roxas, and also is made from the memories... of Sora.\n\nShe doesn\'t really have like a hero\'s journey...\n\nI\'ll just tie it out for you.\n\nAnd since this oblong actually crosses through the hero\'s journey twice, we\'re gonna make\n\nthis easy to remember and call it the\n\n"Hero\'s Memories of the Hero\'s Journey Double Cross Oblong."\n\nOr HMHJXXO.\n\nIn Kingdom Hearts 2, we start out with Roxas and Sora, and Roxas is on summer vacation.\n\nWe\'re gonna have him start over here and just kind of go all the way up to enduring the\n\nsupreme ordeal, where he finally gives up his body to Sora so Sora can be whole.\n\nAnd we\'re just gonna call that "The Antihero\'s Cradle."\n\nAlright, so, we\'re done with Roxas, we\'re back with Sora.\n\nSo this should be a breeze.\n\nKingdom Hearts 2.\n\nAlright, he\'s already crossed the threshold.\n\nHe does the tests, allies, and enemies.\n\nThat\'s just the Disney stuff, we\'re gonna skip it.\n\nHe goes over, reaches the innermost cave, that would be the World that Never Was, where\n\nhe faces off against the supreme ordeal.\n\nXemnas, Organization XIII.\n\nSeizes the sword.\n\nHe gets the power to close Kingdom Hearts.\n\nAnd then finally, the road back.\n\nThey get home.\n\nThey get a letter from King Mickey, the contents of which will be revealed in...\n\nKingdom Hearts 3?\n\nPat (offscreen): No.\n\nFUCK!\n\nALRIGHT ASSHOLES.\n\nI have no more space here, so I made you a DATA CUBE.\n\nARE YA HAPPY?\n\nThe data cube contains the entirety of Kingdom Hearts Coded, which is all in a virtual space.\n\nThe data cube is that thing where the hero goes on a journey into his inner thoughts\n\nand finds some data that an old guy put in him.\n\nIt\'s that THING THAT HAPPENS IN THE HERO\'S JOURNEY.\n\nAnd then at the same time, we also have Dream Drop Distance, which... is another hero\'s\n\njourney inside of the hero\'s journey, and it\'s part of seizing the sword.\n\nBecause they have to go... into sleeping versions of the world\'s they\'ve already been to.\n\nBut also maybe they\'re... they\'re going into each other\'s dreams?\n\nAnd one of them is...\n\nNo, it doesn\'t fit here, I\'ve got a better...\n\nThere\'s another part of the hero\'s journey, and it\'s called the Dream Drop Bucket.\n\nAnd it\'s where you put the Dream Drop Distance until you need it later, and hopefully you won\'t.\n\nThat brings us up to Kingdom Hearts 3.\n\nGranted, I thought when I started this, I would be able to...\n\nperfectly predict, uh, Kingdom Hearts 3.\n\nBut, I don\'t know, I feel like I"m just missing something.\n\n*CAUSE He GeTs NOrTEd.*\n\n*BeING POsESSed bY AnSEM.*\n\n*By XeHAnORT.*\n\n*CAUSE HE GETS NORTED.*\n\nI forgot about the villain\'s journey.\n\nThe villain\'s tridecagon.\n\nThe villain\'s tridecagon is definitely the key.\n\nThe tridecagon of villainy.\n\nThis is a 13-sided shape that goes one further than dodecagon of the hero\'s journey.\n\nWe have almost entirely ignored Xehanort.\n\nHe is the impetus for all of the anger and anguish in Sora\'s life.\n\nAnd so he deserves a wheel as well.\n\nWe have to start at the very beginning of Xehanort.\n\nAnd that starts in stage one of all villains.\n\nYou have to be contacted by a future version of yourself.\n\nThat brings us to stage two.\n\nIt gives you the ability to time travel.\n\nAnd that\'s what this means.\n\nThis special string just shows that they can go wherever they want to in time.\n\nStep three, you need to learn about a great power.\n\nThis is when Xehanort first discovers Kingdom Hearts and all of the power it could hold.\n\nWhat do you do after you find out about that power?\n\nYou nort a boy.\n\nOnce you\'ve got that boy under your possession, time to get real into unethical science.\n\nThat\'s when you\'re going to learn all about Kingdom Hearts and how to release people\'s hearts.\n\nThat means you can become a guinea pig yourself, therefore creating two versions of yourself.\n\nA Nobody and a Heartless.\n\nBut are you happy with just those two versions of yourself?\n\nYou shouldn\'t be!\n\n\'Cause you\'re a villain.\n\nThat\'s right, it\'s time for nort boy redux.\n\nStage eight.\n\nThis is when Ansem, the Heartless version of Terra-Xehanort, the original norted boy\n\nform, takes control of Riku.\n\nAnd now that you\'re jazzed and ready to go, time to fail.\n\nYou do have to fail once, uh, in order to succeed later as a villain.\n\nBut don\'t let that failure get you down, it\'s time for stage 10.\n\nYou develop an organization to trick young boy into committing Heartless genocide in order to create\n\na new pseudo version of that great power you discovered back in stage three.\n\nAnd then you fail again.\n\nBut guess what!\n\nIt\'s time travel time.\n\nYour young self is gonna help you out by coming from over in step two to step 12.\n\nYou just do the same tenth step again, except instead of using other people, you use 13\n\nversions of your own self.\n\nWhich leads us to the thirteenth point in the tridecagon.\n\nThe villain\'s variable.\n\nYou\'re either gonna win, or you\'re gonna lose.\n\nThis is the thing that we were missing.\n\nThe villain\'s variable is what will tie together the rest of story.\n\nIt\'s what will help us understand what will happen in Kingdom Hearts 3.\n\nAnd judging by the villain\'s tridecagon, I can say that I don\'t believe Sora will seal\n\naway the darkness.\n\nIn fact I expect Xehanort to win...\n\nby norting Sora.\n\nAnd then think of the repercussions of this.\n\nDonald will kill Goofy by throwing him off a dock.\n\nRiku will start cutting his own bangs.\n\nKairi will continue to not matter.\n\nIt\'s so much more interesting.\n\nIt\'s the true way that this story should end.\n\nAnd I think this is what people want.\n\nThis is the modern hero\'s journey.\n\nThe true thing that all stories should follow from here on out.\n\nAs Utada Hikaru would say: Simple and clean.\n\nSo the next time someone tells you, "I don\'t understand Kingdom Hearts!"\n\nYou say, "Hey Bucko.\n\nI think what you don\'t understand is basic storytelling."\n\nBasic storytelling.\n\nDid that work?\n\nI don\'t know.\n\nAsk...\n\nAladdin.\n\nDid the memo work?\n\nWhy don\'t you ask Sebastian the crab. *sings Under the Sea*\n\nYou nort a boy.\n\n*laughing*\n\nPat (offscreen): Ohhh no. ', ' *cheerful music*\n\nKirby!\n\nThis pink puffball has been sucking his way through the denizens of Dream Land since 1992.\n\nHe has his own games, manga, tv series, and toys.\n\nIt’s safe to say he’s one of Nintendo’s most trusted mascots.\n\nBut he should not be trusted.\n\nThe problem with Kirby is that he is simultaneously Nintendo’s simplest and most powerful creature.\n\nThose two realities cannot coexist.\n\nHe is a life form with neither the ambition nor the intelligence to make decisions,\n\nand yet the world bends to his will.\n\nAlthough it appears that Kirby is just a vacuous pastel marshmallow,\n\nthere must be some hidden wisdom that grants him the power he wields.\n\nThere has to be.\n\nKirby’s incongruity is terrifying,\n\nbut that’s only because we are terrified of things we do not yet understand.\n\nAnd today, we are going to understand.\n\n"Scientia potentia est.” Knowledge is Power.\n\nHumankind’s attempts to harness the powers of the natural world\n\ncome from intense research and understanding of those powers.\n\nAnd yet Kirby is granted powers well beyond his station.\n\nWhat powers, you ask? Allow me to show you.\n\nI have created two columns here: Simplicity, and Power.\n\nWhat Kirby is, versus What Kirby can do.\n\nBy mapping the dichotomy of these two columns, we can peel back the facade of Kirby’s simplicity,\n\nand figure out what’s really going on.\n\nBecause, again, this is not normal.\n\nLet’s begin with simplicity.\n\nMost people know Kirby as that cute little round guy, but is there more to him?\n\nAccording to official, canonical information:\n\nno.\n\nDoes this sound like an apex predator?\n\nEven a bear enjoys a satisfying back-scratch.\n\nThis sounds like the lowest form of life,\n\nsomeone who is stuck on the base of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs.\n\nHe wakes up, eats his caloric intake for the day,\n\nand falls asleep watching The Great British Bake Off.\n\nAnd yet, over here on the power column...\n\nThe things Kirby eats are completely obliterated.\n\nNot just converted into something else, completely gone.\n\nKirby only cares about eating and sleeping.\n\nAnd yet, he gains no energy nor pleasure from consuming these things.\n\nInstead, he just lets them disappear.\n\nGone from this plane of existence.\n\nSo…\n\nwhat the fuck.\n\nKirby doesn’t speak a language beyond saying the words “Poyo,”\n\nand “Hi!”\n\nKirby mostly communicates via body language and grunts.\n\nEven toddlers are more communicative.\n\nBy all accounts, he is either incapable of, or uninterested in, speaking language.\n\nAnd yet Kirby is an incredibly skilled technician.\n\nWe see Kirby piloting mechs, and if anime is to believed,\n\nand I believe anime,\n\nthis can only be accomplished by gifted teens grappling with psychosexual ennui.\n\nHe can effortlessly turn himself into a fighter jet,\n\nsomething that only the most skilled air force engineers have mastered.\n\nHow can he understand these complex mechanical processes,\n\nwithout having the language skill to read a textbook\n\nor the "I fucking love science" facebook page?\n\nKirby’s origins are vague.\n\nLet me take a moment to move over to a different board so I can show you Kirby’s origin story.\n\nThere’s NOTHING HERE.\n\nVery little is known about Kirby’s origin.\n\nHe has no canonical species. He has no canonical age.\n\nMasahiro Sakurai, Kirby’s alleged creator,\n\nhas stated he does not remember how Kirby got his name.\n\nKirby was originally a placeholder sprite,\n\nset to be replaced by something....\n\nMore!\n\nBut no. Kirby survived. Kirby came from nothing.\n\nAnd Kirby is nothing.\n\nOr is he everything.\n\nBecause Kirby can be anything.\n\nHis copy ability gives him the powers and appearance of any creature he consumes.\n\nBut copy is a misnomer.\n\nHe does not duplicate his enemies.\n\nHe assimilates and replaces them.\n\nIn Smash, he takes the power of his foes, and then the foe is released as a sign of respect.\n\nBut in every other iteration of Kirby, the thing he consumes is destroyed in the process.\n\nDoes he absorb their DNA? Does he absorb their memories?\n\nIs he the keeper of their souls?\n\nAll of these abilities point to Kirby being intelligently designed, which we know is not the case.\n\nSakurai fucking woke up in a crop circle with the name “Kirby” carved into his arm.\n\nKirby has no emotional intelligence. No relationships.\n\nIn the anime, Kirby seems to harbor no ill will toward King Dedede or Escargoon,\n\nhis main two antagonists.\n\nHe faces baby birds and full battalions of soldiers with the same vacant grin.\n\nHe eats and destroys indiscriminately, but counts no one among his enemies.\n\nBut those who count him among theirs…\n\nare cosmic horrors.\n\nLook at this thing.\n\nLook at this thing!\n\nThese celestial powers probably have wants and needs far beyond our human comprehension,\n\nand yet they trouble themselves with the destruction of Kirby,\n\na barely living kickball.\n\nWhat do they see in Kirby that scares them?\n\nWhat could scare this?\n\nAnd the final simple evidence, Kirby is shaped like a friend.\n\nThis was the opening of Kirby’s Adventure. Let me show you something.\n\nWhat did you notice?\n\nThat’s right. For the entire time I was drawing this,\n\nI WASN’T INTERROGATING the true nature of Kirby.\n\nThis quote is cute and simple and a blatant misdirection.\n\nIt is a patronizing errand is meant to keep people like me from uncovering the truth.\n\nThe truth that Kirby possesses infinite power.\n\nAnd that is a quote.\n\nPlanet Robobot explicitly states that Kirby possesses infinite power.\n\nKirby can ride a star. Kirby can punch through a planet.\n\nKirby is the only being in the entirety of the universe that survived the Galeem cataclysm.\n\nA circle survived.\n\nTHIS SURVIVED.\n\nHOW?\n\n*deep breath*\n\nNow that we’ve addressed these two columns, it is time to bridge the gap.\n\nHow can we reconcile the two canonical truths of Kirby:\n\nthat he is both nothing and everything.\n\nHow can this sentient garbage bag accomplish so much?\n\nLet me tell you...\n\nI don’t know.\n\nI literally have no clue how this dumb fucking orb can have so much power.\n\nI have worked my whole life researching and gaining knowledge,\n\nand this dipshit sphere sleeps all day and has powers that gods fear.\n\nAnd that’s impossible.\n\nIt should be impossible.\n\nThere has to be an answer here and I don’t see it and that’s NOT FAIR.\n\nIf knowledge is power, then power should be knowledge,\n\nand Kirby is everything and he should know everything,\n\nand yet we know nothing!\n\nI can’t think in here.\n\nI’m going outside!\n\nHow do I get outside?\n\nKirby!\n\nThe mystery of this florid Dream Landian has baffled me,\n\nbut I\'ve taken a few months, and I\'ve collected my thoughts,\n\nand I’m back in the studio to deliver my findings.\n\nKirby’s incongruity is terrifying, but that’s only because we are terrified of things we do not yet understand.\n\nAnd today, for real,\n\nwe are going to understand.\n\nIf you’ll recall from our first exploration of the rosy nightmare,\n\nthe problem with Kirby is that he is both incredibly simple and incredibly powerful.\n\nIn the intervening five months, I’ve learned a few pieces of information that contradict a few of my points.\n\nFirst, Kirby can speak a language.\n\nThere was a Drama CD released in Japan in 1994 where Kirby speaks full sentences.\n\nBut in this, he says that a phone is “mysterious” and he doesn’t know how it works.\n\nAnd yet, he can pilot a mech.\n\nTwo, Kirby’s name does in fact have a backstory,\n\neven if Sakurai was too fuckin\' zooted to remember it.\n\nKirby was named after John Kirby, a lawyer who passed away last year,\n\nwho defended Nintendo’s right to copyright Donkey Kong back in the ‘80s.\n\nBut this doesn’t make the rest of Kirby\'s origin any less vague,\n\nand it doesn\'t change the fact that a creature cannot possibly embody both of these truths.\n\nBut that’s the problem.\n\nI’ve been thinking of Kirby as a creature.\n\nConsider, for a moment, Moby Dick.\n\nYou might receive this book in your English class and say,\n\n"Hell yeah! A big ol’ whale?\n\nI can’t wait to see Ahab level up and hit that big boy right in his weak points.\n\nAnd sure, he puts his harpoon up in Moby D’s flanks,\n\nbut spoiler alert!\n\nAhab gets got,\n\neven though he’s been grinding for, like, years\n\nand Pale Whale\'s just a dipshit fish with a thing for sailor feet.\n\nAnd so you say this to Ms. Mahoney and she’s like,\n\n“Brian, don’t you get it? The whale is a metaphor for…\n\nsomething,”\n\nand then you write that on your final exam and you pass the class.\n\nThis is what I like to call “The Bookman’s Bluff.”\n\nIt’s when an author creates something, and people are like,\n\n“Hey, that doesn’t make sense,”\n\nbut then the author says,\n\n“Well, it does make sense if you consider it’s actually a metaphor.”\n\nHere, I believe that Sakurai is pulling a Bookman’s Bluff.\n\nKirby, like Moby Dick, doesn’t make sense as a creature,\n\nbut he will make sense as a metaphor.\n\nSo what does Kirby symbolize?\n\nLet’s take a look at some common metaphors.\n\nLet\'s start with the seven deadly sins since everyone and their mother is basing characters on them.\n\nUnfortunately, none of them really make sense for Kirby.\n\nWrath, no way. Greed, he’s not in it for the money.\n\nI\'m gonna skip over lust.\n\nYou could make an argument for Gluttony because he eats a lot.\n\nSloth, he sleeps a lot. And Envy, he\'s constantly copying other people.\n\nBut he never does it with any malice. Kirby does these things haphazardly,\n\nwithout any sense of what he\'s doing.\n\nAnd then there’s Pride.\n\nNow, pride is the sin from which all other sins arise,\n\nand its punishment in hell is being broken upon the wheel,\n\nbut Kirby is a wheel, so that ain’t gonna work.\n\nBut Kirby might symbolize someone else’s pride...\n\nThe Hubris of Humanity.\n\nThink about it.\n\nHas humanity ever paused to consider that perhaps our endless consumption\n\nmay not be a good move for the world as a whole?\n\nHave we altered our course or simply continued to eat and sleep and copy others\n\nwithout any thought of the repercussions?\n\nIn fact, perhaps we can go one step further. Kirby is a metaphor for capitalism!\n\nDoes our capitalist society assimilate and destroy?\n\nAbsolutely!\n\nTechnical and cultural appropriation are two of capitalism’s most trusted tools.\n\nWhen it comes to a lack of emotional intelligence,\n\ncapitalism makes people willing to suck in and obliterate anything,\n\nfriend or foe, nation or natural wonder, so long as it makes money.\n\nIs capitalism’s enemy a cosmic horror?\n\nWhat could be more cosmically horrifying to a capitalist society\n\nthan a guy called Marx.\n\nKIRBY IS A METAPHOR FOR CAPITALISM.\n\nSure, capitalism can sometimes be more cruel in its intentions than Kirby can manage.\n\nThat is... I\'ll take that.\n\nUh, also, it sure as hell feels like it could burn out at any second,\n\nso the infinite power thing: not 100% true.\n\nUm, and,\n\nvery-it\'s a-it’s hard to describe capitalism as being shaped like a friend…\n\nand the whole eating and sleeping only is...\n\nit doesn’t really make sense \'cause we have a hyper fixation on productivity and that being tied to worth…\n\nso that doesn\'t...\n\nThis is not a very good metaphor, is it?\n\nIn fact, most of these metaphors are bullshit.\n\nEspecially this one.\n\nI thought I could take five months and pause and contemplate,\n\nand then I\'d come back, and I\'d have the perfect explanation for the dichotomy of Kirby,\n\nbut nothing has changed.\n\nThis horrifying bolus slips through my fingers again.\n\nMaybe I’m just not good at this...\n\nJenna, can you...\n\nI need you to keep my papers and push pins safe. I’m gonna go away for awhile…\n\nI\'m gonna find Kirby.\n\nJenna: Okay. Good luck bud.\n\nI went to the woods because I wished to front only the essential facts of Kirby.\n\nI wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life,\n\njust as Kirby might suck a Waddle Dee into his gullet.\n\nI’ve been at it for a while now.\n\nJudging by the length of my beard, I’ve been living out here for 2, maybe 3 years?\n\nThere are no pin boards in the forest.\n\nI don’t have three cameras to catch my every side glance.\n\nThey don\'t teach you th...\n\nIt’s just me. And nature,\n\nwhich has reduced me to my base instincts.\n\nI only care about finding food and shelter,\n\neating and sleeping.\n\nI am become Kirby.\n\nI wish I could say this has given me a clear mind, but no,\n\nnature has broken me.\n\nI am confounded by it.\n\nAnd we are terrified of things we do not yet understand.\n\nKirby is nature!\n\n...I thought, after spending my first day out in the woods.\n\nSure, nature’s origins are still murky,\n\nand what is evolution if not a really, really slow form of Kirby’s copy ability?\n\n*inhaling*\n\nAnd much like Kirby, Nature is neither cruel nor kind:\n\nit doles out boons and punishments indiscriminately.\n\nFor every delicious handful of berries,\n\nit also gives a completely unrelated bout of diarrhea.\n\nBut it took me only a few days to realize that this was another dead end.\n\nNature doesn’t destroy matter, or possess infinite power,\n\nand its enemy is not a cosmic horror,\n\nit’s us.\n\nI\'m sorry for using so much paper.\n\nSo I went back to the proverbial drawing board and have been stuck there ever since.\n\nNature is still terrifying to me.\n\nAnd it is certainly not shaped like a friend.\n\nHow can Kirby live like this and stay so joyful?\n\nHow can he only care about his base needs and conquer any enemies that come before him?\n\nI can’t conquer anything,\n\nnot even the mystery of a character from a children’s game.\n\nAll I can do is tumble listlessly through the wood,\n\nlike a star spat from Kirby’s maw.\n\n*waves crashing*\n\nI awake one morning upon the shore of a strange sea.\n\nI do not know where I am, nor how I came to be here.\n\nThe sea stretches endlessly in front of me,\n\nrevealing the gentle, Kirby-like curve of the planet,\n\nand I finally understand.\n\nI was so focused on investigating the inner machinations of this bulbous boy\n\nthat I never asked why I was investigating.\n\nI am tormented with an everlasting itch for things to mean something,\n\nbut Kirby didn’t need an explanation,\n\nI did.\n\nThere is no bullet point or fan wiki entry.\n\nKirby is not nature or a metaphor.\n\nKirby doesn’t need a dark backstory or a logical rationale.\n\nKirby is just Kirby.\n\nAs I stand here watching the waves lap against the sand\n\nmiles away from civilization,\n\nI realize I’m not simply standing on the edge of the ocean, but the edge of the world.\n\nA world I’ve accepted without knowing its hidden meaning.\n\nPerhaps there is no hidden meaning.\n\nPerhaps it’s better that way.\n\nPerhaps it’s time for me to go home.\n\n“First you draw a circle,\n\nthen you dot the eyes.\n\nAdd a great big smile,\n\nand presto, it’s Kirby.”\n\nKirby is an extremely strong circle,\n\nand that’s all the explanation I need.\n\nUnfortunately,\n\nthe same CANNOT BE SAID FOR DIDDY KONG.\n\nWHO GAVE HIM A GUN? DID HE BUILD THE JETPACK?\n\nTHAT DOESN\'T MAKE ANY SENSE, HE\'S A MONKEY, WHAT IS HE...\n\n*suit ripping* Ahhh yeah!\n\nThis is satisfying. If you get in on this, you want to...\n\nPat: Yeah.\n\nBrian: Roll... just put that in a bunch of dirt right now.\n\nI\'m gonna roll around a little bit.\n\n*you hear a bunch of scrounging around*\n\n*shirt ripping* Brian: Ohhhh incredible!\n\nPat: Are we gonna ride on the train like this to Coney Island?\n\nBrian: Yeah maybe! ', " Mario!\n\nHe can jump, he can dance,\n\nand he can successfully avoid conviction for war crimes.\n\nIt seems like the only thing he can’t do is settle down and just enjoy life for a bit.\n\nMario has been cleaning up messes in the Mushroom Kingdom and beyond since 1981.\n\nThat makes him almost 40 years old.\n\nMost 40-year-olds I know are paying off a mortgage, buying a Peloton,\n\nand desperately trying not to become their parents.\n\nBut Mario is still out there,\n\ngrinding at the same job,\n\nand also, every other job.\n\nDoesn’t Mario deserve some time off?\n\nDoesn’t he get a chance to kick up his heels?\n\nEnjoy a tropical drink while visiting the ol’ timeshare?\n\nAnd more specifically, hasn’t he made enough coins to let him coast for the rest of his life?\n\nThat’s why I’m here to give him a little financial advice…\n\n*ding!*\n\nAnd figure out when Mario can retire.\n\n*chalk board wheeling in*\n\nThank you both.\n\nWhy should Mario retire?\n\nYou might say “Mario loves his job,\n\nand when you love what you do, you never work a day in your life,”\n\nbut that's bullshit.\n\nI love what I do, and let me tell you something…\n\nI’ve worked some days.\n\n*threatening bass noise*\n\nI personally can’t wait to retire.\n\nAs soon as I hit 50, I'm gonna be out there on the beach,\n\npina colada in one hand, sci-fi novel in the other,\n\nsoaking up mother nature's cosmic rays.\n\nBut Mario has a history of risk-taking behavior, and\n\nit's possible he's planning to live fast, die young, and leave a beautiful, beautiful corpse.\n\nThat said, he’s made it out of every scrape so far,\n\nand ground pounding at age 86 is hard on the hips.\n\nMario needs a backup plan.\n\nNow, I’m not here to tell Mario how to live his life\n\n*ding*\n\nbut I can take a look at his finances\n\nand figure out when he’ll have enough money to finally hand Peach his resignation letter.\n\nFoolish ol’ me thought that I could just google “how much money do you need to retire”\n\nand there'd be a link that says “a million bucks,”\n\nbut no.\n\nTurns out that everyone needs a different amount to retire based on what you’re used to.\n\nIf you’re making millions every year, you’re gonna need a lot more to retire,\n\nbecause how else are you gonna support your dipshit failson’s bad business ideas?\n\nBut with all of the retirement calculators online, I was getting a little overwhelmed,\n\nso I decided to reach out to a qualified financial advisor.\n\n- Hi, my name’s Nate Choe, I’m a certified financial planner with Northwestern Mutual,\n\nand I basically help people answer questions about money.\n\n- That’s exactly what I need you to do today.\n\nThis call is not about me, um, I feel like I’m in a great spot right now in terms of my finances,\n\nbut I have some worries about my good friend, Mario.\n\nI was looking online to see if there was, like, just a number of money you need in order to retire,\n\nand it turns out that that’s not a thing that exists.\n\nHow do I figure out how much money you need to retire?\n\n- Yeah, yeah, um, there are a lot of different things that you’d need to know.\n\nAt the most basic level, you need to know how many years you’re going to spend in retirement.\n\nSo basically, when you’re gonna retire, and at what age you’re going to die.\n\n- So I have know, I have to be able to, uh,\n\nto just discern when I’m willing to croak, is what you’re saying.\n\n- Exactly, yes, you have to calculate a death at some point.\n\n- Alright. What if I’m never gonna die.\n\n- *chuckling* Then you’re never going to be able to retire.\n\nAnd then you’ll need to know how much money you’re going to spend every single month…\n\n- Okay…\n\n- And then Nate listed off a bunch of other very important pieces of retirement info\n\nand I paid close attention.\n\n- Got it, okay.\n\nI figure out how much money he’s gonna need per month, and then I’ll work backward from that,\n\nbased on how much money he can accrue, and then that will be how I can figure out when he can retire?\n\n- That work backwards model is actually what we do in the industry,\n\nbut we have to offset what he has against inflation as well.\n\n- Is there a minimum amount of money per month that you suggest people have for retirement?\n\n- Yeah, typically, what we’re talking about, like, the average American,\n\nit’s going to be about three thousand dollars a month, of today’s dollars.\n\n- I feel like Mario is a very humble man,\n\nand so I don’t think he’s going to need more than 3k a month, um,\n\njust to make it easier for me.\n\nSo now that I’ve got a basic gist of the information I need to calculate Mario’s retirement age,\n\nit’s time to collect the information.\n\nLet’s start with something easygoing\n\nand figure out when Mario's gonna die.\n\nTo keep things simple, we’ll assume that Mario was born the year he first made a game appearance.\n\nThis might not be perfectly accurate, but it would make him almost 39 years old,\n\nand that feels pretty right for a strangely smooth-skinned mustachioed man.\n\nThough current male life expectancy is around 80 years old,\n\nI personally can’t come to grips with the fact that Mario is halfway through his life,\n\nso I’ll be generous and say he’ll die at 90.\n\nHe’s spry.\n\nIn order to retire, Mario is going to need a monthly budget of at least three thousand US dollars,\n\nbut he uses coins.\n\nTons and tons of people have tried to figure out, how much a coin would be worth in US dollars,\n\nbut most of them have been thinking about coins as a solid gold object.\n\nJudging by the amount of coins you need to purchase simple objects in the Mushroom Kingdom,\n\nit seems like coins are not really worth that much.\n\nUsing Super Mario RPG as our guideline for a coin’s purchasing power,\n\nthe cheapest items are a mushroom and able juice: 4 coins a pop.\n\nShirt and pants are the cheapest nonconsumable items at 7 coins each.\n\nI wanted to compare these with the most expensive items in Super Mario RPG,\n\nbut I don’t think I can figure out the real world price of a fire bomb\n\nwithout getting put on a watch list.\n\nAfter doing some heavy research, I settled on a conversion rate of 1 coin to 8 US Dollars.\n\nGiven our 3k figure for retirement,\n\nthat just means Mario needs 375 coins a month, right?\n\nWRONG.\n\nSuper Mario RPG came out in 1996, and we haven’t accounted for inflation.\n\nThat’s why we gotta compare these prices to similar items Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga,\n\nwhich came out seven years later.\n\nI built my Mushroom Price Index on these six items, and just from a cursory glance,\n\nit’s obvious that the prices have gone up.\n\nBut to figure out by how much, we gotta head back to algebra two.\n\nThe pert equation!\n\nIt's something I learned about a very long time ago,\n\nand I’m pretty sure it’s used to figure out compounding interest.\n\nBasically, I gotta plug in some prices and do some natural logs and\n\nwhatever else the internet tells me to do,\n\nand it will leave me with an annual inflation rate for that item.\n\nThen I just gotta average out the rates and it’ll leave me with a workable annual inflation rate\n\nfor the Mushroom Kingdom as a whole.\n\nSo I’ll just go ahead and do that math in my head real quick.\n\n*thinking music*\n\nThank you, Clayton.\n\nNow, rounding that number up, that’s an average annual inflation rate of about 15% per year.\n\nWhich is… really high.\n\nThe US Federal Reserve tries to keep inflation at a healthy 2%,\n\nwhereas the Mushroom Kingdom Federal Reserve doesn’t exist\n\ndue to aggressive lobbying by Wario.\n\nIn order to understand this a bit better, I googled Mario hyperinflation,\n\nand I got some exciting search results\n\nthat were ultimately unhelpful.\n\nBut from what I gather, this means that if Mario spends 100 coins to buy a shirt this year,\n\nnext year, he'll have to spend a little more than 115 for the same shirt.\n\nIf inflation stayed the same from when Superstar Saga came out in 2003,\n\nwe can assume that by 2020, a simple mushroom is going to cost 128 coins.\n\nA pair of entry level pants will cost 2049 coins.\n\nSo that original 1-to-8 conversion rate doesn’t really make sense anymore.\n\nUsing those same 2020 price comparisons,\n\nthe conversion rate is more like 36 coins to 1 US Dollar.\n\nIf Mario retired today, he would need 108,000 coins per month.\n\n*MAMMA MIA!*\n\nBut let’s remember that Mario has been doing this for a long time. He’s definitely got a little something...\n\n... away. So I talked to Nate about his job and ways he might be saving money.\n\n- He has a bit of a strange job. He’s technically a plumber, I guess, in title?\n\n- Is he part of, like, the plumber’s union? Does he have a pension?\n\n- So I, I, I would be willing to bet he doesn’t have a pension just because, uh,\n\nI think he might be the only plumber?\n\nHe’s not being employed by anyone, necessarily. He’s just doing it and then finding his payment along the way.\n\n- Okay, so it sounds like he’s almost, like, a freelancer.\n\nIf he’s not getting W-2 income he can’t save into things like 401ks or Roth IRAs.\n\n- Now, when you say Roth IRA, what is that?\n\n- It’s a way to save for retirement.\n\nUm,\n\nyou know, as a young person you should definitely be doing one, trying to max it out every single year.\n\nIt’s crucial for, for retirement.\n\n- When…\n\nBut when you say crucial, do you…\n\ndo you mean optional?\n\nSo, maybe Mario doesn’t have a Rough IRA or a 4-in-1 Cake or whatever,\n\nbut no one has those. I don’t, and I’m well on my way to that beach chair in Boca!\n\nAnd the fact is that Mario can get a lot of coins in his games.\n\nHow else could he spend so much on go-karting and tennis?\n\nIn the most recent Mario games, the coin counter can only go up to 9,999,\n\nwhich is the maximum amount you can store in a mattress.\n\nSo let’s assume that Mario has been saving 10,000 coins every year since the release of Mario Odyssey.\n\nWe can assume that since he’s not in a union, he isn’t getting any raises to offset inflation.\n\nSo to finally figure out when Mario can retire, we need to know much money he’ll need every year before his death.\n\nFor example, if he lives to 90 years old, he’ll need 2.7 billion coins.\n\nWhich is the cost of living for just one year.\n\nBut we have to remember that he's been saving 10,000 coins for 54 years,\n\nwhich means that he would have 540 thousand coins saved up… Which is…\n\npoint zero two percent\n\nof what he needs to retire for just one year before his death.\n\nAnd actually, if the monthly cost of living is already 108 thousand coins,\n\nhe's gonna be unbelievably deep in debt…\n\nWhich is actually what Nate told me, via text.\n\nMario can never retire.\n\nYou know what, that’s bonkers though, because there's...\n\nthere’s no way that, you know, inflation's gonna stay that high for that long.\n\nIn fact, in later Mario and Luigi RPGs, the prices are the same or lower.\n\nSo let’s just assume that from here on out the inflation rate stays a healthy 2%.\n\nAnd you know what, let’s assume that Mario can save more than 10,000 coins a month.\n\nIn New Super Mario Bros. 2, the counter maxes out at one less than 10 million coins.\n\nGranted, this is an outlier, and a ridiculous one at that,\n\nbut so is spending 2.7 billion coins just to survive at age 90.\n\nThere’s no way you could spend that much on Werther’s Originals.\n\nSo let’s say he's saving 10 million coins a year since age 31,\n\nwhich, might I point out, is over a quarter of a million US Dollars.\n\nNow if we just add up the cost of living of each year leading up to 90,\n\nwe can see that Mario will have saved enough money to chill out on his boat at age…\n\n77.\n\nWhich is...\n\nis just one year below the average American male life expectancy…\n\n*I'M-A TIRED!*\n\nOkay, you know what,\n\njust for fun, let's just throw some random numbers in here, just to... just for...\n\njust to see, you know, just wheaa- just for fun!\n\nLet’s say Mario is starting to save money at, ppffff, I don’t know, my age, 26.\n\nThe inflation rate can stay the same, 2%,\n\nand let's just say that the coin ratio is actually just 1-to-1 with US dollars,\n\nso just he needs 3,000 coins today in order to retire.\n\nAnd, and you know what, let’s, let's say he can save….\n\nuhhh, psshhh, 10% of an average video producer’s salary in New York City.\n\nSomething completely random like that.\n\nAssuming Mario lives to the ripe old age of 90,\n\nwe can just plug these figures into the equation\n\nand figure out that Mario will be kickin' back on the white sands,\n\nboombox blastin' Jimmy Buffett at the youthful retirement age of...\n\n88?\n\nAre you fucking kidding me?\n\nNononono... That can’t be right…\n\nBecause if Mario can’t retire,\n\nthen that would mean that I wo-\n\n*uncomfortable silence*\n\nWill you excuse me for a moment…\n\n*tropical music playing in the background*\n\n*Another day in paradise!*\n\n*The sun is shining bright!*\n\n*People laugh and people smile, 'cause everything feels alright!*\n\nIn order to understand this a little better, I googled Mario hyperinfla- *laughing* I just,\n\nI'm sorry, I'm just accepting this now. I'm just accepting what I'm saying. ", ' The Mega Man robot masters were not always evil.\n\nIn fact, most were mechanized workers, created specifically to make life on Earth more efficient\n\nand wonderful.\n\nAND THEN THAT MASSIVE DONGER,\n\nDR. WILY, TURNED ‘EM ON US!\n\nSo Mega Man destroyed them, and the world was saved.\n\nBut... just how useful were these robots?\n\nAnd were they useful enough to chance a robot uprising?\n\nWhat if someone ranked every single Mega Man robot master from most to least useful to\n\nsee which ones were really worth the risk.\n\nSomeone should try to do that.\n\nIt’s me.\n\nI’m the one who’s going to do that.\n\nBefore I get started on the gradient of worth it to not worth it, I’m gonna talk\n\nabout the protagonists, or “the good guys” even though some of them aren’t specifically good.\n\nA lot of these robots were built to be sentient for the sake of being sentient, and I do not\n\nfeel at all qualified to discuss the philosophical implications of that.\n\nSo I’m gonna put ‘em over here.\n\nMega Man.\n\nMega Man X.\n\nMega Man red.\n\nThey’re all over here.\n\nI’m not gonna touch that.\n\nSo what kind of robots are good when they’re sentient?\n\nI think that it’s things humans cannot do.\n\nThings that perhaps only a robot could do.\n\nOne that can think for itself would be pretty worthwhile.\n\nSo let’s start with those ones.\n\nThe ones that are good.\n\nNumber one: Chill Man.\n\nChill Man is a recent robot master who was built to help stop global warming.\n\nAnd heaven knows we need that.\n\nDefinitely worthwhile.\n\nNext is another cold friend: Freeze Man.\n\nFreeze Man was built to make a non-polluting energy.\n\nHe would make that energy by splitting average temperatures\n\ninto hot temperatures and cold temperatures.\n\nI’m choosing to think of that as something like nuclear fission as opposed to choosing\n\nto think of it as dumb.\n\nCommando Man.\n\nTerrible name, but he was actually a minesweeping robot.\n\nOne of the first gens, Elec Man.\n\nHe controlled nuclear power plants.\n\nHe could help make sure the nuclear power plant was shut down in case anything bad ever\n\nhappened to one.\n\nHopefully it won’t!\n\nSsssssSTAR MAN!\n\nHe was built to explore the universe.\n\nHumans are real squishy, really, when you think about it.\n\nIt might be nice to have a man going out into the stars, a Star Man.\n\nAlso in his flavor text, he’s apparently a romantic and, like, loves poetry, and that’s\n\nwhat we need out in the stars.\n\nWhile he’s up there, Galaxy Man is helping figure out the trajectories.\n\nSplash Woman!\n\nShe’s super useful because she goes and helps shipwrecked sailors, or just people\n\nlost at sea.\n\nI feel like she’d do a better job than, I dunno, the Coast Guard or whatever.\n\nNot that I’m shitting on the Coast Guard.\n\nThey do do good…\n\nI’m digging myself in a hole.\n\nWait, where’d Toad Man go?\n\n*worry about Toad Man*\n\nWhere’s my guy Toad Man?\n\nToad Man.\n\nHe irrigates crops during drought.\n\nVery useful.\n\nWhy’d they make him a toad?\n\nIce Man.\n\nI swear we’ve got a lot of cold people up here at the front.\n\nHe’s built specifically to do human-like tasks in cold weather.\n\nSo he’s good!\n\nMore cold friends.\n\nBlizzard Man.\n\nThere to help monitor the weather in arctic environments.\n\nLooks and names can be deceiving, and Junk Man is super important.\n\nJunk Man was built so he could find useable robot parts that have been left out.\n\nThink about how much electronic waste we make.\n\nIt would be great if something could go dig through all of our trash and find the useable\n\ncircuit boards.\n\nThat’s important.\n\nHornet Man.\n\nWe’ve done some shit to bees y’all.\n\nHe pollinates the flowers.\n\nWould be very useful if we continue to keep doing shit to bees.\n\nAnd finally, we’ve got Cloud Man and Tornado Man.\n\nThey both are actually useful for, uh, controlling the weather when things are bad.\n\nI’m gonna put Cloud Man in front of Tornado Man because Tornado Man, uh, was, was built\n\nto stop tropical storms.\n\nWhich is not what a tornado is.\n\nHe needs a different name.\n\nThere we go.\n\nThese ones I would say are worth the risk.\n\nWe still have like 180 more to go.\n\nWe got a bunch of construction robots next.\n\nWe’ll start with everyone’s favorite: Guts Man.\n\nImagine there’s a line right here.\n\nMaybe I’ll put it in in after effects.\n\nThat might be too much work.\n\nI’m probably not gonna do that.\n\nGood ones.\n\nNow we’re into construction zone.\n\nGuts Man comes first because he’s a civil engineer.\n\nHe’s not only strong and can lift big rocks, but he can build bridges probably.\n\nWe’ve got Aqua Man and Pump Man.\n\nBoth of them are used for water filtration.\n\nI’m gonna put Aqua Man in front of Pump Man because Pump Man’s flavor text explains\n\nthat sometimes he’ll volunteer to wash off graffiti,\n\nand no one likes a narc.\n\nBomb Man: bombs.\n\nGround Man: excavation.\n\nBlock Man: makes blocks.\n\nConcrete Man: concrete.\n\nNeedle Man: needles.\n\nI guess it’s drilling.\n\nDrill Man: also drilling.\n\nBit Man, from the DOS game.\n\nHe is also a driller.\n\nYou think that after the first two went bad… they would’ve stopped making drill robots,\n\nright?\n\nOil Man DOS.\n\nHe does oil… things.\n\nHard Man.\n\n*trying to keep it together*\n\nHe doesn’t actually have a, um, flavor text explanation for what he is other than that\n\nhe is very heavy.\n\nSo I am assuming that he is for ground leveling.\n\nUm.\n\nBut maybe he’s just big?\n\nImpact Man: piling.\n\nCut Man: tree cutting.\n\nTorch Man DOS: welding.\n\nFuse Man: electrical equipment management.\n\nOil Man: keeping things oiled.\n\nSpark Man: making sparks!\n\nI think he actually charges things.\n\nFire Man.\n\nHe was made to incinerate trash.\n\nBond Man.\n\nHe was supposed to be in the first game until they realized… he was just glue.\n\nStone Man.\n\nI assume bricks, but actually they only say that he hangs out with Guts Man, so maybe\n\nhe’s just moral support.\n\nFlame Man.\n\nHe generates thermal power.\n\nBut also he’s powered by thermal power?\n\nWhich seems recursive.\n\nAnd also impossible.\n\nJewel Man.\n\nHe not only mines the jewels but he polishes them.\n\nFinally, in the construction, it’s Slash Man.\n\nHe was specifically made to cut down trees so that you could build SECRET bases.\n\nI don’t know why they insisted on saying it was for secret bases.\n\nThat seems like a waste of a robot.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I don’t think we needed to make these ones sentient, because\n\nyou know what, Hard Man?\n\nI think steamrollers were doing just fine.\n\nNow we’re getting into a category I like to call…\n\nSure???\n\nThey’re not necessarily bad.\n\nI just think we could probably do without Wind Man, who apparently helps with the harvest…\n\nwith fans.\n\nAstro Man, who just works in a planetarium.\n\nGravity Man.\n\nHe can control gravity which could be useful?\n\nDive Man.\n\nHe was built to catch fish with torpedoes.\n\nThey made him look like a submarine and they gave him torpedoes.\n\nFeel like they should’ve seen this coming.\n\nSolar Man.\n\nNow he investigates solar things, I guess.\n\nHe also apparently developed an exercise routine.\n\nI don’t know why they needed to put that in the flavor text, but it definitely put\n\nhim in the “Sure???” category.\n\nTop Man.\n\nI’ll give ya…\n\nI’ll give you a guess about what he does.\n\nDid you guess “explore other planets?”\n\nBecause yeah, that’s what he was designed for.\n\nWhy the FUCK is he a top?\n\nGod these are all so good.\n\nWe’re getting into the categories where I can’t stop laugh…\n\n*clears throat* *deep breath*\n\nSerious.\n\nSnake Man.\n\n*laughter from everyone in the studio*\n\nHe, uh, was supposed to explore other planets\n\nthat had crevasses.\n\nAnd he’s a snake.\n\nGyro Man.\n\nHe was supposed to be a really good plane, but then Wily ran out of money, so they just\n\nstuck a propellor on his back.\n\nPlant Man manages plants.\n\nPharaoh Man.\n\nOnly supposed to explore ruins.\n\nBlast Man.\n\nHe manages fireworks.\n\nFireworks are dangerous.\n\nDon’t play with fireworks.\n\nBut also, maybe, don’t make a robot to play with them.\n\nI love Nitro Man.\n\nI’m gonna be honest, I do feel kind of bad putting him into the “Sure???” category.\n\nUh, because Nitro Man was built specifically to do motorcycle stunts in movies.\n\nThe thing I really love about Nitro Man is that he’s the president of a stunt robot club.\n\nWhich I think is just wonderful.\n\nHe’s still not useful.\n\nHere’s where thing get a little bit difficult for me.\n\nBurst Man was built to be a guard.\n\nI’m not sure about robot, highly armed guards.\n\nBut since he was specifically a guard…\n\nI keep saying specifically.\n\nI figure, like, that’s still defensive, and so…\n\nI’ll put him here.\n\nBut it’s a good segue!\n\nIn the Mega Man games, not every robot was made by Dr. Wily or Dr. Light.\n\nAnd in fact, there were some robots that were made by other robots.\n\nOr were made extraterrestrially.\n\nOr were made specifically as a joke, like “I can’t find my keys, man!”\n\nI’m gonna put them kind of as the split in the middle to say, “Hey, these are nebulous,\n\nbut they’re definitely not good.”\n\nNow that we’ve got this hard line of good to bad, even though, to be honest, I think\n\nthat the line should be here.\n\nIt’s time for us to talk about the bad robots.\n\nJ.J. Abrams.\n\nSome of these robots were built specifically to murder.\n\nWe can all agree that that is bad.\n\nI’m gonna put all of these murder robots over on the very bad side.\n\nWe also have a bunch of characters that are Sonic robots.\n\nThat is an affront to nature.\n\nThey’re in the bad side, too.\n\nI also didn’t even print out all of the NetNavis from Mega Man Battle Network even\n\nthough I love those games because those were software built with the specific intention\n\nof being mean online.\n\nAnd that’s just Twitter.\n\nI do just want to point out Aircon Man, who was a robot sent from the future to destroy\n\nthe world.\n\nAnd he’s also an air conditioning unit.\n\nNow *kick* let’s get into the fun part.\n\nThese robots have absolutely no reason to be sentient.\n\nChemistry Man.\n\nHe’s from the new cartoon.\n\nHe apparently taught chemistry classes that were so boring, he put kids to sleep.\n\nAnd then he took it really personally, and decided to become evil.\n\nSheep Man.\n\nHe’s a shepard actually.\n\nTundra Man.\n\nBuilt to do similar things to all of the high echelon frozen people, but I’m including\n\nhim over here because he got really bored at his job and then decided to become\n\nan ice skater.\n\nThis is why you don’t make sentient robots, I guess.\n\nHypno Woman.\n\nShe was a therapist who hypnotized people into bad things.\n\nDJ Jazzy J4-8950…\n\nis a boombox.\n\nYou are a magnet.\n\nPlug Man charged electrical things.\n\nLike a plug could do.\n\nStrike Man sounds cool, but he’s just a baseball throwing machine.\n\nIt’s me.\n\nSpring Man can… jump?\n\nBright Man.\n\nBuilt to explore dark places.\n\nKinda like a FLASHLIGHT.\n\nCold Man’s a refrigerator.\n\nSeriously.\n\nSword Man.\n\nHe was developed to hold a sword that Wily stole from a place.\n\nHe’s not a sentient murder robot.\n\nHe’s a sentient picture frame.\n\nThings that don’t really need to be sentient?\n\nA vacuum.\n\nIt’s Dust Man.\n\nAlthough, Dust Man is quoted as saying, “Don’t let me suck more than I can handle!”\n\nSo you know what, actually, I take this back.\n\nHe’s more important than Chill Man.\n\nWe’ve already done the worthwhile ones.\n\nWe’ve talked about the construction ones.\n\nWe’ve talked about the ones that are “eh whaat uh sure w-okay thas fine.”\n\nWe have all of the ones that are alien.\n\nAnd we’ve got the ones that really didn’t need to be sentient.\n\nWe are left with the dregs of robotic society.\n\nI call this category…\n\nNO.\n\nWe’ll start with Crystal Man.\n\nHe was built to make crystals so that Dr. Wily could sell them for money.\n\nTurbo Man is a car.\n\nOr rather, he used to be a car, but then he was turned into turbo man.\n\nCharge Man.\n\nIs he a train?\n\nNo.\n\nBut he’s meant to camouflage as one.\n\nI think Dr. Wily’s just real into trains.\n\nYou know what I think about when I think of “Safety Operations Manager?”\n\nA big man full of magma.\n\nBuilt to make sure a plant kept safe, but also had a bunch of cauldrons full of boiling\n\nmagma in him.\n\nTime Man.\n\nHe’s a time machine.\n\nThat never goes well.\n\nAcid Man was built to be a chemist.\n\nWhat’s he good for, titrations?\n\nThat\'s a chemistry joke.\n\nCentaur Man.\n\nHe... was a tour guide.\n\nJust hire a 16 year old.\n\nLike, they need the job.\n\nShark Man DOS.\n\nShark Man DOS not need to exist.\n\nOh we’ve been doing this for like five hours.\n\n*CLAP CLAP*\n\nGoddamnit.\n\nMagic Man was built to be a magician in like a traveling circus sort of show.\n\nAnd then he was not turned evil, he just decided to conscript in King’s army because he wanted\n\nto show off.\n\nHere’s the big rule of thumb:\n\nmagicians are always evil.\n\nShade Man.\n\nHe looks like a vampire, doesn’t he?\n\nIt’s ‘cause he was built to look like one.\n\nHe was an animatronic robot in a haunted house.\n\nSomebody thought we should make that creepy animatronic robot sentient.\n\nPHEW remember how Centaur Man was a tour guide?\n\nWell so was Dynamo Man.\n\nBut they also made him constantly shoot off electricity.\n\nThat’s a bad tour guide.\n\nWhen they got into, like, the late game stages, they were just like, “I dunno, he’s a\n\ntour guide for a thing.”\n\nTorch Man was built to teach kids about fire safety in the woods.\n\nWhich is kind of like if Smokey the Bear\n\nwas CONSTANTLY ON FIRE.\n\nYou thought torch man was bad, let me tell ya about Burner Man, who was made, and I quote,\n\n“to bring harm to natural environments.”\n\nTechnically not murder.\n\nDefinitely bad.\n\nRemember how I said that a lot of these guys were tour guides?\n\nWell let me tell you about Blade Man.\n\nBuilt to show off an old castle full of swords.\n\nAnd also was a sword.\n\nTengu Man.\n\nMakes typhoons.\n\nHOOOKAY.\n\nWe’re at the final three here.\n\nWe’ve made it.\n\nAnd I’d say that these three really hammer home the point\n\nthat we should not be making sentient robots.\n\nWe’ve got Pirate Man.\n\nNot a murder robot.\n\nBut was built to do pirate things, like steal from other ships.\n\nHe does look cool as hell, though.\n\nThe second to last robot is not actually a terrible robot idea.\n\nBut it is a testament to just how trash human beings are.\n\nBounce Man was built to be a crash test dummy.\n\nSome asshole thought, “Hey, you know that thing we throw against a wall,\n\nmany miles-per-hour,\n\nevery single day,\n\nmultiple times a day?\n\nYou know what would make that better?\n\nIF IT COULD FEEL PAIN.”\n\nWHAT?\n\nLuckily, Bounce Man bounced from that job and then became an exercise instructor.\n\nHumans are trash.\n\nFinally, we’ve come to number one.\n\nClown Man.\n\nWho has ever watched a clown and thought to themselves,\n\n“Boy,\n\nI wish that thing never got tired!"\n\nClown Man is terrible, and I’m not saying that clowns are terrible.\n\nOkay?\n\nClowns serve their purpose.\n\nThey’re creepy.\n\nSometimes good.\n\nAnd…\n\nYou know what, I do take that back, clowns don’t serve a purpose.\n\nThat’s it.\n\nAll 200+ Mega Man robot masters, of which 15 are kind of okay.\n\nElon Musk: don’t get any ideas.\n\nThis is what man has wrought.\n\nYou will see these men in your nightmares.\n\nParticularly,\n\nSpring Man.\n\nJumping around.\n\nMake sure to like this video and subscribe to Polygon.\n\nAnd maybe leave a comment about what I should take care of next.\n\nBecause this… was bad. ', " Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.\n\nA game that takes heroic and villainous characters and forces them to form fraternal bonds in\n\nthe crucible of battle.\n\nBecause for those who can superbly smash, there is no better place to make a friend\n\nthan on the battlefield.\n\nThat’s the battlefield?\n\nSeriously?\n\nHow did they get permits for that?\n\nThat’s irresponsible.\n\nHi, I’m Brian David Gilbert, safety fan and bureaucratic wunderkind, please address\n\nme as such, and I’ve spent the last week and a half poring over the regulations of\n\nthe United States Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration,\n\nalso known as OSHA.\n\nI’m here to hold Super Smash Bros. to account.\n\nBecause when you take 70-plus beloved characters and force them to fight for our entertainment,\n\nthe least you can do is make sure the buildings are up to code.\n\nSo let's go ahead and FIND EVERY OSHA VIOLATION IN EVERY STAGE IN SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE.\n\nFirst, let’s explain the process, we have to start by choosing the correct regulations,\n\nand unfortunately, there isn’t a OSHA guide to “bloodsport,” so we're just gonna go\n\nwith construction, form 1926. 'Cause that's close enough.\n\nThe main thing to point out here is 1926.10 subsection A. I’ll read an excerpt for you\n\nso you can understand the basic concept of this video, and also the hellscape I had to slog through\n\nthe past week: “no contractor or subcontractor contracting for any part of the contract work”\n\n— that’s a real line — “shall require any laborer or mechanic employed in the performance\n\nof the contract to work in surroundings or under working conditions which are unsanitary,\n\nhazardous, or dangerous.”\n\nBasically, we’re here to build a safer experience for these characters, because when you walk\n\ninto an unknown space, I want the first question on your mind to be:\n\nThere are roughly 350 regulations in form 1926.\n\nHow many pages is that?\n\nAbout 684.\n\nDon’t worry, this is... this is just a visual aid.\n\nThey're all blank.\n\nI wouldn't waste paper like that.\n\n*thinks of the times he's wasted paper*\n\nMost of these regulations are irrelevant, but I\n\nstill had to read all 684 pages in order to know which ones to cut.\n\nWhich reminds me, this video idea came from commenter nshady16, so if you have an Unraveled\n\nidea, why don't you go ahead and leave me a comment.\n\nAnd thanks, nshady16, for making me read 684 pages of OSHA regulations,\n\nyou piece of garbage.\n\nSo I cut out all of the regulations that were just definitions, unrelated to stages, nonmandatory,\n\nredundant, or about personnel safety, because again, we’re not talking about hard hats,\n\nwe're talking about the stages themselves.\n\nUnfortunately, this also meant I had to cut out the entirety of subsection R.\n\nSteel Erection.\n\nSo there goes like 80% of the jokes in this video.\n\nOut of those 350 regulations, we’re left with 46 that actually relate to Smash Bros. stages.\n\nAnd again, we're just using the 103 stages you get when you boot up Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.\n\nAny any secret stages that pop up later, uh, that's probably just an underground fighting\n\nring, which is a different form of illegality.\n\nI’m gonna explain all of these OSHA violations as we go along.\n\nBut I just want you to keep in mind that there is a maximum penalty of $12,934 per OSHA violation.\n\nWe’ll get into that later.\n\nLet's get these OSHA violations on the board.\n\nBAM!\n\nThat's all the OSHA regulations we'll be discussing today.\n\nLet's start with the codes that pretty much every stage violates.\n\nGeneral safety and health provisions.\n\nI threw these three here because they're just dangerous in general and they don't have that\n\nmany other specific violations.\n\nSafety training and education.\n\nSeems like most of these people don't have safety training.\n\nEspecially in Moray Towers, where they literally shoot guns at you as you fly into the stage.\n\nRecording and reporting of injuries.\n\nWii Fit Studio is a gym, and so I would expect it to have paperwork if one of the gym members\n\ngets injured.\n\nUnfortunately, all of the gym members get injured.\n\nMeans of egress.\n\nIn most places, you have to have exit signs.\n\nAnd also, you have to have exits that don't involve plummeting to your death.\n\nEmployee emergency action plans.\n\nIt's very important to have an emergency action plan.\n\nEspecially if that emergency action plan is for if a mountaintop breaks off and slides\n\ninto the ocean.\n\nLook at this polar bear!\n\nHe has no fuckin' clue what's going on!\n\nAccident prevention, signs, and tags.\n\nJust put one wet floor sign anywhere, and I'll let it slide, okay?\n\nDuty to have fall protection.\n\nI mean uh... there's no fall protection.\n\nHow hard is it to put a harness on someone?\n\nGeneral requirements for stairways and ladders.\n\nAnything above 19 inches of elevation needs a staircase or a ladder.\n\nNot everyone can double jump.\n\nSanitation.\n\nMost of sanitation deals with potable versus non-potable water.\n\nBut a lot of it also deals with toilets, and I have yet to find a Smash Bros. stage that\n\nincludes a restroom.\n\nAnd I need to know where Donkey Kong pees.\n\nSo those ones pretty much everyone gets wrong.\n\nWhich means that we're at about 900 violations already.\n\nYikes!\n\nI feel a bit bad hitting all of these stages so hard, so I'll be a bit lenient for 1926.50.\n\nMedical services and first aid.\n\nYou have to provide first aid if someone has been hurt.\n\nAnd I'll just let the max tomato fulfill that requirement.\n\n451 states that you can't be using unstable objects as scaff.\n\nI'm gonna call all of these scaff 'cause there's no OSHA guideline for levitating floors.\n\nJumping on an awning causes it to break in Onett.\n\nThat's totally irresponsible.\n\n452 states that you need to have cross bracing.\n\nKongo Falls has so many things that aren't cross braced.\n\n453 is all about aerial lifts.\n\nYou need to stand firmly on the ground while it is moving.\n\nStop jumping!\n\nHousekeeping.\n\nYou gotta clean out the debris.\n\nI don't care that you've got a big dog running around behind you... put the... put the blocks\n\naway, that's debris!\n\nPut your toys away, honey!\n\nOccupational noise exposure.\n\nI'm ignoring the fact that they're fighting on top of a jet and instead thinking about\n\nhow loud those jets are.\n\nPop some earplugs in!\n\nGases, vapors, fumes, dusts, and mists.\n\nAll of these stages have clouds that you can stand on.\n\nWhich means they're incredibly dense.\n\nI don't care what it's made of, you shouldn't be breathing that in.\n\nIllumination.\n\nThose torches don't do anything.\n\nI'm gonna trip and stub my toe.\n\nVentilation.\n\nA lot of these stages need more airflow, better ventilation, but in Pictochat 2, there is\n\ntoo much ventilation in the form of this man who blows air.\n\nWho hired this man?\n\nI don't want him on my job site.\n\nHazardous waste operations and emergency response.\n\nIn Flat Zone X, someone spills oil and then just leaves it there.\n\n1926.150, 151, 152, and 154 are all about fire protection.\n\nMost of these regulations are pretty self explanatory.\n\nYou need to have a fire extinguisher.\n\nIt needs to be readily available.\n\nYou can't have ignition hazards hanging around.\n\nYou can't store more than 25 gallons of a flammable liquid in one place.\n\nBy the way, I'm including magma as a flammable liquid.\n\nI know they mean petroleum substances, but I think that's just a lack of imagination\n\non OSHA's part.\n\nBut 154 is all about temporary heating devices and how they shouldn't be kept in enclosed spaces.\n\nKind of like the charmander at the top of Saffron City.\n\nThe general requirements of electrical equipment.\n\nThey should be kept free from hazards that could cause death or harm to employees.\n\nThe large airships flying around you in these stages are not only electrical equipment,\n\nbut they are designed to harm and kill you.\n\nViolation.\n\nSpecific purpose equipment and installations.\n\nThis is all about elevators and escalators.\n\nWarioWare Inc. is one big elevator.\n\nYou don't need me to tell you it's broken.\n\nHelicopters.\n\nIs a Shy Guy a helicopter?\n\nI think so.\n\nYou're not supposed to be working underneath hovering craft.\n\nEven if they're bringing you fruit.\n\nConveyors.\n\nThat includes the stages that move back and forth and also all of the scrolling stages,\n\nwhich are the fastest way to die in Super Smash Bros. Tools and material shall be secured\n\nto prevent movement.\n\nDon't move equipment unless it's safe.\n\nThey're on a live racetrack.\n\nAll of the things are moving.\n\nMarine operations and equipment.\n\nYou have to have a lifering on a barge, and you have to provide a walkway between wharfs\n\nand boats.\n\nPaper Mario dissolves into a boat, but that doesn't count as a walkway.\n\nAnd there is not a single lifering at the Donkey Kong residence.\n\nI don't care how good you are at surfing, FUNKY KONG.\n\nUnderground construction.\n\nIf you're working underground, you're required to have a five-person rescue team on call.\n\nAnd although Super Smash Bros.\n\nUltimate does allow up to eight players.\n\nNone of them will save you.\n\nWorking on or near exposed energized parts.\n\nDoes a pokemon count as an energized circuit?\n\nAccording to OSHA, yes.\n\n1926.1052 is all about stairways.\n\nIf you have a stairway that rises more than 40 inches, you need to have a handrail.\n\nI imagine that Mario is about 40 inches tall, and this is at least four or five times his height.\n\nViolation.\n\nViolation.\n\nVIOLATION.\n\nVIOLATION!\n\nConfined spaces.\n\nThese are places where you are building where it's hard to get in and out of.\n\nYou need to specify the acceptable entry conditions.\n\nThere are no acceptable entry conditions into a space with a pit full of acid.\n\nDisposal of waste materials.\n\nIf you are dropping waste materials more than 25 feet, you need to be putting it in a chute.\n\nClock Tower: it is all debris that is falling infinitely.\n\nAnd it SHOULD be in a chute.\n\n850 is about preparing the demolition building.\n\nYou're supposed to remove any glass that could break.\n\nAnd in Dracula's Castle, Death flies through the window and breaks the glass.\n\nI couldn't give a shit about Death, you should've removed that stained glass first.\n\n853, you can't have a aggregate of more than 25% of a floor destroyed, and in Find Mii,\n\nhe destroys half of the stage.\n\nThe manual removal of floors.\n\nYou can destroy a lot of things in Shadow Moses Island, but you shouldn't be standing\n\nunder them.\n\nTower cranes.\n\nThere is only one stage that violates this.\n\nIt's literally the only stage with a tower crane, and ya FUCKED IT UP!\n\nExplosives should be stored in a magazine when they're not in use.\n\nAnd in Wrecking Crew, they're just available for you to punch until they explode.\n\nFiring the blast.\n\nYou shouldn't be in the proximity of the blast.\n\nNor should you be in the barrel that is causing the blast and shooting you off into space.\n\n1926.53 and 54 are about different types of radiation.\n\nIonizing, which is nuclear, and non-ionizing, which is like lasers.\n\nFinal Destination is just flying around through random parts of space.\n\nThere is no protection.\n\nYou should be less worried about getting punched into oblivion and more worried about the cancers.\n\nIn Gamer, your mom fires lasers at you when she sees you gaming.\n\nI'm not here to discuss her qualifications, but you are not allowed to fire those lasers\n\nat employees.\n\nJUST LET ME GAME, MOM!\n\nLadders.\n\nSuzaku Castle?\n\nYou thought you could get away with that shitty-ass ladder?\n\nThose ladder rungs need to be uniform.\n\nThey need to be evenly spaced.\n\nThey need to not be broken.\n\nI know that ladder is there for aesthetic purposes, but THAT IS A VIOLATION, SUZAKU\n\nCASTLE.\n\nYOU CANNOT HIDE YOUR LADDERS FROM ME.\n\nThat leaves us with one stage.\n\nThe one that has violated the most regulations.\n\nBut I want to point out Boxing Ring.\n\nThe only stage that is OSHA compliant.\n\nIt's almost as if it was built to allow people to fight in it safely.\n\nSakurai, I know you worked so hard on this game, and I appreciate it so much, but you\n\ncould have stopped at just one stage.\n\nYou SHOULD have STOPPED at JUST ONE STAGE.\n\nFinally, weighing in at 23 OSHA violations, it's 75m.\n\nI'm not 100% sure if this had so many violations just because it is a construction site, so\n\nit was easier for me to find all of the flaws with it.\n\nObviously, Brinstar is probably more dangerous, but I don't know how to categorize Mother Brain.\n\nThe thing that pushed it over the edge was material hoists, personnel hoists, and elevators.\n\nThey need to be enclosed at all times.\n\nPeople can just jump on and off of these material hoists over there.\n\nThat's so irresponsible.\n\nThere's fire.\n\nThere are jacks that get thrown across the stage.\n\nThere is a large ape.\n\nAgain, I could not categorize that, but I know he shouldn't of been there! 75m is the\n\nmost OSHA violating stage in Smash Bros.\n\nAnd if you have to get rid of one of them, that's the one you should get rid of first,\n\nand then you should get rid of the rest of them, too.\n\nBecause, again, OSHA does not stop after one stage.\n\nLet's remember back to the beginning of this video when I talked about violation penalties.\n\nI mentioned that every serious violation of OSHA is $12,934 in fines.\n\nI forgot to mention that every repeated or willful violation is $129,336 per violation.\n\nI am going to pretend that I found all of these violations on the same day, and that\n\nthey didn't have a chance to fix them all, so therefore they are not repeated.\n\nBut that's still 1,317 violations.\n\nOr $17,034,078 in fines.\n\nWhich is why I am sending you this video, Masahiro Sakurai.\n\nSurely you can't afford 17 million dollars in fines.\n\nI'm willing to let bygones be bygones.\n\nOSHA doesn't need to hear about all of this evidence I've compiled.\n\nAll you must do is send me 50 US dollars.\n\nI'm in a real tough situation right now and I just need to get through the month.\n\nPlease.\n\nAlso you could send me Kirby's phone number.\n\nI know he is real.\n\nWhere are you hiding him?\n\nAnd I have yet to see a Super Smash Bros. stage that includes a toilet.\n\nAnd I need to see where Donkey Kong pees.\n\n*Pat & Brian laughing* And I need to know where Donkey Kong Pees.\n\nOh god I was so close!\n\nAnd I need to know where Donkey Kong peeHHSHSS.\n\n*through laughter* sorry this is... *breathe in* AHHHH ", " *cheerful music, slowly diminishing*\n\nIs life quantifiable?\n\nEvery breath, every beat of a heart...\n\nDo they count as tallies etched tirelessly into the stone of our existence,\n\nuntil one day, that stone is returned to dust?\n\nIs there a number, an algorithm, underlying the spark of life?\n\nAnd if given the chance to know the arcane secrets of that algorithm,\n\nwould you use that power for good?\n\nOr would you use it to calculate your pet’s HP?\n\nBecause that’s what I would do!\n\n*energetic music*\n\nHIT POINTS!\n\nWhat are they and how did they become the standard unit of life in nearly every game?\n\nIt all started with war games, tabletop games that involve a lot of little miniature military\n\nforces fighting on a battlefield.\n\nBack in the 1920s, the Naval War College created an early form of this in order to help evaluate\n\nbattles before actually fighting them.\n\nThey had a stat called “Life” which was determined by how many\n\n14-inch shell hits a vessel could take.\n\nSo that’s what a hit point is, how many 14-inch shells it would take to kill you.\n\nEvery living creature is one hit point.\n\nThe end.\n\nBut that isn’t our current understanding of HP.\n\nThat came when war games shrank in scope and started to become more fantasy oriented.\n\nIn older games, you would roll dice, and then your troops would either survive or they would die.\n\nYou had large swaths of nameless troops so you could do this without feeling any remorse\n\nover their deaths.\n\nHaha.\n\nWar.\n\nBut when these games stopped playing with hundreds of troops and instead focused on\n\na few main characters, players realized they didn’t want their characters to die!\n\nSo the hit point was born.\n\nYour character could survive X number of bad rolls before throwing them in the garbage.\n\nSo really, the hit point wasn’t made to quantify how easy something is to kill,\n\nit was born from compassion and wanting to see your characters grow and thrive.\n\nAnd then also to figure out how easy they were to kill.\n\nWe’ve had some semblance of HP for nearly a century, but we haven’t updated our real-world\n\nunderstanding of what one hit point looks like.\n\nSo I’ll be doing that, specifically so you can quantify your pet’s HP.\n\nA little disclaimer up front:\n\nI am not giving you this algorithm so you can battle your pets.\n\nAnimal abuse is wrong.\n\nAnd if you needed me to tell you that...\n\nI’m glad I told you that.\n\nI'm also not teaching you how to calculate human HP, because that power is too great to wield,\n\nand it could easily be used for evil by some of the most wicked forces on Earth...\n\nlike health insurance companies.\n\nNo, I am teaching you how to calculate your pet’s HP as a fun bonding exercise between\n\nyou and your animal, or in case you happen to be at a house party where you don’t know\n\nanyone but the hosts have a dog and so instead of just sitting in the corner pretending to\n\ntext people, you can spend your time calculating that dog's HP, which is a way more normal\n\nthing to do in a social situation.\n\nNow it is time for the research.\n\nHow are we going to effectively calculate ANY pet’s HP?\n\nLuckily, there are plenty of games that cover pretty much every type of pet that you could\n\npossibly have, but I’ll be using Pokemon as the main pet HP analog because it is literally\n\nabout having lots and lots of pets that you can love and cherish\n\nand I’m ignoring all the other stuff.\n\nAnd that brings us to our first criteria: Type.\n\nAccording to the National Pet Owners Survey, here are the most common types of pets found\n\nin U.S. Households.\n\nI appreciate that they have included a category called “Small Animals,”\n\nas if that means fucking anything.\n\nSo we're changing some things.\n\nThe standards are still there: Dog, Cat, Fish (and all aquatic creatures), Reptile, Bird,\n\nEquine, Small animal is becoming small mammal for things like ferrets and rabbits.\n\nWe're also including bug, because I love bugs!\n\nAnd if you have bugs in your house and you make the conscious decision to WANT those bugs in your house,\n\nthey aren't pests,\n\nthey're pets...s.\n\nAmphibian for the frog people.\n\nFarm animals covers any livestock that don’t immediately fit into the other categories.\n\nOriginally, I thought about classifying these quadrupedal animals as different sorts of dog.\n\nChunky dog, milky dog, horny dog.\n\nBut farm animal encompasses them a little bit better.\n\nI am still keeping those names, though.\n\nWe also have a category I call “exotic,” which encompasses all of the animals you see\n\nin instagram influencer pics that make you say,\n\nThis can go from monkeys to bats to hyenas, which, according to this incredibly reliable\n\nwebsite, I could technically own in New York due to a loophole?\n\n*about to make a terrible decision*\n\nAlso, Millennials and Gen Z often live in tiny, “no pet” apartments and\n\ndon’t get paid enough to support a decent standard of living for themselves, let alone\n\na pet, so they’ll often turn to plants in order to feel the joy that comes from nurturing\n\na living thing in our rapidly decaying ecosystem.\n\n*sigh*\n\nSo I’m extending pet status to plants so that way you too can do this HP calculation,\n\nbecause, god, we all need a distraction sometimes.\n\nBy building a set of pet types, we are able to assign HP RANGES to each of them by finding\n\nthe lowest base HP and highest max HP of each type.\n\nThe absolute extremes of this scale are Shedinja, with a base HP of 1, and Wailord, with a max HP of 544.\n\nNow, both of these would be pretty wild to have as pets,\n\nconsidering one is the shell left behind after a cicada molts,\n\nand the other is a fucking whale.\n\nBut that’s why they’re the extremes, and that’s why we are not done with our equation yet.\n\nWe might know the full HP range of a dog, but what is the HP range of YOUR dog.\n\nI thought for a moment about having size be the next criteria, because you might think\n\nthat the larger the animal, the more HP it would have.\n\nBut that’s actually not true!\n\nIn fact, the Pokemon with the highest base HP is Blissey, this strange little egg woman.\n\nAnd Onix, an enormous rock snake, has one of the lowest base HPs of all Pokemon.\n\nThis confused me, so I had to go back to the original popularizer of HP: Dungeons & Dragons.\n\nAnd it was there that I realized what truly affects your HP value:\n\nYour value is not defined by the size or shape of your body,\n\nit’s about what you do with the body you’re given.\n\n*cheesy motivational music*\n\nIt’s all about class!\n\nAs in, what standard gaming class does your pet fall into?\n\nEvery class has different HP ranges based on what they are expected to do.\n\nBarbarians are out in the front lines, so they tend to have a lot more HP than a rogue,\n\nwho is slinking around in the back.\n\nI’ve decided that the classes that make the most sense for pets are: Barbarian, Ranger,\n\nPaladin, Cleric, and Rogue.\n\nI haven’t included any classes like sorcerer, because if you have a magical pet,\n\nwhat are you doing here?\n\nGo cast spells with your turtle.\n\nThese class distinctions separate your pet’s HP range into 10 equal portions.\n\nIf your pet is a rogue, you get the first six.\n\nIf your pet is a barbarian, you're anywhere from five to 10.\n\nYour pet’s personality will determine what class they fall into.\n\nYour pet is a rogue if they are rakish, mischievous, and spry.\n\nCats tend to come to mind for the rogue category, simply because they’re always up in shit\n\nthey should not be up in.\n\nYour pet is a cleric if they are kind, reserved, and healing.\n\nA rabbit that hops onto your lap after a rough day of work and makes you forget all your\n\nworries is 100% cleric.\n\nYour pet is a paladin if it is loyal, resourceful, and, honestly, tries a little bit too hard.\n\nDoes your zucchini plant produce too many zucchinis?\n\nA.K.A.\n\nAny amount of zucchinis?\n\nIt's a paladin.\n\nYour pet is a ranger if they are self-sufficient, aloof, and kind of do their own thing.\n\nAsk yourself, am I holding my pet rat back from their true ambitions?\n\nThe answer is always yes, and your rat is a ranger.\n\nAnd finally your pet is a barbarian if they are boorish, brazen, and courageous to a fault.\n\nDoes your dog dig under the fence so it can jump into your neighbor’s pool?\n\nYour dog is Marmaduke.\n\nIt is also a Barbarian.\n\nYour pet can have a combination of many of these traits, but it’s up to you to decide\n\nwhich traits are most dominant.\n\nNow that we have your pet’s type and class designated, we need to get into the nitty\n\ngritty of their exact HP, which means finding your pet's level.\n\nIn order to do this, you must observe your pet in a scientific manner.\n\nSo I reached out to field biologist.\n\nHi, I’m Olivia.\n\nI'm a wildlife biologist.\n\nI contacted Olivia after she responded to my totally normal twitter request with this\n\ndope-ass picture.\n\nI figured that if anyone knew how to calculate the hit points of an animal, it would be someone\n\nholding a huge bird like it was a torch.\n\nHave you ever found the hit points of any of the animals you've been researching?\n\nI've never been involved in any sort of study where that was something that we looked at.\n\nSo no.\n\nOkay.\n\nBut there are probably plenty of studies about hit points with animals.\n\nProbably.\n\nThough she didn’t have experience with my specific question, I knew she would have some\n\nuseful advice for observing animals in their natural habitat.\n\nWhen you're observing an animal, how much interaction should you have with it?\n\nNone.\n\nNone.\n\nAt all.\n\nNone.\n\nYou have to sit in like a blind or a tent of some sort where you're hidden or you look\n\nlike part of the environment.\n\nYou could wear a ghillie suit.\n\nBrian - Oh!\n\nOlivia - People have also done that.\n\nHow long of a period are you observing that animal for?\n\nIt depends on how much time and resources you have, obviously.\n\nThere have been scientists that have been observing the same hawk for, like, 20 years in a row.\n\nSo if I'm trying to... perfectly know my pet's HP, I should be observing it for\n\nmultiple years.\n\nYes.\n\nCool.\n\nHow do you take notes when you're observing an animal.\n\nRight, so, I actually—can I send you something?\n\nYes, please.\n\nThis is exactly what I was looking for.\n\nOlivia had sent me an animal behavior data sheet, which I could use as a template for\n\nobserving and recording a pet’s behavior.\n\nBut some of these behaviors wouldn’t make sense when observing your pet on a random day.\n\nWe ended up developing a new sheet that had standard behaviors and class specific behaviors\n\nthat had different weights associated with them.\n\nYou observe your pet for X number of hours, tally up all the behaviors they did over the\n\ncourse of those hours, and then divide the weighted total by X to give you your pet’s level.\n\nThe logic behind this is that a higher level pet is more likely to do more intense and\n\nclass specific behaviors.\n\nThen you plug that level into this algorithm, and you get your pet’s HP.\n\nIt may seem challenging, but science shouldn’t be easy, it should be correct.\n\nThis is probably the hardest scientific work you've ever had to do.\n\nIt really is.\n\nYeah.\n\nWith these tips in mind, I welcome you into my home.\n\nIn order to test these calculations, I need a test subject.\n\nSo I’m using my roommate’s cat, Zuko!\n\nHe lives in my apartment but he doesn’t pay rent and he eats my bagels if I leave\n\nthem unattended.\n\nAs I mentioned previously, finding your pet's HP can be a fun bonding exercise, and in this\n\ncase, I’ve been dealing with this small bastard’s antics for so long, I need to\n\nremind myself why he’s here by quantifying his value.\n\nThe first step is easy!\n\nHe is a cat.\n\nThat puts him in the cat category.\n\nOkay.\n\nStep two, we gotta give Zuko a class.\n\nAs I mentioned previously, cats are often rogues, but I don't think that fits Zuko considering\n\nhe’s the least stealthy creature I know.\n\nHis meow sounds like he’s been smoking two packs a day for the past forty years.\n\n*incredibly raspy meow*\n\nAnd every time he does manage to sneak into his food cabinet,\n\nhe lets me know immediately.\n\nJust wanted to check in on what's going on up here in the cat cabinet where we keep all\n\nof the food for the cat.\n\n*loud crash*\n\nHe is loud, stubborn, and not afraid to make terrible decisions in plain\n\nview of me.\n\nAnd that makes this guy a Barbarian.\n\nOkay!\n\nBut now it is time to observe Zuko to find his level.\n\nAs per Olivia’s instructions, I must observe him for several years without any interaction.\n\nAfter explaining why I needed it, my time off request was denied.\n\nSo instead, I ate some bodega sushi in order to induce illness, and I took a sick day.\n\nMmmm.\n\nThis is the hard part, because it's going to require me to observe Zuko as he goes about\n\nhis daily business without him noticing that I am here at all.\n\nI assumed my position, and I waited for the interesting behaviors to start.\n\n*cheeky music plays*\n\nNot only was this terribly boring, but I was beginning to fear that Zuko\n\nwas not as strong as I had hoped.\n\nDO SOMETHING!\n\nPLEASE!\n\nBut then I realized there was a exploit in my system.\n\nThough Olivia, a scientist, said that you should keep your interferences to a minimum...\n\nI’m not a scientist, I’m a gamer.\n\nAnd I began what is known as power leveling.\n\nI had to get Zuko as many experience points as I could before my roommate got home and\n\nasked me what I was doing.\n\nOver the course of the day, Zuko averaged 63 behavioral experience points per hour,\n\nalthough those behaviors were somewhat coerced by me.\n\nI know that I broke my system by interacting with Zuko, but if it makes my pet happier\n\nand it makes him less of a weak-ass scrub, why wouldn’t I game the system!\n\nI had also noticed that Zuko and I had grown closer, our support level had increased to\n\nat least a B. I no longer saw him as a freeloader who sometimes throws up in my bed,\n\nI saw him as a companion...\n\nwho sometimes throws up in my bed.\n\nWhen I felt lonely in my empty apartment, he was there for me.\n\nWhen my stomach ached from the bodega sushi, he purred at just the right frequency to ease my pain.\n\nWhen I was worried he was going to be under leveled, he soothed my anxieties\n\nwith his heavenly voice.\n\n*beautiful meow*\n\nAnd all this time I had spent trying to calculate his HP,\n\nI hadn't realized he was replenishing mine.\n\nSo here is Zuko, Barbarian class level 63.\n\nI love him with all my heart, and he loves me just the same.\n\nOw!\n\nOkay, okay...\n\n*lots of wonderful meows*\n\nBeautiful.\n\nPsst!\n\nRemember when I said I really wanted to play the Cyberpunk RPG?\n\nWe finally did it.\n\nCome watch me play as a totally uncool forum moderator called Vang0Bang0.\n\nGuys don't say other things, we should only have one person in the...\n\nYou're making it sound like there are more than one person in...\n\nThere's only one person in the bathroom! ", ' *drum beat*\n\nTHE SIMS! While other games push you through the meticulously crafted story\n\nof some hero, this game allows you to experience the joy that comes from crafting your friends and family\n\nand then making them pee themselves in doorless rooms.\n\nI’ve been playing The Sims since I was a kid, and it allowed me to imagine what I might become.\n\nA successful doctor, perhaps, with a mansion\n\nand a pool that doesn’t have a ladder to get out of it.\n\nAnd now that I’m a D-list internet video producer with a grungy apartment in New York City,\n\nI’ve realized that I was using The Sims as wish fulfillment.\n\nPerhaps there’s a better way.\n\nI might only have one life, but my Sim can live many, many lives.\n\nI was playing a game.\n\nI should have been doing an experiment.\n\nSo today, I’m going to use The Sims to perfect my living situation.\n\n*music stops*\n\nOh what a surprise!\n\nNow, this Unraveled will be a little bit different\n\nconsidering most of it is going to be game footage, meaning...\n\nI don’t need any paper!\n\nLet me explain my methodology. We will have two subjects:\n\nSimulated Brian, and reality Brian, which is me, I’m Reality Brian.\n\nHere’s my hypothesis: If Simulated Brian’s living situation can be perfected in the Sims,\n\nthen Reality Brian’s living situation can also be perfected by altering it the same way in real life.\n\nNow, I could try to do this in a “perfectly controlled environment,” but life is messy and sometimes\n\nscience has to be messy, too. So before I can create my Sim...\n\nI gotta measure my apartment.\n\nObviously, I have to work with what I currently have. And if I’m supposed to make an honest\n\nsimulacrum of my living situation I gotta make sure it’s to scale.\n\nI should also point out that I live in a three bedroom apartment with two roommates and a cat. And although\n\nthey have rooms of their own, I will not be modeling them in the Sims.\n\nPartially because I rarely spend any time in their rooms, but it’s more because I am a good roommate\n\nwho respects personal boundaries. I will not redecorate their personal spaces.\n\nBut I will exploit the common space for content.\n\nWhen you cut my roommates rooms, you can split my apartment into 6 different sections.\n\nI used vanilla Sims 4, because I didn’t want Simulated Brian to accidentally become a wizard, or a skeleton,\n\nor a college student.\n\nThe first step is to make an accurate depiction of myself, both in personality and in appearance.\n\nThis took a good chunk of time, but it was worth it when I crafted an exact 1 to 1 replica\n\nof myself in the Sims. Then, I built the space. I used my measurements and gave myself close\n\nto unlimited funds to create the apartment, and bought myself the cheapest appliances\n\njust like my landlord did.\n\nAt the end of this, I had a pretty exact reproduction.\n\nThen it was test time.\n\nI gave myself a career similar to my own, and then I let Simulated Brian do his thing.\n\nMy rule was that I had to have little to no interaction.\n\nBut after a few days, it became clear that there were flaws with my experiment.\n\nOne, it was too slow.\n\nIf I want a longitudinal look at Simulated Brian’s living situation, I need to see his ENTIRE life.\n\nTwo, this experiment is meant to perfect my living situation, not my job.\n\nAnd currently, Sim Brian is finding enough fulfillment in his career, which is an uncontrolled space.\n\nSim Brian needs to stay in his apartment, and that means no job.\n\nThree, Sim Brian was perfectly content reading books,\n\nand everyone knows that books are BORING!\n\nSo I obviously need to fix whatever personality flaw turned my Sim into a dweeb.\n\nI addressed the first flaw by downloading a mod that would allow me to put on Ultra Fast Speed.\n\nI also altered my sim\'s personality to reflect my own… and I accepted that Simulated Brian’s appearance\n\nwasn’t all that accurate in the first trial, so I fixed that as well.\n\nWith the new personality traits and the ultra fast speed mod, this trial was far more accurate.\n\nI spent a lot of time standing in my bathroom, staring at the wall, or sadly contemplating my reflection.\n\nAnd then Sim Brian died of starvation after 4 days.\n\nWhich is a MASSIVE SUCCESS!\n\nI got to see the entirety of my Sim\'s life!\n\nIn trial 3, I took a hands-off approach.\n\nI popped on ultra fast speed, and I let it ride.\n\nIn this trial, I die of starvation after just 2 and a half days.\n\nWhich makes me think that this mod might be so fast that Sim Brian can’t feed himself.\n\nSo in trial 4, I start on normal fast speed,\n\nand I decide I’ll only jump to lightspeed when I’m bored.\n\nAnd things start well enough!\n\nSim Brian manages to socialize and stay happy for two days.\n\nIt starts to break down on Tuesday, when I find my sim\n\nsadly eating a grilled cheese in his empty kitchen.\n\nAnd then on Wednesday, Sim Brian sadly eats cereal while staring out the kitchen window.\n\nThings get real bad at 2 am on Thursday,\n\nwhen he stares in the mirror for hours.\n\nThe ennui has set in.\n\nThat afternoon, he stands in front of some dirty dishes on the coffee table,\n\ntoo depressed to wash them in the sink, which is mere feet away.\n\nSim Brian goes through the same motions for the next week.\n\nWatching TV. Staring in the mirror. Sleeping at random intervals. He seems devastatingly unhappy.\n\nBut he manages to live a much fuller life than the past two iterations!\n\nIt takes him nearly a week longer to die of starvation!\n\nExcept, he doesn’t really die.\n\nIn an effort to expedite the death sequence, I accidentally hit ultra fast speed,\n\nand for some reason,\n\nthis killed death.\n\nI waited, hoping the reaper would respawn, but no.\n\nSo I rushed through the days.\n\nWaiting for someone to find my collapsed body in the weird corner of my creepy hallway,\n\nbut the only people who noticed my quote unquote "death"\n\nwere the utility companies.\n\nI used this moment to look around my neighborhood.\n\nMost houses were far nicer.\n\nI was alone in a little box surrounded by neighbors who had forgotten me, or perhaps never knew I existed.\n\nEven death had forgotten me.\n\nI watched my slumped body linger in limbo as nothing changed.\n\nAfter a week, I resigned myself to quitting.\n\nAnd then in trial 5 I peed myself!\n\nA LOT!\n\nBoy, trial 5 exemplifies how much my apartment needs an upgrade.\n\nAt the beginning of the trial, my sim left the house to socialize.\n\nAnd he was so happy not being in his tiny apartment that he stayed outside for 12 hours,\n\nignoring his bodily functions, and at 9pm, while speaking to a potential new friend,\n\nhe peed himself.\n\nDoes this make the embarrassed and uncomfortable Sim go inside?\n\nNO.\n\nSim Brian so loathes his living space that he decides to stand outside all night browsing the internet,\n\nuntil again, he pees himself right before having a flirty conversation with his friend Terri.\n\nDirty, dirty Terri.\n\nAfter another full day outside,\n\nhunger, exhaustion, and the need to pee FINALLY make Sim Brian go home.\n\nHe was more willing to spend two nights soaked in piss before spending a single minute inside his apartment.\n\nBig Mood.\n\nThe rest of his life was typical. Mirror. Standing. Dying of starvation.\n\nAfter 5 control trials, it was time for the results.\n\nHere’s what I learned:\n\nOne, I’d rather spend time outside my house in repulsive conditions than spend time inside my house.\n\nSomething needs to change.\n\nTwo, the only thing that ever managed to make Sim Brian happy\n\nwas “good decoration.”\n\nI need to redecorate.\n\nAnd three, Sim Brian managed his basic needs until he became desolate due to a lack of social interaction.\n\nA hole so deep he couldn’t go anywhere but down.\n\nAnd this makes me believe that the thing that killed me was not starvation,\n\nbut rather becoming so lonely that I no longer sought to fix my situation.\n\nBut that has nothing to do with my apartment,\n\nso let’s focus on the things we can change!\n\nSimulated Brian was happiest in these terrible trials when the decorations were good,\n\nand that’s something I can fix in real life.\n\nBut before I do, let’s set some ground rules:\n\nOne, I can\'t alter any of the rooms in my apartment, or I\'d lose my security deposit.\n\nTwo, I can\'t change the furniture, because my roommates bought it, and then they’d hate me.\n\nAnd three, the money. I had considered giving my sim a budget similar to my own,\n\nbut money cannot buy happiness.\n\nAnd if this is true, then money, when compared to happiness, has no correlation.\n\nTherefore, money is no object, and my sim should be allowed to purchase anything regardless of price.\n\nInfinite money.\n\nSims decorations show how many environmental points they are worth.\n\nBy this logic, it doesn’t matter how well a room is decorated…\n\nit matters how MUCH a room is decorated.\n\nSo I spent a solid hour giving my apartment the most decorations possible.\n\nAllow me to give you a first person tour.\n\nThe Living Room now has lots of beautiful paintings.\n\nThe Weird Nook now has a purpose as The JAZZ Room, because for some reason,\n\nthe Sims has SO MANY JAZZ PAINTINGS.\n\nThe TV has to stay, but now I have three maps around it to say, “I’m also smart sometimes.”\n\nThe Kitchen hasn’t changed because it’s small and there’s no space to hang anything.\n\nThe creepiness of the hallway has crystallized into Sad Clowns.\n\nNo one wanted to spend much time in this hallway before,\n\nand now they REALLY don’t want to.\n\nIn my room, a bunch of portraits, an apple wall, and a pear wall.\n\nThis should remind my sim to eat food.\n\nAnd finally, in the bathroom, I installed a second mirror so I can’t just stare at the wall.\n\nNow let’s see it in action.\n\nIn the first trial, I did another hands off approach on ultra fast speed,\n\nand my sim once again died of starvation super quickly.\n\nSo, yeah, maybe the mod is too strong.\n\nBUT! In trial 2, things go way better.\n\nFor the first time in any of the trials,\n\nmy sim manages to go from Very Sad to Happy, thanks to the tasteful decorations!\n\nThough Sim Brian has moments of ennui and loneliness, for the most part, the house is making him happier.\n\nSim Brian does so well that he survives after the utilities shut off his power and water,\n\nand he dies of starvation after more than two weeks.\n\nThat’s nearly DOUBLE the length of any of the other trials!\n\nMY DECORATIONS WORKED!\n\nYeah, I still die of starvation, but I’m living TWICE AS LONG!\n\nAnd that’s all the proof I need that this is the perfect form of my apartment.\n\nAll I gotta do now is make it in real life.\n\nPolygon said that they wouldn’t reimburse me for purchasing thousands of dollars worth of paintings,\n\neven though I TOLD them it would make me more productive,\n\nso I gave myself a budget.\n\nThen I went to a lot of thrift stores to purchase\n\nas many paintings as I could find.\n\nSome fit the aesthetic. Others would need alterations.\n\nBut I got a lot of things! Or, I thought I had, until I got home and realized\n\nit wasn’t even going to cover one of my walls, let alone all six rooms.\n\nSo I dug around my apartment to find anything that could be stuck on the walls.\n\nIn the end, I was able to fill the entrance, but the rest of the living room was pretty sparse.\n\nIn the Jazz room I put up a papier mache man playing the piano, a dart board that felt pretty jazz to me,\n\nand a skeleton wearing a tank top that says "I heart my Daddy,"\n\nbecause...\n\nI honestly didn’t know where else I could put that.\n\nIn my own room, I put up the appletini painting and\n\nhung a huge self portrait from my senior year of high school.\n\nAnd that was it.\n\nThat’s all I had in terms of decorations.\n\nI took the day off to do this, but I was done in an hour.\n\nI even put on my suit in order to film the results of the trial,\n\nbut my house felt as empty as it had when I began.\n\nI couldn’t start the live experiment because I couldn’t recreate my sim’s house.\n\nBut I wasn’t giving up.\n\nIf I couldn’t purchase the decorations I needed, I figured I could make them myself.\n\nSo I bought a bunch of washable paint and 1000 feet of butcher paper.\n\n“I don\'t need any paper!”\n\nI lied.\n\nIt was a week before Thanksgiving. I was going to be out of town\n\nand I needed to finish this part of the video before I left.\n\nThat meant I had to create about 70 large paintings in less than three days.\n\nI got a solid start, painting all of the apples and pears.\n\nI even managed to edit the two paintings I got from the thrift store into Sad Clowns.\n\nBut I was halfway through the second Sad Clown when this process started weighing on me.\n\nIf I had to spend a few hours on 10 of the simplest paintings,\n\nthere was no way I was gonna get this finished before deadline.\n\nI was alone in an apartment making shitty paintings for a video that wasn’t gonna get made in time.\n\nI got a stress migraine, so I turned off the camera, and I went to lie down.\n\nWhen I woke up from that heinous nap,\n\nI decided to do one of the most difficult things I’ve had to do for an Unraveled:\n\nI asked for help.\n\nAnd if you’ve never had to ask your friends and coworkers\n\nto help you paint terrible paintings for a stupid video,\n\nlet me say you’re not missing out on much.\n\nIt’s an uncomfortable thing to ask people to do.\n\nAnd honestly, the weirdest part of this whole process is that...\n\npeople said yes.\n\nPeople said they\'d come help me paint.\n\nAnd, and they said yes just because they wanted to,\n\nand also \'cause I said I’d buy pizza,\n\nbut you gotta grease the wheels somehow.\n\nSo I turned my house into a painting factory. I cut the paper. I moved the furniture.\n\nAnd that night, people came over. Not just my roommate and my coworkers but my friends,\n\nand friends of those friends.\n\nI was expecting one or two people to help me, but I ended up with 10 people in my house,\n\nall painting large scale portraits\n\nand REALLY GOOD SAD CLOWNS.\n\nSeriously, who knew that my friends were SO GOOD at painting sad clowns?\n\nI don’t 100% know how to feel about how good my friends are at painting sad clowns,\n\nbut I\'m glad I gave \'em an outlet.\n\nAll of these people came over just to make my apartment happier.\n\nTo lend a hand when I was overwhelmed.\n\nAnd not only were they helping me make my apartment happier by decorating it,\n\nthey made it happier just by being there.\n\nThis task that had given me a stress migraine became a really fun time.\n\nAnd it reminded me that, although it can sometimes feel uncomfortable or embarrassing,\n\nif you ask for help, more often than not,\n\npeople are willing to help\n\nyou paint large pictures of jazz men.\n\nIn three hours, a task that seemed insurmountable by myself was complete.\n\nAnd I was so excited that I did the walkthrough while they were all still there.\n\nThe Living room with fabulous landscapes,\n\nThe Jazz room’s huge murals.\n\nThe Creepy clown hallway that was way too good.\n\nMy room with its amazing portraits and fruit walls.\n\nAnd the bathroom, where I stared at myself,\n\nnot considering my flaws or my apartment, but just smiling.\n\nThat’s it.\n\nJust smiling.\n\nIt’s been well over two weeks since my apartment was redecorated,\n\nwhich is longer than I survived in the Sims trials,\n\nso it’s been an incredible success.\n\nMy apartment is perfected, I’m happier with it, and it’s all thanks to the redecoration.\n\nOr at least, that’s part of it.\n\nI think that part of the reason I find so much joy in my apartment is knowing\n\nthat the decorations were made by people I care about.\n\nThere’s a story behind it.\n\nSimulated Brian fell further into sadness due to his isolation,\n\nbut the paint night turned Reality Brian’s terrible situation into something joyous.\n\nSo I have to wonder:\n\nDoes my newly perfected apartment make me happier because of the decorations,\n\nor because of the people who helped me decorate it?\n\nTrick question, it’s obviously the decorations.\n\n*club beat*\n\n*saxophone solo*\n\n*mouth trumpet noises*\n\n*dart rebounds off the board*\n\nJESUS! ', ' Ah, the Elder Scrolls, games chock-full of lore.\n\nAnd Skyrim is no different.\n\nHidden amongst the draugr and dragons is a plethora of books full of very important\n\nand incredibly niche details.\n\nBut with all the spellcasting and shouting you must do as dragonborn, who really has\n\nthe time to read all those books.\n\nI DO.\n\nAPPARENTLY.\n\nI read every book in Skyrim in order to answer the eternal question, “Should you read every\n\nbook in Skyrim?”\n\nAnd I’m here to give you my top five recommendations of books, here in my SKYRIM BOOK REPORT.\n\nSkyrim book report!\n\nHow many books are there, really, in Skyrim?\n\nAfter all, there are only eight people credited as writers on Skyrim.\n\nThose eight people are responsible for every quest, every voice acting line, every response\n\nyou can give to an NPC.\n\nHow much time do they have to write all those other books?\n\nA lot!\n\nBecause they wrote this many books.\n\nThis many books.\n\n*pained grin*\n\nOr at least they wrote most of them because a few of them have been grandfathered in from\n\nother Elder Scrolls games.\n\nBefore I get into the nitty gritty, let me explain my process on how I did this Skyrim\n\nBook Report.\n\nI printed out every book in Skryim, and then I spent multiple eight-hour days reading EVERY.\n\nSINGLE.\n\nBOOK.\n\nI whittled it down to 338 books because I didn’t include journals or diaries.\n\nEveryone knows that self-published doesn’t count.\n\nIn total, that’s 571 pages, five and a half point font, over three hundred and sixteen\n\nTHOUSAND words.\n\nI had two reactions to this.\n\nMy first reaction was, “Wow.”\n\nThis is an incredible amount of world building.\n\nTo write 300,000 words that could essentially be skipped over while still having the full\n\nSkyrim experience, it’s amazing, and it’s a level of world building that could only\n\nexist in an interactive medium.\n\nAnd for that, I commend you, Bethesda.\n\nMy second reaction to this,\n\nwas WHAT THE FUCK.\n\nHEY TODD?\n\nWHAT THE FU-\n\nIn my Skyrim Book Report, I will be discussing:\n\n*smack*\n\nThat’s a smash cut.\n\nHopefully.\n\nIf I do my editing correctly.\n\n338 books.\n\nUh, actually, 337, I just realized, um, over here, Songs of Skyrim, I put both of them\n\nin there, but there’s a revised edition.\n\nI lied.\n\nIt’s just 337 books now.\n\nObviously, I don’t have time to synopsize all of these, and believe me, you wouldn’t\n\nwant to watch that even if I could.\n\nI’ve split them into categories to make this a little bit easier.\n\nFirst up, historical books!\n\nThese book titles you see rolling up the screen are all biographies or histories.\n\nWhat I categorized as histories was anything that had big historical dates in them, explanatory\n\nhistories, or pretty much anything that was boring.\n\nHistory’s so BORING.\n\nUGHHHH.\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien\n\n*kiss*\n\ndid the world a disservice by making every single fantasy writer think\n\nthat they need to chronicle every goddamn minute of their world in order for it to be\n\nlegitimate.\n\nI don’t give two shits about a king who lost a war 700 years ago.\n\n*snoring noises* Get OUTTA here!\n\nSome of these biographies are actually pretty interesting.\n\nBut a lot of them are written like The Chronicles of Nchuleft.\n\nI didn’t tab it out ‘cause it’s a shitty story.\n\n“It happened in Second Planting (P.D. 1220) that Lord Ihlendam, on a journey in the Western\n\nUplands, came to Nchuleft; and Protector Anchard and General Rkungthunch met him there, and\n\nDalen-Zanchu also came to the meeting.\n\nThey talked together long by themselves; but this only was known of their business, that\n\nthey were to be friends of each other.\n\nThey parted, and each went home to his own colony.”\n\nRIVETING.\n\nUgh.\n\nHistory’s so boring.\n\nI’m done with this.\n\nNext category: Instructional books!\n\nThese are all field guides or basic recipes about how to make good armor or what flowers\n\ngo in which potions.\n\nAt best, they are in-fiction instructional books.\n\nAt worst, they are so obviously trying to get you to go do specific things.\n\nPulls you right out of the fiction!\n\nC’mon man.\n\nThat’s all I’m gonna say about that.\n\nEveryone’s favorite: the academic books.\n\nFun fact about academic books that I learned in college\n\nis that no one has ever enjoyed writing or reading an academic paper.\n\nWHY’D YOU PUT IT IN A VIDEO GAME.\n\nMythicaaaaal stories.\n\nIt’s kind of weird to differentiate things between myth and history, especially in this\n\nworld where you can talk to demon princes.\n\nI split these two up because these are very boring and these are slightly more palatable.\n\nThey’re more like creation myths, or they’re just like random stories that are fun to read,\n\nso they’re getting closer to good fiction.\n\nThe poetic and dramatic.\n\nEveryone knows that poetry and theatre are meant to be seen and not read.\n\nAnd you have NO IDEA how much it pains me that I do not have time to do staged readings\n\nof all these.\n\nOh my GOD I would have loved that.\n\nWe have “eh.”\n\nWhat genre is “eh?”\n\nIt’s the catchall.\n\nUm, these tend to be accounts, kind of like medieval fantasy op-eds.\n\nSo I…\n\nI just put ‘em here.\n\nEH!\n\nWe’re done with these now, so…\n\nGet outta here!\n\nFinally, we have 59 books that I would consider good fiction.\n\nGooooOOOD fiction.\n\nWhat I did here is I gave myself three criteria about what would make good fiction in the\n\nrealm of Skyrim.\n\nNumber one, does it help build the world around us?\n\nNumber two, does it give us an interesting or different perspective on that world?\n\nAnd number three, is it good?\n\nNow you might say, “Brian, what gives you the right to say what is good fiction?”\n\nI READ ALL 338 YA DINGUS.\n\nBELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY THAT THESE WERE THE ONLY GOOD ONES.\n\nTHIS IS ALL I’M QUALIFIED TO DO NOW.\n\nI need a drink.\n\n*deep breath*\n\nOkay!\n\nThere’s still 59 of these, so I obviously can’t summarize all of them, but I have\n\nleft five off, and they are my top five books of Skyrim.\n\nSo we’re gonna talk about those.\n\nNumber five, Advances in Lockpicking.\n\nNow Advances in Lockpicking is actually an instructional book.\n\nBut I think it does more than just the other instructional books, where you open them up\n\nand suddenly you’re better at lockpicking, because it’s written by a thief in a very\n\ninteresting voice.\n\nThere’s a great ending line for this book: “Some thieves can’t read.\n\nIf you can’t read, get someone to read this book to you.\n\nIt will make more sense then.”\n\nThat’s great.\n\nI think that’s a much more fun way than saying, “Here is how you pick a lock.\n\nThis is what this set of armor is.”\n\nBetter than instructional.\n\nJust good fiction.\n\nNumber four, Palla.\n\nIn a world where crazy creatures exist, how do you make fiction that is compelling that\n\npeople can just kind of experience in their own life.\n\nPalla is a necromantic romantic book.\n\nIt’s a story about a man who sees this beautiful statue of a woman fighting a beast and falls\n\ninstantly in love with this woman.\n\nTurns out, she’s dead!\n\nFrom fighting that beast.\n\nHe decides to get into necromancy to bring her back from the dead.\n\nI kind of don’t want to ruin the surprise for you.\n\nIt manages to tell an interesting story while also introducing these ideas of monsters and\n\nnecromancy.\n\nIt’s kind of weird, but it’s very well written.\n\nI’m gonna go ahead and put up three and two.\n\nWhy do I put up the Argonian Account and Feyfolken at the same time?\n\nTurns out, it’s written by the same fictional author: WAUGHIN JARTH.\n\nThis one’s for you, Waughin!\n\nI’m a big Jarth head!\n\nHe’s not actually in the story at all, I couldn’t find any instance of, like, him\n\nas an NPC.\n\nSo I really hope he’s in the next one.\n\nBecause I want to meet Waughin.\n\nI just want to meet Waughin Jarth.\n\nThese ones were not actually written specifically for Skyrim.\n\nThey were grandfathered in.\n\nBut they do an incredible job of building the world around you.\n\nThe Argonian Account is actually the second story in a series all about Decumus Scotti.\n\nThis is kind of like the Hobbit of Tamriel, where we’re taking this unassuming character\n\nand thrusting them into this completely foreign, amazing landscape, except instead of a hobbit,\n\nit is a midlevel bureaucrat.\n\nIt’s full of screwball comedy and wonderful worldbuilding about the Black Marsh which\n\nis where all the Argonians live.\n\nYou have to fast travel by being eaten alive by a worm.\n\nThat’s great.\n\nI want to see that whenever we go to the Black Marsh.\n\nIt’s so flavorful, and that’s why I’m a Jarth head.\n\nFeyfolken.\n\nIt’s a story about a scribe who’s terrible at his job but gets this enchanted quill that\n\nforces him to be amazing.\n\nSends himself into this madness, and he kills himself at the end of the book, spoiler alert.\n\nBut that’s not what this story is really about.\n\nIt’s an interesting fiction that teaches you about different Daedric princes, and which\n\nones could have caused this specific enchantment on the quill.\n\nThat’s good worldbuilding!\n\nI am interested in the story!\n\nYou told me something that I can learn about the world.\n\nI had a good time reading Feyfolken!\n\nJarth, ya did it again!\n\nAnd that leaves us with the number one book.\n\nIt’s not The Lusty Argonian Maid.\n\nI feel like I should broach this subject.\n\nI’ll tell you why I didn’t include it in my good fiction list,\n\nand it’s not because I’m a prude, who doesn’t love a little erotic lizard fiction?\n\n*OOH COME ON BABY*\n\nThe reason I didn’t include The Lusty Argonian Maid as one of the best\n\npieces of fiction is because it’s SEVEN ACTS LONG.\n\nSeven acts?\n\nThere is no way you can manage to maintain that level of erotic tension for seven acts.\n\nThat’s like five and a half hours!\n\nAs a person who has done one or two plays in my life, that’s just unfeasible.\n\nOkay?\n\nI’d like to see them try.\n\n~I would like to see them try~\n\n*OOH COME ON BABY*\n\nBefore I go to number one, I gotta go\n\nget a flu shot.\n\nThis is not a joke.\n\nIt’s important to get your flu shot.\n\nAlright, I’m back.\n\nThe number one piece of fiction in Skyrim, not Waughin Jarth, I’m sorry.\n\nIt’s Beggar, Thief, Warrior, King.\n\nIt’s four books, actually.\n\nBut it’s all part of Eslaf Erol’s story.\n\nIt is completely fiction even within the fiction of Skyrim.\n\nThe reason I put it first is because it’s the only book that was legitimately hilarious.\n\nI straight up chortled.\n\n*chortle*\n\nThat’s what I did.\n\nIn real life.\n\nThat’s amazing.\n\nThe writing style of these four books is just naturally hilarious.\n\nThere are so many bland, cookie-cutter stories in Skyrim that follow the same set up, twist, punchline.\n\nThis doesn’t have that.\n\nIt’s just a good story.\n\nOne of these writers was just flexing, and I think that’s wonderful that a writer had\n\na chance to—within the fiction of Skyrim—write something that’s just naturally funny.\n\nYou should all go home, onto your computers, boot up Skyrim, find these four books, and\n\nthen read them, in order.\n\nIt’s worth it!\n\nThat’s my quest, for you in Skyrim.\n\n300 gold points.\n\nThat’s it!\n\nThat’s it, that’s all of the books.\n\nSo like, what did I learn from reading all 338 books of Skyrim?\n\nSurprisingly, a whole lot.\n\nLike, there are two main takeaways that I pulled from this.\n\nNumber one, this is a masterclass on how to write effective flavor text.\n\nBetween all of these, historical, instructional, the good fiction, and, you know, the iffy fiction.\n\nThis is a way to learn what to do and what not to do.\n\nObviously, not everyone is going to connect with certain types of flavor text.\n\nI’m sure there’s a lot of people that disagree with me and think that the historical\n\nis the most important flavor text.\n\nAnd you know what?\n\nThey are valid.\n\nAnd they’re wrong.\n\nAnd they always seem to find my comment sections.\n\nWhen you take something good like Feyfolken which teaches you about the Daedric princes,\n\nbut in an interesting way, it really shines in comparison to the three and a half million\n\nbiographies of Barenziah.\n\nYou don’t even see them in Skyrim.\n\nI don’t care about Barenziah.\n\nIT’S BORIIIIIII-\n\nBut not like Feyfolken!\n\nThat’s really interesting and effective.\n\nAlso it just teaches you about all these wonderful forms of fiction.\n\nIf you’re a fiction teacher, like, teach your kids with Skyrim!\n\nTEACH THE KIDS.\n\nWITH SKYRIM.\n\nI got a creative writing degree.\n\nThat’s all I have to say about that.\n\nSecond takeaway, this is a wonderful teaching device about unreliable narrators.\n\nSo many of these histories are negating other ones.\n\nThis is a wonderful way of showing people you need to read everything if you’re going\n\nto get the whole picture.\n\nI read everything.\n\nI am the keeper of the picture.\n\nThat’s every book in Skyrim.\n\nSo it’s time for us to revisit that ever present question, “Should you read every\n\nbook in Skyrim?”\n\nNO!\n\nWHAT?\n\nHOW COULD YOU WATCH THIS WHOLE 10+ MINUTE VIDEO AND THINK THAT I WOULD SAY ANYTH- WHAT?\n\nNO!\n\nI BORE THIS BURDEN!\n\nFOR YOU!\n\nDON’T READ THEM!\n\nNO!\n\nPlease don’t read them all.\n\nDON’T READ THEM!\n\nYou can read the top five, that’s fine.\n\nGRRRRR.\n\nHOW DARE YOU JETTISON MY GIFT!\n\nDON’T READ THEM!\n\nNOOOOOOOOOOO\n\nIf you want to see me keep doing things like this, make sure to hit that subscribe button.\n\nAnd now for a staged reading of The Sultry Argonian Bard.\n\nPat: I could never perform your request.\n\nBDG: Oh!\n\nIs it too fast for you.\n\nPat: I fear I may damage my… instrument.\n\nBDG: Ah, but you seem to handle it so well my darling.\n\nPat: My lady you flatter me.\n\nBDG: Well it is such a LARGE and MAGNIFICENT piece. ', " Sonic the Hedgehog has been enjoying a bit of resurgence as of late\n\nbecause of his upcoming feature film.\n\nWhich is great because\n\nOH! OH THOSE LEGS ARE WAY TOO HUMAN.\n\nTHOSE LEGS ARE...\n\nOH MY GOD.\n\nTHOSE LEGS LOOK LIKE I COULD HAVE THOSE LEGS.\n\nPLEASE DON'T SHOW THAT TO ME ANYMORE.\n\nPLEASE GET.\n\nGET IT OUT OF HERE.\n\nscreaming\n\nThis new Sonic has a lot of fans crying heresy.\n\nSonic should be that cute, blue, cartoon hedgehog that’s gotta go fast,\n\nand that’s all he’s gotta do.\n\nBut what if I told you that this was not the only blasphemous version of Sonic\n\nWhat if I told you that nearly every single piece of Sonic media was heretical\n\nI hold in my hand 13 pages that prove just that.\n\nBefore I hop into the deep end, I need to explain a little about Sega, these 13 pages,\n\nand how Sonic was made.\n\nYou see, Sega was in a real tough spot in the early ‘90s as it tried to compete with\n\nNintendo and the overwhelmingly successful Mario.\n\nSo they worked internally to create a new mascot.\n\nNot just for a game, but for the company as a whole.\n\nNaoto Ohshima created Mr. Needlemouse, a teal hedgehog with red sneakers.\n\nAnd then he worked with Yuji Naka to create a game around this wonderful creature.\n\nA few tweaks and Sonic the Hedgehog was born.\n\nOr at least one version of Sonic was born.\n\nYou see, Sega wasn’t just fighting with Nintendo, it was also fighting with itself.\n\nSega of America and Sega of Japan had a lot of tension between them, and they didn’t\n\nsee eye to eye on a lot of things, especially when it came to Sonic.\n\nThe original version of Sonic was a bit more punk rock and had a girlfriend.\n\nA real life human girlfriend named Madonna.\n\nAnd we all know that Sega would never make Sonic kiss a real human woman.\n\ndiscomfort\n\nSo Sega of America started to iron things out a little bit.\n\nMake Sonic a bit more family friendly.\n\nMore marketable.\n\nMadeline Schroeder, the self-described mother of Sonic, wrote out this 13-page bible that\n\nset out Sonic's true origins.\n\nThese 13 pages went on to become the true Sonic.\n\nThe Sonic we all know and love.\n\nRight\n\nNOPE.\n\nTHIS BIBLE HAS HAD VERY LITTLE BEARING ON THE SERIES AS A WHOLE.\n\nBut here’s the thing, friends.\n\nIt should have a lot of bearing on the series as a whole.\n\nAnd I am willing to wield this bible as a paladin wields a holy sword so that I might\n\nEXCISE SIN OUT FROM THE SONIC CANON.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nThat was a lot.\n\nI was a bit too intense for...\n\nI'm gonna tone it down a little bit.\n\nFolks, we’re about to engage in a friendly session of biblical literalism.\n\nNow, I’m not one to advocate taking a written account as the pure truth and nothing but...\n\nbut for Sonic I’m willing to bend my values a little bit.\n\nWe're about to take everything written in these 13 pages as gospel, and anything that deviates\n\nfrom the facts therein as sacrilege.\n\nLet’s get Sonically Fundamental.\n\nI’m not gonna read this bible in its entirety.\n\nYou can read it online if you'd like.\n\nBut I am going to read the first paragraph in full, because I think it's important for\n\nyou to understand what we’re dealing with.\n\n“Sonny Hedgehog was born on Earth in the early 21st century, in the town of Hardly,\n\nNebraska, population 1,226.”\n\nFrom the first line alone, we already know that\n\n1. Sonic’s birth name is actually Sonny.\n\n2. He is a real hedgehog that was born circa 2000.\n\nAnd 3. He’s a midwestern boy.\n\n“He and his mother and five sisters live underneath a scraggly hedge beside the local\n\nburger joint, and subsist on burger scraps, milkshakes, and the occasional slug or bug\n\nthat crawls their way.\n\nThey are a poor but happy family.”\n\nFrom these lines we know that\n\n4. Sonic's family lives in an actual hedge, which is I guess why they're called hedgehogs.\n\nAnd 5. They have a very similar diet to me.\n\n“Unfortunately, Sonny’s dad died when Sonny was just a few days old, after falling\n\ninto a gurgling, festering vat of toxic waste dumped in a nearby pond.”\n\n…\n\nWhat\n\nSonic, the lighthearted hedgehog we all know and love.\n\nNever knew his father because he was reduced to sludge thanks to corporate pollution.\n\nThere are 30 key tenets in the Sonic bible,\n\nand I'm just gonna go ahead and list them off real quick.\n\njust a big ol' mess of words from the Sonic bible\n\nThe 30 tenets of the Sonic the Hedgehog bible.\n\nLook at 'em up there.\n\nBeautiful.\n\nPractically glowing with potential energy.\n\nThe potential energy I shall release into a HOLY FLAME, SO THAT I MIGHT BURN OUT THE\n\nBLASPHEMY FROM SONIC'S MODERN ITERATIO...\n\nPat I think, uh, we should probably just take a couple minutes, just to, just to like...\n\nBrian Okay.\n\nPat I'll... do you need water or anything\n\nBrian Water... yeah, I think that'd be good.\n\nNow, most of these are not found in most of the iterations of Sonic, but there are three\n\nthat specifically decanonize every game in the Sonic franchise.\n\nLet's talk about 'em.\n\nNumber 18 There are seven chaos emeralds, one is a stabilizer.\n\nYou might have heard me say the name Kintobor.\n\nHe turns into Dr. Robotnik after he is fused the powers of the chaos emeralds and a hard-boiled egg.\n\nNot a joke.\n\nBut he was originally looking for the chaos emeralds so that we he could bundle them up\n\nand then launch them into space, thus reversing all pollution on the planet Earth.\n\nThe reason for that is because the Chaos Emeralds “contain a microlytic copy of all the inert\n\nenergy of every gross and disgusting impulse or deed done by humans since the beginning of time.”\n\nIgnoring that microlytic is the name of a company and not an actual scientific term,\n\nthis seems to state that the chaos emeralds are just a crystalline form of every gross impulse.\n\nEvery time you pick your nose instead of using a tissue.\n\nThat’s in the emerald.\n\nEvery time you wear your underwear five times in a week 'cause you think it doesn't smell that bad.\n\nThat's in the emerald.\n\nEvery time you go three days without shampooing\n\nI get it.\n\nLook, sometimes, you know, the shampoo has sulfates and that can damage to your hair.\n\nWe all have different scalps.\n\nBUT THAT'S IN THE EMERALD, TOO.\n\nMost of the games just state the chaos emeralds are an incredible source of power, something\n\nthat will help you to take over the world or become Super Sonic.\n\nThey don't ever mention that they are essentially just garbage diamonds.\n\nHad Sega included one piece of flavor text, like “You got a chaos emerald.\n\nYou should probably go wash your hands, now.”\n\nThen it would’ve been fine.\n\nBut they didn’t.\n\nNumber 21 Kintobor was a father figure.\n\nJust as a reminder, Sonic’s dad died in a vat\n\nof toxic waste.\n\nWhich is why it meant so much when Kintobor offered him an assistantship.\n\n“Sonny was thrilled at the prospect.\n\nBecause although Sonny had never known his father, Kintobor reminded him of the kind\n\nface in the photograph.”\n\nHeartbreaking.\n\nCan you imagine the drama in this\n\nSega, you keep trying to do these gritty reboots of Sonic.\n\nSonic plus gun.\n\nSonic plus getting kissed by a human woman.\n\nYou don’t need all that.\n\nIt's all right here!\n\nYou are literally pitting Sonic, a hedgehog without a father, against the man who became\n\nhis father figure and then turned evil thanks to the machines that SONIC HELPED CREATE.\n\nI hear you saying, “Brian, there’s no evidence that Sonic doesn’t think of Robotnik\n\nas a father figure!”\n\nAnd to that I say bullSHIT.\n\nI have NEVER SEEN HIM CRY AFTER DEFEATING ROBOTNIK.\n\nI HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM HOLD THE LIFELESS BODY OF HIS FATHER FIGURE AND SAY,\n\nI am sorry it had to turn out like this!\n\nI am sorry!\n\nLET SONIC CRY OVER THE LOSS OF WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN, SEGA.\n\nYOU COWARDS.\n\nAnd finally, the third and most important tenet that destroys the entirety of the Sonic canon.\n\nNumber 11 Sonic helps quilters.\n\nHave you ever seen Sonic in a quilting circle\n\nCause he should be there.\n\n“While making the rounds for juicy tidbits and gossip, he would drop in on the ladies\n\nof the local quilting circle to offer a convenient pin or needle from his ample, portable supply.”\n\nWHERE IS MY SONIC GAME WITH A QUILTING CIRCLE\n\nSonic CD shitty.\n\nSonic Mania trash.\n\nSonic Hedgehog 2.\n\nMore like Sonic the Hedgehog Too MUCH OF A DUNCE TO INCLUDE TO THE QUILTING CIRCLE THAT\n\nIS SO INTEGRAL TO SONIC'S BACKSTORY!\n\nAnd with that, we have decanonized the entirety of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise.\n\nBut from this scorched earth can bloom a mighty flower.\n\nThe true Sonic the Hedgehog.\n\nWhat would that video game look like\n\nWhat are the ramifications of a Sonic the Hedgehog game based on the bible\n\nThe Sonic the Hedgehog bible.\n\nLet’s go through this piece by piece.\n\nWe start the game with a legitimate hedgehog who lives in a hedge and his name is Sonny.\n\nAnd it's 2019, and he's got brown quills, and they won't become blue until he gets faster.\n\nAnd he eats food that is similar to the food that I eat.\n\nHe lives in Hardly, Nebraska, which is where the entire game is set, so you better get ready\n\nfor running in lots of corn fields.\n\nHis eyesight’s not good, but it’s okay cause he’ll get rec specs since he is able\n\nto read but is also on the track team.\n\nSo the entire game is actually just running in track meets in the middle of a corn field.\n\nWhen he’s not running track, he’s at the bowling alley or the playground or the quilting\n\ncircle doing normal hedgehog things.\n\nThe problem is that his town has SO MUCH POLLUTION, which is how his dad died, and it’s also\n\nwhy Kintobor (now Robotnik), the trim kindly scientist who gave Sonic his new nickname\n\nand the ability to speak the human tongue, was trying to solve with his new physics theories\n\nand his machines and all of those terrible gross seven chaos emeralds before he became\n\nevil and also a bit of an egg.\n\nThis is especially rough because Kintobor, before he became Robotnik, would feed Sonic\n\nreally good food and was basically a father figure to him.\n\nAlso Sonic is good at computer science.\n\nSo the game is basically an evil polluting scientist being taken down by a midwestern\n\nteenage hedgehog track star with daddy issues.\n\nSo it’s basically if the CW rebooted Sonic.\n\nReach out to me, CW, I will license this.\n\nBut I haven’t used all 30 of these tenets.\n\nSee, there are four of them that, to be perfectly honest, shouldn’t be possible.\n\nAnd beyond that, they are impossible to put into a game.\n\nI've hit a bit of a roadblock.\n\nNumber seven shows Sonic's dead father winking at him through a picture on the wall, which\n\nproves the existence of an afterlife in the Sonic Universe.\n\nNumber 15 shows that Sonic is able to hibernate below delta waves.\n\nAnd those are the slowest possible brain waves.\n\nAbout 0.5 hertz.\n\nTo go below them, Sonic would have probably died.\n\nAnd yet he is resurrected and lives again.\n\nAnd number 24, Sonic is shown to run at the speed of light.\n\nAnd if the rules of relativity are to be believed, that means his mass would have to infinitely\n\nexpand, and he would need infinite energy to do this.\n\nAnd that would destroy the world.\n\nAnd yet he is able to do that without harming himself or those around him.\n\nNumber 30 is actually within the bible itself.\n\nIt states, “But like most peaceful times in the twenty-first century, it didn’t last long.”\n\nThis bible was written in 1991, nine years before the twenty-first century, and yet it\n\nprophesied our challenging political landscape.\n\nThese four pieces of information are not purely canonical information.\n\nThey are...\n\ndivine miracles.\n\nSo of course I could not put them into a game.\n\nThey could only fit in a religion.\n\nSo I went on to wikiHow, the foremost explainer of how to do things, and I knew somewhere,\n\nhidden in their beautiful imagery would be the way that I could spread the word of Sonic\n\nto the masses.\n\nAnd before you get upset with me, saying,\n\nBrian, aren't you just starting a cult\n\nLook at this question answered by Cutegirlcorr\n\nTechnically speaking, religions and cults are the same thing.\n\nSo I have formed my religion around Sonic the Hedgehog.\n\nAnd guess what\n\nI have a confession!\n\nI'VE NEVER PLAYED A SONIC GAME.\n\nNEVER IN MY LIFE.\n\nI only tell you this now because you've already made it this far into the video,\n\nand the sunk cost fallacy states that if you feel like you've invested something,\n\nyou're gonna see it through to the end.\n\nBut it's okay that I haven't played a Sonic game.\n\nBecause that means I haven't been tainted!\n\nI have never beheld the false Sonic!\n\nOnly someone blind to the modern blasphemies of the Sonic franchise\n\ncould see as clearly as I!\n\nBecause if a hedgehog could commune with the dead,\n\nbe resurrected,\n\nrun with infinite energy,\n\nand HAVE HIS GOSPEL PROPHECY THE FUTURE,\n\nTHEN EITHER SONIC IS A GOD\n\nOR COULD KILL GOD\n\nAND I DO NOT CARE IF THERE IS A DIFFERENCE!\n\nHello, friends, I’d like to take a moment now and apologize for my recent outburst.\n\nI’ve taken some time and cooled down since filming this video, and though I suppose I\n\ncould have just not uploaded it to YouTube, I decided it would serve well as a cautionary tale.\n\nYou see, taking lore to be purely literal, whether that's for a video game or backstory\n\nfor a TV show, is a dangerous rabbit hole that can often lead to anger.\n\nBiblical literalism is just an early form of fandom.\n\nSometimes, you gotta be a little bit more lenient.\n\nBecause sometimes, the bible was written to make a character\n\nmore marketable to kids in the '90s.\n\nSo let’s learn from this example, and make sure to take new additions to our favorite things in stride.\n\nEven if it’s these legs.\n\nI’m sorry, I can't in good conscience agree with that.\n\nI do not agree with those legs.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nI could spr... if you spray painted my legs blue, I could cosplay as this Sonic.\n\nDo you think I should do that\n\nDo you think I should spray paint my legs blue for a Sonic cosplay\n\nJust half...\n\nJust half, half down Sonic.\n\nNot gonna do anything else to my body, just...\n\nWhat are the ramifications of a Sonic the Hedgehog game based on the bible\n\neveryone loses it ", ' Stamina! That mysterious green juice that powers our muscles.\n\nIn video games, it allows characters to cleave dragons, climb volcanoes,\n\nand lightly jog through a prairie.\n\nI look at these heroic tasks, and I think…\n\nHow?\n\nLook, I’m usually pretty high energy, but the fact of the matter is that\n\nI’ve been stuck at home for the past two months\n\nand I’ve cultivated the stamina of a cartoon basset hound.\n\nI used to be so much more productive, and my energy has just completely vanished.\n\nIs it because I’ve been having trouble adjusting to this new working-from-home lifestyle?\n\nOr is it because my build is trash?\n\nToday, I’m saying goodbye to that boring, languid Brian, and I am going to use the things I’ve learned\n\nfrom video games to maximize my stamina.\n\n*synth music*\n\nI gotta go ham on these graphics ‘cause I don’t have a studio anymore.\n\nThere are two main ways that stamina is represented in video games:\n\nstamina bars that automatically replenish, and stamina bars that don’t.\n\nAnd these different representations lead to different techniques for boosting that stamina.\n\nMy hypothesis is that if I use these same stamina techniques in real life,\n\nthen I will finally have the energy to address laundry chair.\n\n*Sad accordion music*\n\nThere are four methods of augmenting your stamina in video games.\n\nLet’s start with the easiest one to understand. Item Refills.\n\nYou expend some energy, you eat something to replenish that energy. It\'s basic biology.\n\nThe Krebs cycle or something like that…\n\nI am not interested, get that shit outta here.\n\nThe problem is that most video games are usually more fantastical than real life.\n\nOftentimes the item you need to consume is an elixir made from arcane magicks\n\nsiphoned from the very lifeblood that sustains our world.\n\nOr, if you’re Hideo Kojima, it’s Monster Energy.\n\nGod bless you Death Stranding for having a magical canteen\n\nthat effortlessly turns dangerous Timefall into a branded energy drink.\n\nYou know, for a video game that loves to give you a 40-minute-long cutscene\n\nexplaining why some dipshit is named "HOTWETMAN" or whatever,\n\nthis piece of world building has a much simpler explanation:\n\nMONEY.\n\nAnd thanks to this shameless product placement, I have a concrete way to determine how to refill stamina.\n\nJudging by Sam’s experience, it takes about 600 milliliters of Monster Energy to fully juice your bar.\n\nAnd given the fact that this logic exists in a world where everyone is stuck in isolated homes\n\nand delivery people are among the most important of essential workers,\n\nI think it’s safe to say that conditions could not be better suited for this experiment.\n\nThe biggest difference between me and Sam Bridges is that I’m not getting paid by Monster Energy,\n\nso I don’t have to pretend to like it.\n\nTechnique 2: Slowing Depletion.\n\nUnlike item refills, this one asks you to do some planning.\n\nYou only consume one of these items before you have to do a huge task,\n\nso it usually shows up in games where preparation is key,\n\nlike when you have to go fight a 40-ton pickle.\n\nMonster Hunter has battles that can last upwards of an hour,\n\nwhich can make the preparation as important, and as long, as the actual fight itself.\n\nKinda like eating a full pasta bake before the big track meet.\n\nThere are quite a few ways to slow stamina depletion in Monster Hunter,\n\nbut sometimes the simplest option is the best one,\n\nand in this case, the simplest option is steak.\n\nSteak is made from raw meat in Monster Hunter\n\n— and also the real world —\n\nand if you eat it, it boosts your max stamina.\n\nBut the effects change based on how you cook it.\n\nA rare steak refills your stamina bar and makes it longer,\n\nbut a well-done steak does all that AND it slows your max stamina depletion.\n\nThe steak snobs among you may turn up your nose at the assertion\n\nthat a well-done meat is better than a wet, juicy, rare one…\n\nBut I posit to you this question:\n\nWhich one would you rather have jangling around in your leather satchel?\n\nSo I’ll be cooking these meats until they are all-the-way gray.\n\nTechnique 3: Stamina Regeneration.\n\nWith this technique, every time you use stamina, you’ll get it back faster.\n\nAnd there is no game that makes you say,\n\n“come on refill come on come ON COME ON COME ON REFI-”\n\nmore than Dark Souls.\n\nIn Dark Souls you consume stamina every time you attack, block, run, parry, roll, backstep,\n\nbackstab, ripost, jump, shoot arrows, call your mom, check your bank account…\n\nAnd if you’re in the middle of a boss fight and you have run out of the stamina necessary\n\nto dodge roll or swing your big sword,\n\nwell, them’s the breaks, kid.\n\nLuckily, there are some accessories that speed up that stamina regeneration.\n\nAnd even more luckily, you can purchase legitimate versions of these items for about... 300 bucks.\n\nUh, no thank you. I can make that at home.\n\nAnd even if I did have the means to purchase these official props,\n\nthere’s still one massive problem.\n\nThe in-game items are imbued with dark, abyssal magicks\n\nthat I simply do not have the arcane wisdom to conjure.\n\nLuckily, I do have one little piece of magic I can use.\n\nIt’s called: The placebo effect!\n\nThere are plenty of psych studies that show that clothing choices\n\ncan have an effect on our mood and your confidence,\n\nand there are even more studies that show that placebos can have legitimate beneficial effects,\n\nso why wouldn’t donning The Mask of the Child help me deal with laundry chair?\n\n*More sad accordion music*\n\nAnd finally, technique 4: Permanent Increases.\n\nThis is by far the best way to maximize your stamina.\n\nWhen you’ve got all the stamina in the world, even the heaviest of tasks won’t phase you.\n\nThere are plenty of realistic games that use this technique, like Red Dead Redemption 2,\n\nwhere the only way to increase your max stamina is to do a bunch of stamina heavy tasks, like sprinting.\n\nBut the thing about this technique is that…\n\nIT SUCKS.\n\nUH, I’M SORRY?! You’re telling me that in order to have more energy,\n\nI have to use up all the little energy I have? That’s recursive logic.\n\nI don’t have any energy to begin with, and you want me to run a mile? Bullshit!\n\nSo since Rockstar doesn’t actually care about realism, let’s talk about a more grounded game:\n\nBreath of the Wild.\n\nIn this game, Link can trade four spirit orbs to increase his hearts or his stamina.\n\nBut I want to focus on this little guy, the Horned Statue.\n\nHere, you can do a different sort of trade… a devil’s bargain. You can increase your max stamina...\n\nYOU JUST HAVE TO GIVE UP SOME LIFE.\n\nThe only problem is that I can\'t figure out how I would gain more stamina\n\nby doing something physically detrimental, like using a shampoo with sulfates.\n\nI would never do that.\n\nSo for now, I’ll be focusing on the first three techniques.\n\nHere’s how the experiment will go: I will spend one day on each technique,\n\nrating my stamina level every hour of that day.\n\nIf I’m at a 0, then I’m either sleeping or dead, so most of my stamina levels will be between 1 and 10,\n\nwith a 1 being the stamina level of a hotboxed sloth,\n\nand a 10 being the energy of a 6-year-old at a laser tag party who just finished his first can of mello yello.\n\nMy goal is to be at a level 10 at all times.\n\nI’ll also be rating the boosts based on three criteria: Boost speed, Boost endurance, and Boost Quality.\n\nBut first, we have to do a control trial. Which is just a normal day.\n\n“Just after 7 o\'clock on a Monday. I\'d say my power level is at a 5. I\'m about to have some coffee."\n\nI went about my day as I normally do, which is to say, boringly.\n\nIf we take a look at this graph, you’ll see that there were two little spikes.\n\nThe first one, which happened after I had my morning coffee,\n\nand the second one after I hit a real low spot right after lunch.\n\nI have no idea if I’m pointing to the right places.\n\n“It\'s half past one. I decided to be productive by at least leaving my house.\n\nGonna go buy a liter of Monster.\n\nYou can\'t tell because I\'m wearing a mask, but I\'m grimacing under here."\n\nThis is obviously just one control trial,\n\nbut it is emblematic of the lethargy I’ve been feeling for the past few weeks.\n\nI never got above an 8, and in fact my average for the full day\n\nwas just a little bit higher than how I was feeling right after I woke up. That’s pretty bad.\n\nBut it means there\'s nowhere to go but up.\n\nAnd I’ll be going WAY UP with the first technique trial.\n\n“Feeling about a 5, not super tired, not super energetic.\n\nBut instead of making coffee, I instead will go and take a swig from my canteen,\n\nwhich I have filled up with three different Monster Energy drinks, up to the liter mark.\n\nIf I\'m at halfway through my stamina right now, I should be drinking 300 milliliters. Let\'s see if this kicks in!"\n\nAnd the effects of Sam Bridges’ favorite concoction did, indeed, kick in. "8 o\'clock!\n\nLet\'s, okay, obviously the energy drink has, uh, affected me. Let me put this down so I\n\ncan move around with my hands. I can still have more stamina. Yeah, I feel like I\'m at\n\nan 8 right now. You know normally I\'d say that that\'s fine. I\'m trying to be at the\n\npeak performance level. Another 120 milliliters down the hatch. Let\'s do some work, baby!\n\n*singing* Don\'t mind me, just gonna do some work right now. Feeling fine! Probably a 9.\n\nOr maybe a 9 and a half! Maybe a 10? Probably... I\'ll, mmm, 9 and a half. Can we get waffle\n\nfries? Does anyone deliver waffle fries? NO FILMING! Let\'s go write more scripts!" Things\n\nwere going great for me in the stamina department. Until they weren’t. *incoherent mumbling*\n\n"The crash, and then right after eating lunch has kind of... just brought the whole thing\n\ndown to a 3. Now that I have seen that Monster gives me a super high and then immediately\n\ncrashes me, I’m going to do the only thing a sane person would do, and consume more monster\n\nenergy. Let\'s go to work!” And though I went searching for that magnificent, full\n\nstamina feeling I fleetingly experienced in that morning, I still averaged less than the\n\ncontrol trial for the rest of the afternoon. I drank 3 full cans of Monster Energy.\n\n“If I hadn’t had the monster energy, would I have been dead right now? I don\'t understand.”\n\nThere was only one little spike that happened after I had to go outside to pick up steaks\n\nfor the next day’s trials, and though the energy drinks didn’t keep me up all night,\n\nthere were some other side effects, that ultimately led to a bad review of this technique. “My\n\nbody is tired, but my mind is just, there\'s some anxieties in there? And also I feel,\n\nlike, physically not great." Still I had high hopes for Trial 2. Since the previous two\n\ntrials trended downward, I had hoped that Slowing Depletion would help. Unfortunately,\n\ndue to the previous day’s trials, I was operating at a deficit. "Went to bed alright\n\nand then I woke up about 2 hours after that, and then kept waking up every 30 minutes.\n\nI\'ll tell you what, more than anything in the world, what I would love to do is go ahead\n\nand brew myself a pot of coffee, but you know what, I’ll do you one better.\n\nSuper cheap, beef eye-round steak.\n\nI’m gonna ahead and grill one of these puppies up to a healthy 160 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nLet’s get some breakfast going.”\n\nI tried my best to go into this experience unbiased, and honestly, the first steak of the day wasn’t that bad.\n\n“I feel more powerful."\n\nAnd though it didn’t give me quite the same bump as the Monster Energy,\n\nmy stamina levels rose and stayed level for the entire morning.\n\n“It feels like I\'m maintaining it a lot better.\n\nMaybe I really am not degrading my stamina. It is almost lunchtime.\n\nMaybe I\'ll eat two well-done medallions of steak."\n\nThat’s exactly what I did. Sadly, the second meats of the day were not as wonderful,\n\nand this is where the true challenge of this technique came in.\n\n“I do really wish I was eating something other than this.\n\nThe problem is that I\'m still very hungry, and... but I also don\'t want to eat any more well-done steaks.”\n\nWith my stomach rumbling and my stamina flagging, I decided to try to take my mind off it by\n\nworking on the accessories for the next day’s trials. And this did give me a little stamina boost,\n\nand that stamina maintained, but other things weren’t going so hot.\n\n“Great, stamina’s going alright, but I am so hungry,\n\nand also so upset with idea that I have to eat more of these well-done pucks of meat.\n\nBut I\'m gonna make the last two!\n\nNow a lot of you might be wondering, doesn’t it get easier over time?\n\nAnd the answer is obviously no.”\n\nBy the end of the day, it\'s easy to see that though my stamina didn\'t get quite as high,\n\nit did last longer, so there might be some truth to this slowing degradation technique.\n\nBut unlike the Monster Energy trial,\n\nthis one was both literally and metaphorically harder to swallow.\n\nThere’s a reason energy drinks aren’t chewable.\n\nLuckily, our final trial didn’t make me consume anything.\n\n“I slept a little bit better last night, at least, so I\'d say I\'m at, like, a 4.\n\nBut the goodnews is that I know just what to do. Let me go put on my accessories.\n\nI already feel energized.”\n\nOkay, full disclosure, as much as I believe video game logic,\n\nI did just tape some tin foil onto some cardboard.\n\nI wasn’t expecting much from this trial.\n\nBut the results speak for themselves.\n\n“Why don’t I carry around a shield more often!\n\nThis makes me feel so powerful!”\n\nI had a morning boost that rivaled Item Refills!\n\nSure, working in full garb was a little bit annoying,\n\nbut that didn’t stop me from being an active participant in my virtual meetings.\n\n"Yeah, I can, I can help out with that, Jenna, if you need any extra help on that one."\n\nJenna - "Yeah, Brian. I guess so."\n\nBut around 11, the mask and shield were getting to me,\n\nso I started altering which of the accessories I was wearing.\n\nThere’s no set bonus, so as long as I have one item equipped,\n\nmy stamina regeneration should be a little bit faster than normal.\n\n“For the past hour, I took off the mask, and I’ve just been living on the Chloranthy Ring.\n\nI do feel more tired. I\'m gonna rethink about the mask."\n\nAt 1:30, I had to do a stream, and I did that in the mask.\n\nAnd sure enough, my stamina was boosted after that experience.\n\nIn fact for most of the day, the accessories helped and didn’t make my stomach hurt,\n\nbut there were other costs.\n\n“I don’t like wearing this mask.\n\nI feel like my stamina has increased. But it seems like there\'s an obvious trade off going on here,\n\nbecause, like, it\'s not, it’s not comfortable to wear. You can see, like, it\'s been squishing my nose.\n\nI’m deciding whether or not I want to have higher energy levels or if I want to feel comfortable,\n\nis really what\'s happening at the moment."\n\nTake a look right there.\n\nI imagine that the Wright Brothers wore a similar expression the day they went to Kitty Hawk,\n\nbecause that is the face of a man who is ready to soar.\n\nRemember how I said I couldn’t figure out how to trade health for stamina?\n\nWell judging from these previous trials,\n\neach one of them was physically detrimental in a specific and wonderful way.\n\n"I feel, like, physically not great."\n\n"Why am I still so hungry?"\n\n"It\'s not comfortable to wear."\n\nPerhaps I could trade my health for more stamina by doing every technique at once.\n\nWelcome to The Final Trial!\n\n“Waking up this morning and realizing what I was going to have to do today\n\nreally just made me not want to get out of bed.\n\nI am about to do all three stamina things at once.\n\nI’m not expecting it to feel good, but I am expecting\n\nan increase in productivity unlike... anyone has ever seen from me.”\n\nSo after donning my outfit and grilling up a well-done steak,\n\nI sat down for breakfast.\n\n“God I hate this steak.”\n\nAnd by 9 o’clock, I felt the effects.\n\n“I think maybe god didn’t intend for us to wake up and drink an energy drink\n\nand eat a well-done steak and then wear a tin foil mask.\n\nI’m at a 5.”\n\nOkay, so the boost didn’t happen right away,\n\nbut let’s remember that some of these boosts take a while to warm up.\n\nAnd given the fact that I\'m increasing my max stamina,\n\nI should be hitting a 10, maybe an 11 or 12, by midmorning.\n\nExcept things didn’t change.\n\n“It\'s 10 o\'clock and I\'m still at a 5. What the hell?\n\nI\'m just gonna cook all the steaks, I\'m gonna drink all the energy drink, I\'m gonna wear this while I\'m doing it.\n\nI\'m just gonna do it all right now. I\'m tired of this. I\'m also physically tired."\n\nI ate four steaks.\n\nI drank all of the rest of my energy drink.\n\nI was GOING to increase my maximum stamina.\n\n“I’m ready to take on the day.”\n\n*pained moan*\n\nIt turns out that doing every single stamina boosting technique at once fills your stamina bar so full,\n\nthat the bar explodes.\n\nI felt physically ill and had to lie down for several hours.\n\nI can’t even review this boost technique because it just knocked me unconscious.\n\nBut I will say that I did rebound later that day.\n\n“So I left my house.\n\nCame out here to take a little walk while maintaining adequate social distance.\n\nI feel... I feel a WHOLE lot better.\n\nYou can\'t tell, but I\'m smiling under this."\n\nAnd this made me rethink some of my trials.\n\nMost of my afternoon boosts weren’t due to gimmicky ingestibles, they were because I took a small walk,\n\nor I did a fun craft, or I talked to my friends online.\n\nWas I doing these techniques for nothing?\n\nIs video game logic wrong?\n\nNo.\n\nI just didn\'t understand what video games were teaching me.\n\nGetting good at Dark Souls or Monster Hunter is about knowing how many swings of your big sword\n\nyou can do before you need to take a break.\n\nIt only becomes a major issue if you completely run out, and you have to spend a few seconds staggered,\n\nor spend a few hours lying in bed.\n\nMaybe the real stamina technique I need to learn is recognizing that, right now,\n\nI may not be able to do as much as I want to.\n\nBut if I focus on the little wins,\n\nI can manage my stamina, and I can manage my expectations for my stamina.\n\nSo although I may still wear the Chloranthy Ring, it will just be for the fashion.\n\nAnd today, I’m gonna take care of laundry chair.\n\nYou tell me when the camera stops rolling so I can stop folding.\n\n*SYNTH BANGER* ', ' WALUIGI.\n\nThe tall bastard man that Nintendo loves to disrespect. We know he\'s number one.\n\nBut who really is he? And where did he come from?\n\nAnd why hasn’t Nintendo given him his own game.\n\nThe cult following of Waluigi cannot be overstated. He is an icon.\n\nThe patron saint of weird content creators.\n\nBut isn’t it strange that this character so beloved by Nintendo fans\n\nseems to be completely disregarded by the company?\n\nI don’t believe that’s actually the truth.\n\nNintendo cares almost too much about their characters.\n\nThey rarely put a character into a game unless they\'re 100% sure it’s a good fit.\n\nAnd I think this is the reason why Waluigi has been sidelined:\n\nNintendo doesn’t know what Waluigi is all about.\n\nSo, Doug Bowser, I have collected every single piece of Waluigi lore into this one\n\nsimple video, and I’ll be presenting it to you, so you can finally make that Waluigi game.\n\nWahaha!\n\nThat was my first attempt, I\'ll get better.\n\nIn order to understand Waluigi perfectly,\n\nwe have to take a look at every appearance he\'s made in a Nintendo game.\n\nThey’re the only ones that count toward canon.\n\nIf you\'d like me to discuss Waluigi\'s noncanonical appearances, I can definitely do that for you, Doug,\n\nit\'ll just have to be in my off hours\n\nbecause it is DEFINITELY not safe for work.\n\nHere’s every Waluigi appearance sorted by release date.\n\nThese 63 games contain the entirety of Waluigi’s characterization.\n\nHe is playable in 50 of them, and we can split those playable games into Sports and Party Games.\n\nI combed through each of these appearances, grasping at any piece of Waluigi characterization,\n\nbut the vast majority of them treat Waluigi as a meat puppet. A space filler.\n\nAn extra body on the character select screen. And, honestly, that’s one way to see Waluigi.\n\nI hear you, Doug Bowser. Why should I care about a space filler character?\n\nWell, you already care about a space filler character.\n\nA little fella named Mario.\n\nLet’s discuss Waluigi’s counterparts to shed some light on his origin.\n\nThe original Donkey Kong was supposed to have Popeye characters, but Nintendo couldn’t get the license,\n\nso Shigeru Miyamoto created an unnamed player character as a stand in.\n\nAnd that space filler was later named Mario.\n\nPeople think that characters have to have some deep backstory in order for people\n\nto like them, but that’s NOT TRUE. People love Mario BECAUSE of his humble origins.\n\nThe same cannot be said about the rightfully despised coward boy that is Luigi.\n\nYou see, Luigi was made because they needed a player 2 in the game, so they just palette swapped Mario.\n\nThat is a character filling a space by copying another filled space.\n\nAs much as I hate to admit it, I will have to revisit Luigi later in this video,\n\nbecause he is key to developing the personality of Waluigi, and that\'s partially because of Wario.\n\nWario wasn’t made by Miyamoto. Supposedly, the team behind Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins\n\ndidn’t enjoy being forced to make a Mario game because they didn’t create the character.\n\nSo Hiroji Kiyotake created a bad Mario, someone that had all of Mario\'s evils exaggerated.\n\nAnd finally, we have Waluigi, who was created by the same character designer who worked on Golden Sun.\n\nThe guy who made Saturos and Isaac and all of these intense powerful characters\n\nused his talents to make the most intense, most powerful character.\n\nAnd he made him for a very important reason:\n\nbecause Wario didn’t have a doubles partner in Mario Tennis.\n\nIf Wario is just the evil exaggerated form of Mario, then Waluigi\'s the same for Luigi.\n\nAnd that’s really all we get from Waluigi’s first encounter.\n\nThat, and the fact that Luigi is not afraid of him.\n\n*Mario Tennis music plays*\n\n"Luigi not afraid."\n\nLuigi, the milksop who is afraid of all, is not afraid of his evil, funhouse mirror twin.\n\nThere’s something to that, but I don\'t know if I can quite grasp it without discussing all of the lore first.\n\nSo let’s switch back here.\n\nAs I mentioned before the tangent, Waluigi often plays the role of meat puppet,\n\nso not all of these games have lore that is useful to us in developing a Waluigi game.\n\nSo I’ll take them off the board.\n\nAfter cutting, we\'re left with 5 references to Waluigi, 7 party games, and 13 sports games.\n\nFrom these 25 appearances, we can take all the juicy morsels and put them into a list of Waluigi Truths.\n\nLet’s start with the references.\n\nThough Super Smash has notoriously snubbed our large purple child,\n\nthe trophies do a pretty good job of fleshing out his character.\n\nSuper Smash Bros. Melee lays out 8 Waluigi Truths in just three sentences:\n\nFour things right there: Tall. Thin. Evil looking. “Seems” to be Luigi’s rival.\n\nThat one isn’t really definitive, so we’ll keep it ambiguous.\n\nWaluigi is a mischief maker, and he takes it seriously.\n\nLuigi is exactly the same age as Waluigi, and I do not know who that reflects worse on.\n\nAlso, I love that Waluigi is connected to Wario, but no one\'s ever cared to take a closer look.\n\nAre they friends, accomplices,\n\nlovers?\n\nIt’s unclear!\n\nThe next Smash games really hammer home these truths,\n\nonly adding that he must also have a crooked mustache, a large nose, and a love of kicking.\n\nHmm.\n\n*crashing noise*\n\nThe final reference comes from Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle,\n\nwhere a large rabbid called Bwaluigi appears.\n\nThis is the closest Waluigi has ever come to appearing in a plot-based Mario game.\n\nA fucking rabbid has had more screen time than the original Waluigi.\n\nWhat can we learn from this?\n\nAs we move onto the party games, a lot of Waluigi’s lore is reiterated.\n\nThe main additions are that he is a misanthrope who loves to party.\n\nThere are two strange pieces of info in the party games.\n\nIn Mario Party 5, each pairing gets a different team name, and Mario plus Waluigi are “Psuedo Bros.”\n\nNot enemies.\n\nIt seems like Mario is okay working with Waluigi instead of Luigi.\n\nThe second weird piece of info is in Mario Party 4, where Waluigi is described with the quote:\n\n“That Waluigi\'s a serious sneak! Watch out for his Sparky Sticker..."\n\nThis quote doesn’t have any useful info for us, but the phrase “watch out for his sparky sticker”\n\nis the worst and I hate it and why’d you put it in a family friendly video game, Nintendo?\n\nFinally, we have the Sports games, where Waluigi started.\n\nMario Tennis set the tone for Waluigi with two truths.\n\nOne, that he’s highly skilled as a technique player. And two, that Luigi is not afraid of him.\n\nThis one\'s still weird to me.\n\nThese ones all have quotes that reiterate what we know about Waluigi.\n\nHe\'s hardworking and he\'s skilled, even if he cheats sometimes.\n\nWe have some metaphysical characterization in Super Mario Strikers, where the legend states\n\n“Waluigi\'s ego tends to be his biggest enemy.”\n\nIn Mario Hoops 3-on-3, his Baller Name is “The Question.”\n\nWhich I think just solidifies him as an enigma.\n\nMario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games shows that Waluigi is a great jumper,\n\nand Waluigi’s special move in Mario Super Sluggers is the Liar Ball, which is a ball that\n\nhe splits into two copies, one real and one false,\n\nwhich emphasizes his mischievousness.\n\nIn Mario Power Tennis, there is a blooper reel where Waluigi is aware that this is all a show.\n\nDoes this mean that Waluigi is able to break the fourth wall,\n\nor does it prove what I already knew,\n\nthat Waluigi is great on camera.\n\nIt\'s hot under these lights, anyone else hot in here? I\'m just gonna pop this bad boy off if that\'s okay.\n\n*crashing sound*\n\nAnd in Mario Tennis: Power Tour, Waluigi appears without Wario.\n\nTheir relationship was never clear, but it is surprising that Waluigi, who was built to be Wario’s tennis partner,\n\ncan appear in a tennis game without him.\n\nLuigi’s still there. Why can’t Waluigi exist without Luigi, save us all a headache.\n\nAnd that’s basically all of the Waluigi lore you can learn from the games. The 23 Waluigi Truths.\n\nAnd you can use them to create a Waluigi video game.\n\nAnd I could stop this video here, Doug,\n\nbut I’ll tell you what, I\'ll do you a favor.\n\nI\'ll tell you what I think the Waluigi game should look like, since I’ve done the research for ya.\n\nIf you’re gonna make a Waluigi game, you\'re gonna need to make it distinct.\n\nNintendo does a great job of tying gameplay to what makes a character special.\n\nMario’s got platformers locked. Wario has eccentric greedy microgames.\n\nLuigi...\n\nyou know what, let’s actually go through Luigi’s truths and see how it led to Luigi’s Mansion.\n\nLuigi is foolish, he\'s a coward, he\'s weak, he\'s pitiful.\n\nAnd you take these truths and you think, hmmm, what kind of setting would allow this mistake of\n\na human to really exhibit his uselessness?\n\nA haunted house!\n\nThis man has been bamboozled into comedic haunted house entrapment three times,\n\nsomething most Hollywood stooges have only been duped into once.\n\nHe’s a big dumb idiot, and I would HATE to be associated with him.\n\nBut Waluigi is Luigi’s twisted reflection, so his game will be far removed from this numpty.\n\nLet’s make it.\n\nFirst, we\'re gonna move the truths that are physical traits to the side, since they\'re baked into Waluigi.\n\nNext we have to decide on a cast of characters.\n\nHonestly, Waluigi has been sidelined for so long that this needs to be a solo mission.\n\nNow, let’s talk about the rest of these truths.\n\nIf you were to separate them out, you could probably make dozens of different games.\n\nA mischievous prank game. A, uh, game where Waluigi gets schwasty every night.\n\nAnd I’m not opposed to these games, but Waluigi contains multitudes.\n\nWhy does he turn to mischief? Why does he work so hard only to be cast aside by society?\n\nWho is this enigma of a man, whose true enemy is himself?\n\nThe Waluigi game, like the man,\n\nshould be a mystery.\n\nNintendo already has wonderful mystery games, but they’re too cute.\n\nWaluigi is raw. He\'s real. To convey the complex emotions of a complex man,\n\nwe can’t rely on traditional animation styles.\n\nThe Waluigi video game\n\nshould be Full Motion Video.\n\nDoug, I know this is a wild concept. Nintendo is not known for live action video mysteries,\n\nbut Waluigi is just the intellectual property to explore this new genre.\n\nImagine Waluigi as a hard-nosed investigator, struggling to pick apart the pieces of who he is.\n\nA man solving himself.\n\nI mean, there is the issue of casting.\n\nYou gotta find someone who’s evil looking, and has a crooked mustache,\n\nand a big nose and is great at jumping.\n\nAnd, you know, that\'s a... that\'s a hard task to find one guy who\'s got all those features, you know, I...\n\nWell now, wait a second, Doug.\n\nIf you take a look at my truths, you\'ll find that they\'re nearly the same as Waluigi\'s.\n\nI’m hard working, I’m a bit of a scamp, and though I might not be as tall and lean,\n\nthere’s enough of me that WANTS to be Waluigi that I’d devote everything to being him.\n\nI need this role, Doug.\n\nI’ve spent the past few months devising this pitch for you. No one wants this more,\n\ncares more about Waluigi than I do.\n\nI will fight Charles Martinet for this role.\n\nIs that what you want, Doug?\n\nYOU PICK THE WEAPONS.\n\nI WILL END HIS CAREER.\n\nAnd that’s why I hope you’ll consider me for Waluigi’s Currently Untitled Full Motion Video Game.\n\nBut there’s something that\'s still nagging at me.\n\nI’m sure you noticed that I didn’t address all of these Waluigi truths.\n\nWhy does every single quote state that Waluigi "thinks” he’s Luigi’s rival?\n\nYou could read this as Waluigi not being important enough for Luigi to consider him as a rival,\n\nbut why go through the trouble of putting that in EVERY SINGLE description?\n\nWhy not just make their rivalry canon?\n\nAnd the fact that Luigi is not afraid of him is mind boggling.\n\nLuigi’s personality is 90% fear and 10% being green.\n\nMario is shocked when Waluigi appears, and yet Luigi is calm,\n\nlike he somehow expected him.\n\nAnd if Waluigi thinks his biggest rival is Luigi, then how can his actual biggest enemy be his ego?\n\nDoes that make Luigi the ego to Waluigi\'s id? A-a-and if...\n\n"You can\'t have a Waluigi without a Luigi." "He splits into two copies, one real and one false."\n\n"Pseudo Bros. Not enemies." "Why can\'t Waluigi exist without Luigi?"\n\nLuigi and Waluigi are the same person.\n\n*Vesti la Giubba starts playing*\n\nIt’s so simple. Luigi is just manifesting his own repressed desires as an alternate personality,\n\na shocking twist that no one\'s ever done in media before.\n\nWaluigi is just the exaggerated form of Luigi’s deepest desires.\n\nThe want to be skilled. The want to be respected.\n\nThe want to PARTY.\n\nWaluigi is everything Luigi wishes he could be but could never be\n\nunder the famous gaze of his famous brother.\n\nWhat an amazing twist. What an amazing truth.\n\nWhat an amazing role for me as Waluigi.\n\nThink of the accolades, the game awards, the respect.\n\nAs someone who wished to be Waluigi for so many years!\n\nAs someone... who wished...\n\nIf there are two personalities, am I number one, or am I the one who is longing?\n\nOh god. I\'m not a Waluigi.\n\nI’m a Luigi.\n\nNo no no... Nonononononono!\n\n*mirror shatters*\n\n*shaver buzzes*\n\nAnd that’s just ONE potential ending to Waluigi’s Currently Untitled Full Motion Video Game.\n\nIf you’re interested in licensing the idea, Doug, feel free to reach out to my agent,\n\nand we can get filming tomorrow.\n\nOr in like… five months \'cause I am gonna have to grow the mustache back-\n\nI probably shouldn\'t have shaved it before we...\n\nYou know what, I don\'t have an agent, so just don\'t contact me.\n\nI don\'t want to play Luigi, so.\n\nPat- "Can you sob while doing it?" Brian - "Okay."\n\n*sobbing while shaving*\n\nPat - "Head back."\n\n*Brian gags and coughs* *Jenna and Pat laugh*\n\nBrian - It\'s so hard to sob while shaving because it gets in your mouth. ', ' I love the Legend of Zelda series.\n\nBut the canonical timeline doesn’t make any sense!\n\nPerhaps it would make more sense if someone tried to put every single piece of Zelda media,\n\ncanonical and noncanonical, into one timeline.\n\nSomeone should try to do that.\n\nLet’s go!\n\nLet’s start with the canonical timeline.\n\nSo we’ve got Skyward Sword at the very beginning.\n\nCreated Demise, and then he becomes Ganon later on.\n\nLink gets resurrected.\n\nIt’s Minish Cap.\n\nIt introduces Vaati.\n\nHe’s a wind sorcerer.\n\nAnd then he also shows up in Four Swords.\n\nThat comes next.\n\nAfter Four Swords, Vaati is sealed, Ganon’s back, baby!\n\nAnd it’s Ocarina of Time.\n\nSo Ocarina of Time splits into three different timelines here.\n\nIn one of them, Link decides to stay an adult, Ganondorf gets resurrected, and Link is nowhere\n\nto be found.\n\nAnd where’s Link?\n\nWhere’s Link?\n\nI’ll get to it, don’t worry, I’ll get to it.\n\nAnd then the whole world floods, and we get Wind Waker.\n\nThis one I’ll call “Adult Link.”\n\nIn this one, he decides to stay a child, the sacred realm is sealed, he’s finished his\n\nentire meaning of existence by the time he’s like 12, and so he goes and does Majora’s\n\nMask, which is also very existential.\n\nAnd then over here, Nintendo decided to make a timeline where Link loses.\n\nLink just can’t do it in this one.\n\nGanondorf does whatever the hell he wants to, and now it’s A Link to the Past.\n\nOne of my friends invited me over to watch him beat Ocarina of Time, because he was really\n\nclose to finishing it, and then I went over and then he couldn’t do it, and so then\n\nwe decided to go outside and play basketball.\n\nThis is that timeline.\n\nSo we have “Adult Link,” “Child Link,” “Basketball.”\n\nLet’s go back to “Adult Link.”\n\nAfter Wind Waker, he just goes and hangs out with pirate friends in Phantom Hourglass.\n\nWe go to Spirit Tracks.\n\nThis is on a different island, and technically there is Link and Zelda, except Link is really\n\ninto trains now.\n\nLet’s do the child one!\n\nWe go from Majora’s Mask into what is canonically called the Era of Twilight.\n\nObviously, it’s Twilight Princess next.\n\nThen it gets a little bit darker and goes into the Age of Shadow.\n\nWe do Four Swords Adventures, which is different from Four Swords.\n\nOne has Adventures in the title.\n\nHere’s some issues with canon over here in “Basketball” timeline.\n\nIn the Hyrule Historia, which came out in 2011, it states that next should be Oracle\n\nof Seasons and Oracle of Ages, but the Japanese Zelda website technically states that it goes\n\nLink to the Past, Link’s Awakening now.\n\nSo they’ve reversed those two.\n\nSo even the canonical timeline isn’t, like, super hard set-in-stone canonical, which goes\n\nto show that it sucks.\n\nHe does this thing and then he goes sailing and then he crashes and has a dream and then\n\ndies in the ocean.\n\nI’m gonna keep Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages tied together right now.\n\nA new Link, new cycle, and he goes A Link Between Worlds.\n\nAnd then it’s another existential crisis, but this is my favorite one because instead\n\nof having an existential crisis and then going to have to save the world from a moon, or\n\nhaving an existential crisis and hanging out with pirates, he just gets really into fashion\n\nin Tri Force Heroes, which is what I plan to do in my midlife crisis.\n\nIt’s The Legend of Zelda, the first one!\n\nZelda II: The Adventure of Link.\n\nThis is the same Link between these two.\n\nA cult wants to resurrect Ganon or something.\n\nWe’re at the most recent game, and the most recent in the timeline, it’s Breath of the Wild.\n\nYou might be wondering, where does Breath of the Wild fall?\n\nIn which timeline?\n\nIs it “Basketball,” is it “Child,” or is it “Adult?”\n\nWell guess what: IT’S ALL THREE.\n\nNINTENDO COULDN’T FIGURE IT OUT, SO THEY DECIDED TO JUST PUT IT IN ALL OF THE TIMELINES.\n\nWHICH ISN’T HOW TIME WORKS…\n\nTO MY KNOWLEDGE.\n\n*vague gesturing*\n\nI’m gonna make this timeline much worse, but I’m gonna also explain the convergence.\n\nSo what I’m gonna go to next is Zelda spinoff games.\n\nI’m not gonna talk about some specific things, namely cameos, or when you can buy Link’s\n\nclothing in other games, or some of the mangas because they’re just the same exact stories\n\nas some of the main canonical timeline games.\n\nI’ve wrapped all of these up.\n\nSome of them don’t have connections yet.\n\nDon’t worry, I’ll get to it.\n\nLet’s start with the easy Zelda spinoffs.\n\nThere were a lot of them during Twilight Princess.\n\nLink was also learning how to use his crossbow for big game hunting, and also it was Twilight\n\nPrincess Picross.\n\nMidna wanted to… she thought picross would help him…\n\nbeat Zant.\n\nWe’ll start from the beginning.\n\nSkyward Sword was supposed to be the first one, but they’re wrong.\n\nHylia chose her first hero, there was, like, a lot of time between the first hero and the\n\none that happened in Skyward Sword, and in that time was the Zelda Game & Watch.\n\nJust like in Skyward Sword, there was an upper level and a bottom level, and then there were\n\ndragons also in Skyward Sword.\n\nThat’s my logic behind this one.\n\nYou say “Zelda Game & Watch, what about the Zelda Game Watch?”\n\nThat’s right, the Nelsonic Zelda Game Watch.\n\nThis was a watch that you could play Zelda on, and there were only four dragons in this one.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the other Link already defeated the other ones!\n\nThere were three other dragons in Skyward Sword, and they were nice because they learned\n\nthat Link would fuck their shit up!\n\nLink: The Faces of Evil and Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon.\n\nI’m not an expert on this one because I’ve never played them.\n\nWhich I think is probably the best decision I’ve made in my life.\n\nRight over here, why?\n\nBecause in Link: The Faces of Evil he has to go to the island of Koridai.\n\nIslands?\n\nIn the great sea!\n\nObviously, that’s where they make sense to go.\n\nUh, Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon can go there, too.\n\nSQUADALA!\n\nBut that’s not the only CD-i game!\n\nThere’s also Zelda’s Adventure.\n\nGanon, I guess he stole some celestial something-or-others, and then it started the era of darkness.\n\nAnd remember what I said before about how it went to twilight and then to shadow?\n\nWhat comes after that?\n\nThat’s right it’s darkness, baby!\n\nY’all know about the Satellaview?\n\nIt was a weird thing for the SNES, or the Super Famicom because it was just in Japan.\n\nIt insisted on all of the Satellaview games including the letters BS.\n\nBS The Legend of Zelda: Kamigami no Triforce was just basically A Link to the Past, so\n\nI didn’t include it in this one.\n\nBut there are other BS Legend of Zelda games, and they’re weird because they don’t actually\n\ninclude Link.\n\nThey include these two characters that you could choose, and they technically part of\n\nthe Satellaview thing, so it wasn’t Link who was there, but… um…\n\nI’ll explain in a second.\n\nI cut one of the titles in half.\n\nClayton, we have to start over.\n\nA Link to the Past happens and then Link goes away on a journey into the water and then\n\nhe dies.\n\nWhat’s happening while Link goes on adventures is BS The Legend of Zelda.\n\nIt happens after that, during Link’s Awakening, when Link runs away, which is why those kids\n\nare the ones in this.\n\nAnd then after that it goes Link…\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Ancient Stone Tablets.\n\nAnd technically, since those kids are the ones that are in BS The Legend of Zelda, that\n\ntechnically means that they are an iteration of Link, and so BS-X: The Story of the Town\n\nWhose Name Was Stolen, which was a game that included those protagonists, but, um, didn’t\n\ninclude anything about Zelda, technically is still a Zelda game, so I included it in\n\nthis one.\n\nBarcode Battler II, you had to scan cards with a barcode and then you would have to\n\nbattle those enemies using it.\n\nA different retelling of the same story as A Link to the Past, just like looking at it\n\nfrom a different camera angle.\n\nTingle exists in actually two different timelines, and he also exists in every timeline, because\n\nTingle is, um, the perfect evolution of humanity.\n\nHe shows up in Majora’s Mask first, and he also shows up in Wind Waker.\n\nWe have an origin story for Tingle in Freshly Picked Tingle’s Rosy Rupeeland.\n\nHe starts to get the taste *mwah* I love rupees.\n\nAnd then he starts selling his maps to you in Majora’s Mask, but at the same time as\n\nRosy Rupeeland is the Dekisugi Tingle Pack, which was, uh, DSiWare, and it just basically\n\nwas like a calculator, and like a fortune teller or something.\n\nTingle’s Balloon Fight DS.\n\nThis happens at the same time as Wind Waker.\n\nOver here in “Basketball” timeline, we’ve got Ripened Tingle’s Balloon Trip of Love.\n\nI’m not gonna explain how it connects just yet, because I’ll do that later.\n\nIt’s the final Zelda spinoff.\n\nHyrule Warriors Definitive Edition, and I’m using the definitive edition because that’s\n\njust the collection of all of them, ‘cause there’s three different versions of this game.\n\nI’m gonna put Hyrule Warriors over here, and I’m gonna call this the TIME BREAK.\n\n*THE TIME BREAK*\n\nThey made three timelines already, so why can’t I make my own?\n\nHyrule Warriors is the second most important game in the entire timeline for how it ties\n\neverything together.\n\nHyrule Warriors.\n\nThink about that, Nintendo!\n\nYou made me care about Hyrule Warriors!\n\nBut we’re not done with Zelda games.\n\nWe’re gonna talk about Zelda character appearances.\n\nIf Miyamoto doesn’t, like, email me after this video goes up and say, “Brian, you’ve\n\ncracked the code!”\n\nI’m never gonna play another Zelda game ever again.\n\nThis whole goddamn suit is so tight, I feel like a Christmas ham.\n\nI haven’t connected these two right now, because in “Adult Link” timeline, Link\n\njust kinda slacks off, ‘cause he has, again, existential crisis.\n\nHe finished beating Ganon, what does he do for the rest of his life?\n\nI’ll tell you what he does: He go-karts, and he fights people…\n\nFOR SPORT.\n\nSuper Smash Bros. the original one, Mario Kart 8, and Soulcalibur II.\n\nGot nothing better to do, might as well go have fun, and you know what, I respect that,\n\nbut you did forget that Ganondorf got resurrected, and then the whole world flooded.\n\nSo that’s on your conscience.\n\nI imagine that Link still has, like, access to the Temple of Time, which is why in Super\n\nSmash Bros. Melee, it happens simultaneously in Ocarina of Time, because he can change\n\nhimself into Young Link, and also Ganondorf’s there, and I don’t know why he’s allowed\n\nto fight.\n\nI’ve put these three Super Smash Bros. after Hyrule Warriors in the TIME BREAK.\n\n*TIME BREAK*\n\nAnd while we’re hanging out in the time break…\n\nSonic’s here.\n\nSonic’s in the time break baby!\n\nI swear to god I’m not just using the time break as a catch-all, but it does work as\n\na catch-all.\n\nThere’s this weird-ass game for the Wii called Captain Rainbow.\n\nTechnically happens at the same time as Link’s Awakening because it includes Crazy Tracy,\n\nbut Link’s Awakening happens within Link’s dream, so that means that Captain Rainbow\n\nmight be happening within Crazy Tracy’s dream.\n\nSo it’s very much like Inception.\n\nAnd that means that Joseph Gordon Levitt exists in the Zelda timeline.\n\nThat’s a joke.\n\nJoseph Gordon Levitt doesn’t exist in any timeline.\n\nAnd these are also gonna come down here next to Ripened Tingle’s Balloon Trip of Love.\n\nWarioWare, all of them, and then Scribblenauts Unlimited.\n\nAnd again, I will explain that later.\n\nPhew, I’m getting too worked up about this.\n\nCanonical games, spin-offs, Zelda appearances in other games, what’s left?\n\nEvery other type of media.\n\nI swear to god if I get one “well actually…” comment.\n\nThat’s a lost cause, right?\n\nLet’s start with books.\n\nI mentioned before that Skyward Sword was not the first game and that Game & Watch was\n\nthe first game.\n\nBut it’s not the first instance of Zelda and Link.\n\nHimekawa’s Skyward Sword manga does include the origin of literally… it’s like the\n\nfirst Avatar, it’s the first Link, first Hylian chosen hero.\n\nFirst instance of Link.\n\nI really don’t know why Nintendo hasn’t included the choose-your-own-adventure books\n\nbecause they love to have things that have confusing timelines where Link could potentially\n\ndie in them, like in “Basketball” over there.\n\nThe Crystal Trap and The Shadow Prince happen canonically after the original Legend of Zelda\n\nand Zelda II.\n\nThere are, like, 11 or 12 or 18 different endings.\n\nStick with me here: you could win The Shadow Prince with high points or you could win The\n\nShadow Prince with lower points.\n\nThose are two separate timelines in my head.\n\nSo low points from The Shadow Prince, you go to the Valiant Comics, and now we’re\n\ngonna talk about TV.\n\nIf you win with high points, we go into The Legend of Zelda TV Series.\n\n“Aren’t I sweet?”\n\nAfter The Legend of Zelda TV Series, Captain N happens, and it’s weird because in this\n\none, the hero is a guy named Kevin.\n\nHe gets sucked into a television.\n\nCaptain N creates this potential option of being able to summon yourself into the game,\n\nwhich explains THESE THREE THINGS.\n\nI TOLD YOU I WOULD EXPLAIN THEM LATER!\n\nRipened Tingle’s Balloon Trip of Love starts with a dumb 35-year-old man who lives in his\n\nparents’ house and then he gets sucked into a book, and then he goes into Tingle’s land\n\nand he becomes Tingle.\n\nWarioWare shows that the Zelda games exist at the same time which is in Captain N, and\n\nalso Scribblenauts Unlimited is here, too!\n\nI haven’t necessarily figured that one out.\n\nBoard games!\n\nThere are Zelda board games, and they also deserve to be in the timeline.\n\nThe Legend of Zelda board game…\n\nThe Zelda board game happens if you die in The Crystal Trap, how does that sound?\n\nAlright?\n\nYou happy?\n\nBut what about Zelda Clue?\n\nThat’s…\n\nI guess, happens, uh, during the Super Smash Bros. time, right?\n\nBecause they’re having fun together, hanging out.\n\nZelda Chess!\n\n*exasperated look at the camera*\n\nThere’s no plotline in Zelda Chess.\n\nPut it in Ocarina of Time like everything else in this dumbass timeline.\n\nLet me double check that I’ve gotten everything…\n\nBut what about the TIME BREAK?\n\n*TIME BREAK*\n\nI told you that I would explain the time break, didn’t I?\n\nAnd I’m gonna explain it right now.\n\nWhy does no one understand the time break except for me, Brian David Gilbert?\n\nWhy am I the only scholar in time break studies?\n\nI’ll tell you why.\n\nHyrule Warriors Definitive Edition happens outside of the timeline entirely, similarly\n\nto Breath of the Wild.\n\nIt exists in all of the timelines because Ganondorf’s soul gets split into multiple\n\npieces that go into different timelines, and again, that’s in the story itself.\n\nLink figures out that there are multiple timelines in this time.\n\nAnd then he defeats the thing and he goes into existential crisis mode, just like over\n\nhere, and like over here, and like over there.\n\nBut what does he do when he knows that all of these timelines exist?\n\nHe goes and plays Super Smash Bros. with all of his friends in every single timeline.\n\nThat’s how Super Smash Bros.\n\nUltimate can exist, because it’s everyone, all the time, everywhere, and also Sonic!\n\nBut the time break still doesn’t fit in.\n\nIt’s still by itself over here, right?\n\nOkay, the time break doesn’t have a space.\n\nLink knows about every timeline, and he’s done hanging out with his friends here in\n\nthe time break, so what does he do?\n\nHe decides to settle down, get a real job.\n\nAnd what can he do better than anyone else?\n\nThat’s right, he knows every location in every timeline.\n\nI’m talking location, location, location.\n\nHE GETS HIS REAL ESTATE LICENSE.\n\nHe buys up every land, he consolidates every timeline and pushes it all into one space.\n\nHow does he do it?\n\nLEGEND OF ZELDA MONOPOLY.\n\nTHE MOST IMPORTANT LEGEND OF ZELDA GAME OF ALL TIME.\n\nTHE ONE THAT MAKES BREATH OF THE WILD MAKE SENSE.\n\nREGGIE: TAKE FUCKING NOTES.\n\nI JUST SAVED YOUR ASS WITH MONOPOLY.\n\nTHIS IS THE PIN THAT HOLDS THE ENTIRE ZELDA TIMELINE TOGETHER.\n\nYOU MADE ME USE MONOPOLY!\n\nThat’s the entire Zelda timeline, including 55 pieces\n\nof Zelda media.\n\nDon’t ask me to do this again.
