 2020-06-25 16:19:14,453 - DEBUG - file running: Bowser.

King Koopa.

The authoritarian turtle with a penchant for princess-napping.

His very name strikes fear into the heart of man and mushroom alike.

And he’s also pretty good at figure skating.

But when you focus on Bowser’s many attempts to put the Mushroom Kingdom under his rule,

you might forget that to order fuel his violent vanity projects,

he must put hundreds of henchmen into harm’s way.

And by harm’s way, I mean in front of Mario.

But me?

I never forget the troops.

And today I’m honoring those who have put their lives on the line for a megalomaniacal turtle.

Today, I’m presenting you with Bowser’s military hierarchy.

I can’t go any further than that, I’m sorry.

“But Brian,” I hear you ask, “Why does Bowser need a military hierarchy?”

And folks, I hear you.

I hear your questions constantly.

They come to me in my dreams like a prophet receiving visions from an angry god.

Bowser needs a military hierarchy because of the Geneva Conventions.

Y’all remember those things?

Those little rules that keep you from committing war crimes?

Look, I know Bowser is a bad dude, but I don’t think that Nintendo would actively create

a war criminal and then allow him to sit in the backseat of a go-kart with a baby.

This is thanks to how we define armed conflict.

I read through the entirety of the Geneva Conventions in order to find this information,

which turned out to be unnecessary because there is a far more succinct definition in

a far shorter paper.

But do I regret reading the Geneva Conventions?

Of course not.

Knowledge is its own reward.

And could I really call this an Unraveled if I didn’t spend a whole day reading 224

pages of dense legalese for no good reason?

Of course I couldn’t.

Of course I couldn’t…

If Bowser wants to keep his armed conflict above board, we need to codify his aggressions.

So this means his henchmen need to follow a command structure.

One that is not at all clear cut in the games.

All we need is a list of Bowser’s troops.

That’s where this book comes in!

It’s The Super Mario Bros. Encyclopedia.

The official listing of everything you could ever want to know about the 17 games in the

main series of Super Mario Bros.

The main series are just the platformers, none of the RPGs or spin offs.

But the silver lining to this means that I can spend a different Unraveled talking about those games.

Because God has cursed me for my hubris, and my work is never finished.

Of the 17 in the main series, I’m gonna cut these three games, because they don’t

have Bowser as the main antagonist.

And I’m also gonna include Super Mario Odyssey, because that came out after this book was published.

That leaves us with 15 games and 226 enemies.

I came to this number because I cut out the variants.

I cut out all of the shadow versions of Mario, the minigame enemies, the enemies that are

just machines, and Bowser’s fursonas.

Because those should never be exposed to the horrors of war.

Now I need to figure out how to structure this hierarchy.

I asked myself, is there an analogous military that is somewhat bloated, often antagonistic,

and seems to be the only thing that the leadership cares about funding?

Unfortunately, I couldn’t find any real life examples of this.

So I’m loosely basing it on the US military.

That means Bowser’s military **SMACK*** will be split up into branches based on which

henchmen work best together, and I’m also going to try to fit them alongside commissioned

officers and enlisted troops.

The standard command structure that’s found in most militaries.

Let’s start with the heads of state: Obviously, we have Bowser up at the top, the commander in chief.

His secretary of defense is gonna be Kamek,

with Kamella standing by as the National Security Council.

We’ve also got Bowser Jr. up here, but he’s not in a military role.

He’s actually Secretary of Transportation.

But that’s just pure nepotism.

The rest of Bowser’s henchmen are going to fit into this hierarchy, and I’m just

gonna say one henchman per rank, the one that epitomizes what that rank means.

And I’m gonna list the rest of the enemies on the screen.

Because I do want to save at least a little bit of paper.

Uh.

Obviously I don’t want to save paper that much.

*paper guilt*

Starting with our infantry, we have our enlisted ranks with Private Goomba.

This makes sense.

It is the basic troop.

Moving up a step to the corporal, we’ve got the Galoomba.

It’s more mature than the Goomba.

And also, its name has an extra syllable and is way more fun to yell.

Pat: Look at this Galoomba!

Brian: LOOK AT THIS GALOOMBA!

Chargin’ Chuck is a great pick for sergeant class, because this troop obviously enlisted

right after being their high school star quarterback and moved up through the ranks quickly.

And now that we’re up at warrant officer, the top of the enlisted ranks.

We’ve got, it’s just a tower of Goombas.

Kind of like the Naval Academy’s Herndon Monument, Goombas become stronger and work

together better when they’re standing on top of one another.

Moving our way up to the commissioned officers, we start out with officer cadet.

And that’s gonna be Twirlip.

It’s got the round, soft body of a day one ROTC recruit,

but there’s ambition in those eyes.

Second lieutenant, we’ve got the Snailicorn.

It’s the natural evolution from the officer cadet, but a bit more dangerous.

By the time you’ve reached First Lieutenant, you’ve really proved your mettle and are

ready to show your dedication to the cause.

And what better way to show your dedication than to be literally shot from a cannon.

By the time you reach captain, you need to have a top-down perspective.

And that's why the Pokey's height is great for this rank.

Also, the Pokey understands how to take calculated losses in stride, like having literally all

of their torso punched out from under them and still maintaining a smile.

Next we have Major Squizzard, and I’m gonna gloss over him, 'cause his name makes me uncomfortable.

For lieutenant colonel, I chose Wiggler, because they're able to maintain composure and only

release their aggression when it's absolutely necessary.

But quick shout out to Stairface Ogre, who is also a lieutenant colonel and sounds like

he could be a member of the Wu Tang Clan.

Next, we have Colonel Spike.

At the colonel rank, you’re not only dealing with wartime issues, but also the internal

politics of the military,

which is why Spike makes time to have a few rounds of tennis with the boss.

A Brigadier General needs an eye for detail and a strong guiding hand.

And that's literally all Knucklotec is.

Major Burrows really deserves the rank of major general because he has demonstrated

a powerful understanding of many strategies in many different battle arenas.

But more than that, he has this tender leadership quality that makes him not only respected,

but loved by his peers.

And then above him is a fucking T-Rex.

Unfortunately, even the military hierarchy is not insulated from nepotism.

And though no one would describe Petey Piranha as capable in literally any circumstance,

his father took a bullet for Bowser back in the Korean War, so now he’s a general.

And finally, we have our field marshall, the five-star general.

Obviously, this person is going to oversee every aspect of Bowser's infantry, and it

has to be filled with the most overpowered troop.

So it's Ukiki.

This shitheel of a monkey plays dumb, but he’s the Sun Tzu of Bowser’s army.

Listen to these quotes:

And that is the basic structure of Bowser’s infantry, though there are also three special

divisions of infantry units that are trained to fight in different conditions.

The Lava and the Ice divisions are still found under Field Marshal Ukiki and they don't have

any enlisted troops.

I won't talk too much about these two, but I think they are epitomized by the Bully for

the Lava group, and the Chill Bully for the ice group, who is exactly like the Bully,

except he'll kind of go easy on you if he can tell you're having a rough day.

And the third special unit in the infantry is the spectral unit, or the Dry Corps, because

not even death can excuse you from service in Bowser's army.

I do want to talk about the implications of this unit for a moment.

Specifically Dry Bones and Dry Bowser, whose naming conventions confuse and frighten me.

When I die, will I become Dry Brian?

Is a living Bowser...

Wet Bowser?

Why do Piranha Plant have bone in it?

Next we have our aquatic troops.

Where can you find pleasure, search the world for treasure, learn science technology?

Um.

Where can you begin to make your dreams all come true, on the land or on the sea?

*SINGING* IN THE NAVY!

I won’t overstay my welcome on the naval forces because we already understand what

each of the ranks in the hierarchy entail.

But I did just want to point out one troop.

The Gushen.

Because its name is the Gushen.

And I had to learn that its name was the Gushen.

And now you need to know that it's called a Gushen as well.

And of course, the admiral of the fleet is going to be Unagi.

Because Unagi is the most terrifying character ever rendered.

Get fucked, Mr. X.

Now on to the Air Force, we start with the Paragoomba at our lowest rank.

And honestly, we're gonna skip ahead to wing commander, because most of the Air Force is

just infantry but with wings attached.

Lakitu is our wing commander.

You might remember him as that helpful guy who picks you up in Mario Kart.

But he actually got his start in carpet bombing.

And it might seem redundant to have Klepto as the marshal of the Air Force.

But if there's one strategy that Bowser's military understands better than anything else,

it's stealing hats.

And these are the branches of Bowser’s military.

Of course, there are also Special Forces.

Units that Bowser can send in when he needs something to be done quietly and cleanly.

Like when the he sent the Broodals to perform the extrajudicial killing of Professor E. Gadd.

Next we've got the Bros.

I'm talking the Hammer Bro, the Fire Bro, every bro in between.

You can learn more about them in the HBO series, Band of Brothers.

I assume.

I've never watched the show.

It’s time for the special forces called The Funny Parade!

It’s the Funny Parade!

You know about Thwomps, but did you know that there are Thwimps?

And the Whomps have Whimps?

Thwimps and Thwomps and Whimps and Whomps and Grindels and Spindels and Grrrols.

There's Tox Box and Flomps and Rhomps and Bomps and Walleyes and Wallops and

they're all pretty much invincible and they will crush you without hesitation

like a cartoonish Sherman’s March to the Sea.

Next, we've got the Koopalings.

They're sort of like the Seal Team 6 of Bowser's army.

Iggy, Larry, Lemmy, Roy, Wendy O., Ludwig Von.

Notice that I did not include Morton Koopa Jr., because despite what he has written in

his memoirs, he's never actually been active duty, and he’s a valor stealing bastard.

And the final special forces team.

It’s the Stus.

Strollin’ Stu (strollin' stu).

Soarin’ Stu (soarin' stu).

Swipin' Stu (swipin' stu).

Smolderin’ Stu (smolderin' stu).

*Pat laughs offscreen.*

I don’t know if they’re good at fighting

but they are good at being the best fucking characters in Mario.

And that is every troop in Bowser’s military.

Except for these six specific ones.

They didn't really fit in the military structure.

They don't act like military.

The Koopa Troopas from Super Mario 64, they don’t even antagonize you.

Like, they go about their business unless you go out of your way to attack them.

So, again, they don't even, like, feel like military.

Uh, they act more like civilians, to be honest.

*realizing an unfortunate truth*

Oh my god, they’re civilians.

Okay, so maybe reading the full Geneva Conventions wasn’t such an unnecessary thing after all.

There’s this thing called the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, and in

Article 8 Subsection 2, it states that grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions

count as war crimes.

And if these Koopa Troopas are in fact not Troopas, but civilians, and Mario kills them,

then that is a direct violation of Article 8 Part 2, subsection B, 1: (i) Intentionally

directing attacks at the civilian population...

Mario is a war criminal.

But that’s not the only breach, God no.

Subsection A 4: Extensive destruction and appropriation of property.

Destroying a brick to gain a coin.

Subsection A 5, Compelling a prisoner of war... to serve in the forces of a hostile Power.

What else could you call using Cappy to possess enemies

and then forcing them to fire on their own friends?

Subsection A 8, Taking of hostages.

What was Mario doing with that penguin child?

You might think, hey, maybe Mario's just become hardened after years of onslaught

by Bowser, but LOOK BACK TO MARIO’S YOUTH!

I know I didn’t include Yoshi’s Island in these lists of games, but Subsection B, 21:

Committing outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment.

Yoshi made Burt the Bashful’s pants fall down!

But Baby Mario gave the order.

He already feels bashful!

You didn't need to pants the man!

Mario has committed at least 5 war crimes,

and I’m not even including the child soldiers he has enlisted in the RPGs.

But luckily, I’ve already compiled an extensive PDF that I have just emailed to the Hague,

outlining Mario's crimes.

Still, it’s important to note that Bowser is also at fault.

The great loss of Goomba life is a tragedy, no matter which side you are on.

The true enemy is war itself.

And to fix that, we have to turn to the only thing that’s worked in the past.

Song.

One more time everyone!

We are the Toads.

We are the goombas.

So please stop jumping on each other, ya big Galoombas!

Why do we fight to take each others’ space, when there’s so mushroom to spare.

We could all have extra lives if we just share. 
 2020-06-25 16:19:14,454 - DEBUG - file running:  CASTLEVANIA!

One of my favorite game series of all time.

The myriad enemies you face in Dracula’s abode are made even better knowing that they

come from real mythology and folklore.

Wouldn’t it be nice if there was one place you could find the FULL BESTIARY of EVERY

MONSTER in Castlevania?

I think that would be nice.

OR AT LEAST I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE.

I swear to god, the first time I started filming this video, I thought it would be an easy

change of pace.

I mean, how many unique enemies could there really be in Castlevania?

100?

200?

How about more than 600.

So I booked 3 hours in this studio to film.

And then we ran out of time about halfway through.

So I went out to grab some lunch, but it start to rain, so I ate a chicken sandwich drenched.

That has nothing to do with the video, I just wanted you to know my pain.

So I had to start filming all over again, this time after hours in a random meeting

room in our office building.

And when I finished that, I had three and a half hours of footage that I was able to

whittle down into an hour long video that was very educational and extremely entertaining.

JUST KIDDING.

IT WAS BORING AS HELL.

But just when all hope seemed lost, I had an epiphany.

“I am going to throw myself into the sea.”

Luckily, before I could do that, my coworkers stopped me and convinced me that trying to

categorize all 600 Castlevania monsters was a bad idea, and instead, I could just pick the hot one.

Ask yourself, why are vampires always the hot monster?

Isn’t it someone else’s turn?

I’m here to answer that question now that I’m filming this video for the third time.

Be thankful that I’m not releasing an hour long video of me basically just lecturing

you on mythology.

I mean, who knows, maybe I’ll release that video some other time.

THAT WAS A JOKE.

I’M NOT GONNA DO THAT.

YOU’RE GONNA HAVE TO TRUST ME.

IT WAS A REALLY BAD VIDEO.

SO LET’S FIND CASTLEVANIA’S MOST ELIGIBLE BACHELOR!

*hot music*

*lonely squeaking*

Let’s cull down that list of over 600 enemies.

We’re gonna start by smooshing all of the ones with common mythologies into just one

enemy, so that way we don’t have to deal with the 96 different skeletons.

We're also going to go ahead and cut out the evil human beings, and that includes the Belmonts that

you fight as enemies, and also all of the vampires.

We all know that Dracula is hot.

We all know that Richter Belmont is hot.

I’m also going to go ahead and cut all of the enemies from Boku Dracula Kun, which was

just a spinoff series, and Getsu Fuma Den enemies, which only appeared in one stage

in Castlevania Harmony of Despair.

And now it’s time to cut the animals, mythical or otherwise.

Look, if they’re anthropomorphized sure, but for things like “Owl,” that’s not

a monster, that’s a bird.

What about ephemera like will o’ the wisps, or inanimate objects made animate, kind of

like golems or marionettes.

I went back and forth on whether or not to include these, and then I realized they creep

me out, so I cut them.

Now I’m going to cut out all of the gods and the god servants and the embodiments of

things like chaos and evil, because those are inherently unique.

I'm gonna cull this list a little bit more, because, let’s be honest, vampires aren’t the only monsters

that have had a taste *kiss* of that sexy limelight.

Witches and warlocks, zombie, orc, treant, werewolf, mermen, gargoyle, gremlin, ghosts,

Medusa, cyclops, yeti, fox archer, ogres, stained glass knight, from Young Sherlock

Holmes, where he appeared as the first photorealistic CGI in any movie back in 1985.

And finally, mummies, Brendan Fraser.

Wasn’t the mummy in the film, but he’s sexy enough that just by association.

But we’ve culled it down to the perfect number to figure out our sexy monster.

That’s right.

We’ve got 69 left.

Can I get a WOOP?

Patrick: Woo!

Clayton: woo.

We’ll work on it, Clayton.

Criteria for what makes a sexy monster: Number one, is it replicable.

I’ve already explained this, it can’t be a unique monster.

Anything unique can be sexy.

Look at Benedict Cumberbatch.

Number two, is it datable?

Can you have a conversation with this monster?

Can you bring it to Applebee’s?

And number three, can this monster…

GET IT?

We're gonna start with the viable ones that probably aren’t the best sex icons, like Mimic, which

is kind of a veiny blob.

The Two Headed Creature.

Part cyclops, part werewolf, all bad.

Wight, W.I.G.H.T.

comes from the old English term meaning human being.

It’s like a… just a blue zombie.

Necromancers…

I don’t know, they’re into weird shit.

Spriggans come from Cornish faery lore, and they are described as old, wizened men with

huge childlike heads, uh, which someone’s into, I’m sure.

Nominon is a beast that, like, sucks the dreams out of your brains.

And that’s not a very supportive partner.

Punaguchi is just a large protruding mouth.

I don’t want to know what that mouth do.

The Maneating Plant, the Wakwak Tree, and the Human Face Tree are all plants.

So if you would want to make the monster sexy, it would just… it’s just a plant.

The rug creature.

Uh, you never actually see what it is, it’s just always under the rug.

Which means it’s probably just like a cat.

Hearteater.

If you’re into bad boys.

Castlevania has some of the best design in any pixel art game, except for the Towers Guardian.

I don’t know what the hell this is.

A ghoul isn’t necessarily a zombie, it is something that eats corpses, which is just gross.

This one’s for the sapiosexuals out there… the Brain Float.

Alastor: you should be wary of anyone who builds their personality around swords.

Elementals are just embodiments of fire and frost.

Just hard to cuddle with.

The Legend of Zeldo.

It’s just a person with scythes.

They are also known by the name “the Night Stalker,” which is a big red flag.

The Kyoma Demon hangs out in mirrors and jumps out and scares you, uh, and I don’t need

anymore reason to be afraid of looking at myself in the mirror.

*pensive music*

Man Beast comes in two forms: twink and twunk.

They say that eye contact is important.

But maybe not this much.

I do think we need a sexy skeleton, and the epitome of skeleton in this game is Yorick.

Yorick comes from Hamlet, the famous soliloquy “Alas, poor Yorick.”

In the Japanese version, he isn’t called Yorick, he’s called Soccer Boy.

The Imp is a mischievous sprite.

And I was a bit worried about size differentials, but then I remembered Bee Movie, where a human

woman falls in love with a bee.

Jerry Seinfeld taught me that through love all things are possible.

Trolls.

It’s time for someone to give them the love they deserve.

The next monster is Evil Force.

And I want you to just go ahead and wipe away all preconceived notions.

Obviously, the name makes it sound bad.

Uh.

It also is terrible.

(Pat laughs off camera).

Edimmu are Mesopotamian demons that come back from the dead when they weren’t buried correctly,

which seems like super high maintenance.

The Slaughterer apparently skips leg day.

The Arthroverta.

Just a human face plastered on top of, like, an arthropod. I dunno, maybe?

Chon Chon, or the Bitterfly, comes from Chile.

It’s about Mapuche wizards that turn into this thing.

Kind of like vampires turning into bats.

It’s a neat talent.

*revealing my true Chon Chon form*

The Killer Mantle.

Comes from an urban legend in Japan about Aka Manto, which is a spirit that lives in

toilets and then asks you if you want red or blue toilet paper.

Red, they’ll stab you in the back a bunch, and blue, they’ll strangle you till you

turn blue.

I’m just not into toilet stuff.

I mean most of these monsters are pretty okay.

Um, they’re not the… they’re not like the most.

SURPRISE!

I LULLED YOU INTO A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY!

It’s time for a minigame I like to call, “If I were a Castlevania game... what title

would I be?”

Take your birth month, and that’s the first part of the title.

OF.

And your birth date is the second part.

My title would be Castlevania: Sonata of the Eclipse.

All of these games sound the same.

We’re halfway through the viable enemies.

We’ve got 35 monsters that I think are pretty good options.

We’re gonna start with the monsters that are supposed to be sexy, so it feels kind

of unfair to use them as the sexy monsters.

Lorelai, Lilith, and all of the succubi, Harpys, Headhunter, Arachnes, Dryads, Rusalka, and Naiads.

I’m just putting these ones all around the sides.

The demons.

The ones with the horns and the wings and they’re really ripped and muscular.

Mothman.

Everyone thinks the Mothman is pretty sexy.

Although this Jersey Devil depiction looks just kind of like a horse with wings, uh,

the actual Jersey Devil comes from an idea of a woman who cursed her 13th child, being like,

“UGH GOD I GOTTA HAVE ANOTHER BABY.”

And then it came out and it grew like a goat’s face and wings, and I just think we need to

start thinking of New Jersey in general as sexier.

And this might be the way to do that.

The Minotaur.

You gotta work through that labyrinth, but once you get in there and find the real Minotaur,

he might kill you.

But, he also might open up and be really lovely.

The Chupacabra is an impish little fella.

First sighted in Puerto Rico and is known throughout lots of Latin America.

His name translates to goat sucker.

Do I have to explain why...

The Fomorians are personifications of chaos and other evil ideas in Irish folklore.

Um, and they're these goat people, uh, and they're ripped as hell.

Lizard Man.

If you don't know why I'm putting this here.

*COME ON*

You gotta go what my Skyrim video.

Banshee comes from Irish folklore and will foretell the death of someone you know.

It's a bit spooky.

It's also super emotionally available.

You won't have to worry about what the Banshee is thinking.

They will tell you when they're upset.

And also when your parents are gonna die.

Slogra.

Doesn't have a folklore or mythology associated with it.

I got nothing for ya.

If you're not attracted to this, you're wrong.

Because the Rycuda only exists in Castlevania, it means that there's... very specific artwork

that you can find of it.

Very modern artwork has been made about the Rycuda, which proves it can be sexy.

Dullahan is an Irish faery that is like a headless horseman sort of character, it's

also another portent of death, but can you think about all the cool Spider-Man kisses

you can do with that?

The Jiang Shi is the Qing dynasty version of a vampire.

Keremet comes out when you bang on his pot a couple times.

It's a good face, right?

I could talk to that thing for hours.

There are so many armors in Castlevania.

No one can turn down a man in uniform.

Or a poltergeist in uniform.

Or literally just an enchanted uniform.

UGHHHHHHH MOTHER OF PEARL I forgot about goblins.

Everyone forgets about goblins though, so I'll put 'em over here!

I also forgot about Siren, that's another thing that's sexy and draws people in.

How did I skip so many of these?

The Guillotiner doesn't look like much, could be a problem, but it's time for us to bring it back.

Slime.

There are already things online.

The Tsuchinoko is a Japanese cryptid that is a snake that is fatter in its middle than

on its head or its tail.

Pat (off camera): I just don't see why it's sexy.

You don't...

Patrick, you gotta understand.

It's not about what you could first see, right?

Pat: I mean, but even after that, what do you see after that?

It has a propensity for lying and for drinking alcohol.

Patrick thinks it shouldn't be this high on the list, but fuck Patrick.

We're at the top five.

But before we get there, um, I have a confession to make.

I've kept six monsters that don't even fit my criteria, but I love them so much that

I think they deserve a chance.

First up is a unique character, it's Nergal Meslamstea.

The reason I think he deserves a chance is because is because someone named him Nergal

Meslamstea.

Of course he's gonna be fucking evil if you name your child...

Why, what is up with people in Castlevania naming their children dumb shit?

Seriously, Alucard?

Dracula, you can't just name your child your name backwards.

I'm not gonna name my son Nairb.

Scary Candle.

It's an inanimate object that is made animate, but I fucking love candles.

Next two I think are pretty self explanatory: Bone Pillar.

And if that doesn't make you happy, how 'bout the Bone Dragon?

This next one is a ghost, and I've already explained why that one shouldn't be included

in this, but I had to because the ghost's name is Duke Mirage.

And if someone comes up to me and introduces themself to me as Duke Mirage,

my pants are already off.

Finally, I know I nixed all animals.

But I really do think we should include Hyena with gun.

That hyena can GET IT.

We're at the top five.

The Malebranche come from Dante's Divine Comedy.

They're all unique demons that are used to help keep corrupt politicians under boiling

pits of tar in Hell.

They all have great names like Cagnazzo and Scarmiglione, which was translated into the

English version as Skull Millione, which is just a Soundcloud rapper.

They're already mischievous, and they hate corrupt politicians.

We can get behind that.

The Myconid is a sentient race of mushroom people.

We have anthropomorphized animalia, why not anthropomorphized fungi?

When I was a kid, my mom thought that I had a nutritional deficit because I kept wanting

to eat mushrooms so much, like I ate only mushrooms for like a whole week.

That has nothing to do with this.

I know I took out all of the werewolf creatures, uh, but this one isn't that.

This is the Princess of Moss.

The human version is based off of

PFBRRRRRRRR UHM OFF WITH THE-ERRR Let them eat cake?

(Pat: Mary Antoinette) Mary Antoinette.

I think we should have more moth creatures in our movies.

Right?

They're already drawn towards the limelight.

It's an Ukoback.

Why is this the second sexiest monster from Castlevania?

I'll tell you why.

He carries around a hot thing of coals in a spoon, and is also responsible not only

for fried foods, but fireworks.

HELL YES.

What a cool dude!

I think Ukobacks could be real sexy, right?

What is more sexy than feeding someone with a lovely fried dish?

And finally, the thing that I think should be new sexy monster.

The Mandrake.

Or the Alura Une.

Basically, any sort of plant person.

Alura Une actually comes from a 1911 book called "Alraune."

It's a German story.

I just think that this kind of gives you a blank slate on something, sure this, this

thing is born from the ground where hanged men bleed, which is spooky, and scary, but

it's not their fault!

Right?

You know, they didn't choose to be born.

Who does choose to be born?

Right?

Who chooses...

The metaphors of how our family raises us, you know, the mandrake is a perfect idea of

something that can become greater than its original circumstances.

*SIGH* So there you go.

The full bestiary of the sexy monsters.

Again, couldn't give you the full full bestiary, because that took me way too long.

And if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw myself into the ocean now.

I CAN'T DO THAT.

I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE COLD BUT I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS GOING TO BE THAT COLD.

 2020-06-25 16:19:14,454 - DEBUG - file running:  Welcome to Unraveled Season 2!

You can tell it’s a new season because I’ve grown a mustache and cut my hair.

Ohoho I’m obviously just kidding.

These are both fake.

I know how much it would disappoint my friends if I changed my appearance.

I'm just kidding again.

I'm not your friend, and you have no say over what I do with my body.

And speaking of harsh realities...

The world of Dark Souls is frightening and murky.

How can you truly understand Dark Souls lore without living Dark Souls?

Grinding away tirelessly in inhospitable environments, under uncharitable overlords.

To truly understand Dark Souls lore, you must first understand the desolation of…

Working at a job!

Have you ever thought about the term Boss in a video game before?

Those terrible enemies have the same title as the people you’ll be working for

for the rest of your life!

Haha, what a silly coincidence!

Dark Souls is known for wildly difficult bosses that prove themselves on the battlefield,

but can they prove themselves in a more difficult setting:

the Lordran Hills Business Park and Commerce Center!

It’s across from the mall.

Today, I’m ranking every Dark Souls boss based on how good they’d be as a manager.

I'm not dancing this season.

Welcome to the Dark Souls Corp. onboarding seminar.

Now I'm only going to be speaking about the Dark Souls 1, 2, and 3 bosses.

No other “Soulsborne” games.

I was originally thinking about putting in the Demon's Souls, but they actually got integrated

into the Dark Corporation in a very messy merger.

All of the managers got sacked.

So we're not talking about them.

That leaves us with 96 Dark Souls bosses and minibosses.

And it leads us to the difficult part of our journey, how do we objectively answer the

subjective question: “What makes a good boss?”

So I started researching lists of “the x qualities of a good boss” on places like

LinkedIn and Forbes, and then I fell down the rabbit hole of the hundreds of corporate blogs.

And at the end of this journey, I realized... it didn't matter at all.

What does matter is making a catchy, powerpointable mnemonic device.

So here are the Five Cs that make a good boss:

Number one, clear vision.

Can this boss communicate their goals, give clear steps on how to achieve those goals.

Does this boss clearly hold their big old arm way up in the air before slamming it down on you?

Number two, consistent feedback.

It’s important for a boss to let you know that you’ve made a mistake, like challenging

Seath the Scaleless before putting on your ring of sacrifice, you absolute fool.

You child.

Number three, cherishes employees.

A good boss values employee perspectives and rewards good performance.

Like when a boss decides to die when you hit it in a good way.

Number four, compassionate leadership.

Honest. Trusting.

Worthy of respect from their employees.

The kind of boss you could chat with at the Estus cooler.

And the fifth and final C. Can really just go to town on a motherfucker.

Slices.

Dices.

Big old crunchers.

Someone who’s willing to do what needs to be done when the going gets tough.

Or someone who reveals an abyssal dragon that they’ve been keeping under their armor this whole time.

This is our main criteria for what makes a good boss.

But for 96 bosses, it's gonna be hard to differentiate their management style with just these five Cs.

Which is why I’m introducing the HR index.

If they're over here, they get a lot of HR compliments.

If they're down here, they get a lot of HR complaints.

Let’s be honest, some really well-loved bosses are very bad leaders, and some really good leaders

are SKEEZY AS HELL.

So let's rank some DARK SOULS BOOOOOSSEEEEEEEEES.

Here's our scale.

We're gonna start out with the neutrals.

They're the standard boss, so I'm just gonna skim through them.

Guardian Dragon, The Pursuer, Old Demon King, Demon of Song.

If you're watching this video and you see yourself exhibiting these lackluster tendencies,

I want you to ask yourself: What can I do to be better than the Royal Rat Authority,

who vomits acid all over the floor multiple times a day and is still considered a pretty

okay boss.

Aim higher.

Let's talk about the pushovers!

Now, these are like my favorite substitute teacher in high school, Mr. S,

who would go off on class-long tangents about his youth traveling the world

instead of teaching us about Lord of the Flies.

I loved Mr. S.

Objectively a terrible teacher, though.

Champion's Gravetender and Gravetender Greatwolf.

This guy’s so fun!

He brought his dog into work!

I love dogs!

Literally nothing's going to get done today.

Vordt of the Boreal Valley.

He runs around on all fours.

He's really disrupting the “walking” space.

It’s very ineffective.

Iron Golem.

He’s sweet, sort of bumbling, and you’ve asked him to approve your expense reports

like five times already.

Aava, Lud, and Zallen, the King's Pets.

Literally baked into the title, they're teacher's pets.

They suck up to the king.

Seath the Scaleless is a real sweetheart, but he is very risk averse.

And if you destroy his crystal, he becomes mortal, and takes it, like, really personally.

The Fume Knight.

He’s got two sides, two swords.

Look, he's still got his old sword back when he had your job.

But eventually he is gonna get rid of that sword.

He's gonna be a real asshole about it.

The Lost Sinner.

She, and I quote, “eternally punishes herself for the sins of her past.”

It’s important to have a boss that recognizes their flaws, but it's bad if your boss locks

herself in the conference room and flogs herself eternally.

I booked the conference room for three, I need to get in there.

Crossbreed Priscilla goes invisible at the first sign of conflict.

That's not showing up for the company.

Lorian and Lothric the princes.

One of them hangs around the other one's neck of the other one, who's actually doing all the work.

Which is the worst form of micromanaging.

The Four Kings.

You don't fight all four at once.

You fight one and then the rest come in slowly.

Which is kind of like every group project you had in high school.

The Carthus Sand Worm.

If you ignore them, they'll ignore you, and some people like that managing style.

But also if you stand on the sideline for long enough, someone else will shoot big arrows

into them and then they'll die.

And that's a bad boss.

The Dragonslayer Armour is actually just a puppet for these big wiry dragon butterfly things.

So they're well-loved by the higher ups, but only because they don't have any ideas on their own.

The Ancient Wyvern is the epitome of pushover.

Because you can just run through his stage and then kill him with one attack at the very end.

This is perfect for the employee that likes to, you know, fuck around on Reddit all day

and then send one email at five and then peace out.

I don't know what that's like.

I've never done that.

And finally, this is sort of a technical pushover.

It's the Ruin Sentinels.

They're kind of like a board of directors in that they all look the same and do the

same thing, which is to say not a lot.

But you gotta suck up to them if you want to get anywhere in the company.

Now we're gonna flip to the opposite side of the scale.

We're gonna talk about the sketchies.

These have a powerful understanding of corporate leadership...

but everyone hates them.

The Boreal Outrider Knight is a miniboss, but like, you can tell he really wants to be a boss.

Nashandra tricks you into opening the Throne of Want even though she just wants it for herself.

But manipulation gets you pretty far in business.

The Burnt Ivory King only comes to fight you after you kill literally all of his knights.

He gets it done, sure, but only when he needs to.

Dragonrider.

This dude doesn't have a dragon.

His job title is obviously false.

It's like if I got promoted to "Guy who had an okay time in high school."

Bed of Chaos.

Actually a very effective leader, but every time you have to have

a "Meeting with the Bed of Chaos,"

someone in HR gets an email.

Centipede Demon.

He nasty.

Manus, the Father of the Abyss.

Always screaming at me.

Bad anger management.

High Lord Wolnir has a lot of gold jewelry.

Very ostentatious.

All of his plans sound more like schemes,

BUT!

He does know the bassist for Maroon 5 and they've been looking for someone with like

really good hand dexterity and he's noticed that you've got something good so if you want...

Mytha, the Baneful Queen doesn't really have an understanding of personal boundaries.

She's kind of like that coworker who, instead of sending an email,

just peeks their head over the cubicle wall.

Except in this case that head is severed from the body and will explode.

Pinwheel can summon an unlimited amount of clones.

Most bosses wish they could be everywhere at once.

This one can be.

Slave Knight Gael came into the company with you, was a really good friend, and then he

got promoted over you, and he's been a real jerk since.

Aldia, Scholar of the First Sin is constantly testing you, because he sees great things in you.

But dude, not everything has to be a test.

This is a Game Stop.

Aldrich, Devourer of Gods has a bunch of skeletons strewn about his clothes, and those are the

people he ate on his way to the top.

Which is incredibly cutthroat, but at least he’s honest about it.

Pontiff Sulyvahn has two swords: a profane flame and a sword of judgment.

And he hits you with both of them.

He's the type of guy who sends you an NSFW link at work

and then reports you for clicking on it.

Dragon Slayer Ornstein and Executioner Smough get shit DONE.

They are a power couple...

that isn't sanctioned by HR.

They didn't fill out the paperwork.

It makes everyone very uncomfortable.

There is a LOT of PDA.

And it is weird.

Now let's move on to the good category, with the Old Dragonsl...

THIS IS JUST ORNSTEIN AGAIN.

THIS DUDE JUST PUT ON A DIFFERENT SUIT AND TRIED TO GET REHIRED IN THE OGDEN BRANCH.

That's not gonna fly!

Y’all ready for the stinkers?

You thought we had some pretty bad bosses up to this point, but we haven't even hit

the depths of bad bossery.

We're about to hit the Blighttown of HR.

Vendrick.

Dude, you gotta wear more than a loincloth to work.

Chaos Witch Quelaag and Scorpioness Najka are nude from the waist up...

and nude from the waist down.

Y'all, we have leftover shirts from the softball game, can you just go into the bathroom and

put one of those on, please?

Old Iron King is constantly working from home and he signs all of his emails,

"Sent from my hot tub."

GET OUT OF THE HOT TUB!

Ceaseless Discharge.

The name alone tells me you should have taken a sick day.

Oceiros, the Consumed King is always going on about his son Ocelotte,

showing you pictures of him and his rowing team.

You KNOW that this psych major is gonna replace you as soon as he graduates Yale.

Asylum Demon, Stray Demon, Demon Firesage all have a move called butt slam.

*camera nods in agreement*

Looking Glass Knight.

Reflects everyone's flaws back on them, doesn't look inward enough.

Curse-rotted Greatwood.

Another dress code violation.

Gwyn, Lord of Cinder is kept around because he was the founder and made a lot of money

on Wall Street in the '80s, but he’s hollow inside.

The Covetous Demon is always taking credit for the work that you're doing.

And he steals your lunch from the fridge every day, even though I label it, DAVE.

Abyss Watchers.

Infighting is a very dangerous thing for a group of managers.

The Crystal Sage does a little bit of work, and then vanishes, and then does a little bit more work,

and then vanishes, and then you see them on their instagram story at some beer garden.

Sister Friede is actually a very good boss, and should be up here, but unfortunately

she's the assistant to Father Ariandel

who is SO incompetent he can't untie a chair from his ass.

And finally, the worst boss...

The Gaping Dragon.

Under no circumstances should you be in a work setting

and described as gaping.

All that's left is the top right of this scale, the good bosses, but before we get there,

there are a few bosses that don't really fit into the standard "boss/employee" structure,

or they're basically corporations in their own right, so we'll talk about them as alternatives.

The Bell and the Belfry Gargoyles only come in when someone else is hurting.

So they're kind of like consultants.

Halflight, Spear of the Church could actually be a real-life human player.

And pitting employees against each other is a big no-no.

The Royal Rat Vanguard is one boss rat that's surrounded by a horde of indistinguishable other rats,

so it's just an episode of Undercover Boss.

Afflicted Graverobber, Ancient Soldier Varg, and Cerah the Old Explorer are a trio that...

like, they're just high school friends that decided to get together and open a burger joint,

and they're kind of incompetent but you love them anyway.

The Prowling Magus and Congregation is a startup because it's one charismatic weirdo who takes

credit for all of the hardworking people around them.

We've got some unions!

A good union would be the Skeleton Lords.

It's three lords and a bunch of minions who are recognized and working together toward

the same goal.

That's a good thing.

A worse union is the Deacons of the Deep, where the management only comes in

after five of their employees are killed.

Finally, we have the Executioner's Chariot, whose employees are trying to unionize,

but they keep getting trampled.

And that leaves us with the good ones.

There are only 13 of them.

The Flexile Sentry.

Great multitasker.

The Taurus Demon gives you the tools you need to succeed, and encourages you to climb that ladder,

so that way you can jump down and hit him on the head.

Gravelord Nito has a lot of skeleton friends.

A very good delegator.

The Duke's Dear Freja.

Yeah, she's a big spider...

but she's the Duke's DEAR Freja!

The Duke loves her!

When has the Duke led you astray before?

Come on, man!

The Duke loves her!

Give her a chance!

Pat (offscreen): Do it for the Duke!

Do it for the Duke!

Sinh, the Slumbering Dragon and the Last Giant are slow, deliberate, and they keep on going

even though they got a big fucking spear through 'em.

Elana, the Squalid Queen summons friends when things get a bit too much for her.

That’s good delegation and understanding your limits.

The Ancient Dragon doesn't actually fight you until you fight them, you can just have

a chat with this boss, and honestly, that's good enough sometimes.

Great Grey Wolf Sif is a big wolf with a sword.

FUCK YEAH!

The Nameless King and the King of the Storm.

Now, when the King of the Storm takes enough damage,

the Nameless King will put them out of their misery.

And it's very sad, but it's also what needed to be happen.

That's good management.

I fully expect my boss, Tara Long, to put me out of my misery when I stop being useful.

The Soul of Cinder.

If you kill him, you might become him.

And that's a very clear path to promotion.

It’s not a great path to promotion, but it is a clear one.

The Throne Watcher and Defender are another power couple, but they filled out the HR paperwork.

And they work great together!

They're super professional about it.

They constantly revive the other one when they die, and that's a good boss.

Also, relationship goals.

And finally, the best business boss in Dark Souls...

is The Rotten.

Because this company is employee owned.

Every movement is made by the collective.

Everyone gets a say.

Now you might think you are small, and insignificant,

and also dead.

But!

When you smash together everyone’s stinky, rotting corpse, you can move mountains together.

The best boss is you.

And all of your dead friends.

And in the Dark Souls Corporation, that means you need a job description.

So go ahead and use this handy chart to figure out your Dark Souls boss title.

And that concludes our onboarding seminar.

Make sure to print out your completion certificate at the end of this video

so you can send it to your manager.

Happy managing, and praise the sun!

Under no circumstances should you be in a work setting and described as gaping.

Pat (offscreen): Hey, yo, can I gape in here?

Brian (offscreen, laughing): You guys mind if I gape?

And that concludes our onboarding seminar.

Make sure to celebroderadfjoisfjid.

 2020-06-25 16:19:14,454 - DEBUG - file running:  E3.

The Electronic Entertainment Expo.

What began as a humble video game industry trade show has blossomed into something more

spectacular.

More flamboyant.

More… of whatever this is.

E3 is a chance to show off new games and the theatrical chops of your executives.

Because that’s what E3 really is now.

It’s theater.

It’s like Cats the musical but with more guns and a better plot line.

But this E3 is different.

A lot of companies are ditching the press conference altogether, and those companies

are cowards.

Sony isn’t even showing up to E3 this year!

And it’s not because they lack things to say.

It’s because they have forgotten how to say it.

The industry has lost its way.

That’s why I’ll be giving them the 10 keys to creating a perfect E3 presentation,

and then I’ll be giving you the perfect E3 presentation.

It’s theatre, baby!

The first step is throwing away everything you know about public speaking, because E3

presentations are a beast of their own.

You have to watch them to learn from them.

You might ask, "Brian, wouldn’t learning from old E3s keep you in the rut of old thinking,

making the same mistakes that past business geniuses have made?"

No.

And that brings us to the board.

I have watched hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours of E3

presentations and I have analyzed what makes them compelling.

I’ve distilled the essence of E3 down into 10 simple keys.

If you include these 10 keys, you will create the perfect E3 presentation.

And if you, like most people, aren’t putting on an E3 press conference, then you could

potentially use these 10 keys for like a drinking game or something, I’m not saying you should

do that, I’m saying it’s y… it’s possible.

You could do that if you wanted t… it’s not…

I did that, okay?

You can use these for the drinking game.

The first key: A weirdly high-budget opener.

It is essential to start the presentation with high energy, and it’s essential to

do it in such a way as to make the audience say,

“Hmm yeah wow they really paid for that, huh?”

Sony used to be great at this, starting 2016’s E3 with an entire orchestra playing the God

of War theme, and then last year they started E3 with an entire banjo player.

Weird thing to spend money on.

But both of these intros still get BONUS POINTS, because they started with a live musical number.

The second key is for the presenter.

They have the unenviable task of connecting with a notoriously difficult audience.

How can they reach the fickle gamer while still maintaining business poise?

Business Gamer Fashion.

Business Gamer Fashion is an outfit that is professional, and yet still conveys the idea

that this person could be seen sitting on a couch for 14 hours at a time.

It says, “I’m one of you…

but I’m also way richer than you.”

But the BONUS POINTS go to the one true business gamer fashion:

ill-fitting blazer,

diesel jeans,

gamer t-shirt.

The third key is set dressing.

This has to be theatrical, which is to say, inappropriate for a trade show.

Take a look at Sony’s weird barn church.

It was like an immersive theatrical experience, but with the 10-minute scene transitions of

a high school production of Les Mis.

But the BONUS POINTS go to live, human set pieces, like, I don't know, hanging bodies

from the ceiling that FLAIL AROUND when a character moves through them on the screen.

There’s that classic Sony magic!

I want to remind people that E3 is a trade show.

And this is kind of like if Disney held a press conference about the Avengers and then

DISINTEGRATED A MAN LIVE ON STAGE.

Now we’re moving into the meat and potatoes of the presentation with key number four:

Numbers.

Video Games are just programs and programs are just numbers and for some reason, gamers

love it when numbers are big.

A few good numbers to say are polygon count, amount of enemies on screen, RAM?

Maybe?

I don't know, who gives a shit!?

Honestly, BONUS POINTS go to saying a number that's completely devoid of context.

Because numbers mean…

INNOVATION.

Key number 5.

More specifically... less specifically.

I need this to be the vaguest discussion ever.

I need you to make claims about how you’re doing something that’s never been done before

and then not tell us what you're doing.

Here’s a list of innovative words and phrases.

It’s the presenter’s job to say each and every one of these.

But the BONUS POINTS go to the purest form of expressing innovation.

Looking up at the screen behind you, looking back at the audience, and saying…

“Wow.”

Key number six is the game trailer montage.

You’ve probably never heard of these games before.

You might never hear of them again, but the BONUS POINTS go to the game trailer montage

that comes at the end of the presentation, which is just showing you everything you've

seen so far set to an Arcade Fire soundalike.

These six keys are the foundation of a solid E3 presentation.

You hit these six, you’re in the clear.

But you haven’t achieved perfection yet.

But before we get into the final four, let’s talk about the notable absences.

These are anti-keys, things you’ll never see in an E3 presentation.

I got a list of them here…

Oh what’s this, it’s just a single entry that says “A legitimate discussion about

how to address the crunch crisis that's prevalent in nearly every game studio.”

Well I guess we don't need these anymore!

*wild laughter*

*frightening laughter*

*pained laughter*

*pain*

And now, it's time for the final four keys.

These are the Truly Special Moments.

They’re hard to build in, but they turn a good presentation into a transcendent one.

Key number seven: A “WHYW” game.

This is an acronym that stands for “What? Hell yeah! What!?”

and it's used for a game that makes you go,

“What?

Hell Yeah!

WHAT!?”

Often these are for games that are totally independent, but the best ones are for weird

entries into beloved franchise, like the Final Fantasy XV VR Fishing Game.

Even now, when someone tells me there’s a Final Fantasy XV VR Fishing Game, I go What? HELL YEAH! WHAT!?

But the BONUS POINTS... you know what, actually, no.

You only get bonus points if you make a VR fishing game for a beloved franchise.

I want to watch the Doomslayer catch a bass.

But sometimes, the presenter has a WHYW moment.

That’s why key eight is heartfelt emotion.

Genuine excitement about a game, joy, sadness.

This has to happen naturally.

Honestly, if I’m having a rough day, I will go back and watch the video of Ubisoft developer

Davide Soliani crying after Shigeru Miyamoto compliments him onstage, because that is the

realest and most joyful moment.

Honestly, who wouldn’t burst out crying if Shigeru Miyamoto, the architect of many

of our childhoods, complimented them?

You know, that, that tiny thing... that reminder that these people behind the games are human

beings and can be emotionally moved by the same experience that they get to share with you.

What could be better than that?

If they farted.

That's why key number nine is gaffes!

Gaffes are INTEGRAL to E3, so much so that they're split into three different categories.

The first is technical.

Gameplay going awry.

Cameras cutting back too early.

Mics not getting shut off.

The second category is human.

Awkward pauses, stiff actors, weird phrasing.

These stick in your brain forever.

Honestly, it feels like they’re planned in order to be meme-able and rememberoareble.

Mem- and memorable.

Memorable.

God, I can’t speak today…

OR CAN I?

THE THIRD CATEGORY IS PLANNED GAFFES.

I’m about to blow this whole thing wide open.

Everyone can quote at least one E3 gaffe.

Even people who don’t know who Reggie Fils Aime is have probably said “my body is ready”

at least once in their life.

And you want to know what that is?

GUERRILLA MARKETING.

The only reason there are so many gaffes in E3 presentations is to MAKE YOU SHARE THE GAFFES.

YOU MIGHT NOT REMEMBER THE GOOD PRESENTATIONS, BUT YOU SURE AS HELL LAUGHED AT THE MESSY ONES.

THE GAFFES ARE AN INSIDE JOB TO MAKE YOU BUY MORE VIDEO GAMES.

So honestly, I’m just gonna assume that all of these are planned from here on out

in order to make you talk about them online.

Except for when Todd Howard says something that's weirdly horny.

Todd: "You'll never know when you'll need a free hand."

That’s just Todd.

BONUS POINTS for horny Todd.

And the final key: The Big Finish.

This is a game announcement that falls purely into the fanservice bucket.

It is unimaginably amazing, incomprehensibly great, unbelievably too good to be true and

honestly, it's because it probably is too good to be true.

The presenter is gonna say “And one more thing,” and then they're gonna show a trailer

that’s probably a landscape shot, maybe some voiceover, and then just a title screen.

BONUS POINTS if it literally is just a title screen.

And then that game is probably gonna get stuck in development hell for 7 years and maybe

not get released ever.

But isn’t that what we want, as gamers?

To be disappointed?

And those are the 10 keys to a perfect E3 presentation.

Follow these and you can do no wrong.

And if you aren’t doing an E3 presentation, again, you could potentially use them as a

drinking game.

It's not like I wrote up all the rules already and you can click and you can play 'em along

with us since we're gonna watch all the E3 presentations.

And to prove the power of these keys, here’s my perfect E3 presentation.

Sony, go ahead and just plug your trailers into the placeholders I set up for you.

What does a gamer want?

(what does a gamer want, tell me what does a gamer want)

What does a gamer need?

(what does a gamer need, tell me what does a gamer need)

The games we make are powerful,

never been done before.

So let your inner gamer out, we’ll open up the door!

I know you’ll love these games, because I love these games, too.

And it feels the best when there’s an excited gamer inside you.

Hunter, Hunter, let me get off of the skate...

Jesus.

Hunter, get it!

Good afternoon, and welcome to Unraveled Games’ E3 press conference.

As a gamer myself, you can tell by the shirt, I’m so excited to share these fresh gaming

innovations with you all today.

But before we get to the fun part, let's talk some business.

Let me put on my blazer.

Let’s talk about how we’re changing the game… of games.

The new Unraveled Engine has allowed us to create experiences that are more detailed

than ever before.

I'm talking about 1,200 enemies onscreen concurrently, over 49 meganpixels of screen dissolution,

62 giganbotes of RAM,

and SEVEN HUNDRED and TWENTY THOUSAND…

I know it sounds like science fiction, but it’s science fact.

Why don’t we highlight a few of the games that are coming out on the Unraveled Engine.

We can go to the next slide.

Jen?

Jen, we can go to the next.

Next Gen!

First up, Unraveled Research 2.

Fans loved the experience of creating spreadsheets about video game lore, but in this immersive

sequel, you can do that with a mustache.

Wow.

And that’s not all.

We have Explaining Your Job to your Relatives Simulator, the Dark Souls of simulation games.

Experience the terror firsthand of trying to explain to your uncle that you work in

a very niche, unstable industry, but with graphics so lifelike you’ll feel like you’re

living in the world of the game.

No, Uncle Bob, I don’t make the video games, I just make videos about them.

No, they aren’t the trailers.

Terrifying.

And finally, something groundbreaking, something that seems impossible, but we did it.

I hope you come along with us on this journey of...

BDG Goes Fishing for the First Time

in VR.

*What?

Hell yeah!

What!?*

*Audience cheering*

I've got the rest of the press conference to get through, you

can quiet down, please.

But is that all we’ve got for you?

Not in the slightest.

Now it's time to show you some stuff from the company that didn't do the presentation,

and let us do all the hard work for them.

Hit it.

*Arcade Fire soundalike plays*

Wow.

You know, I, um, I'm gonna go off script a little bit.

I, uh, it just, I've...

It means so much to me to be up here on this stage in front of you.

It's been a dream since I was a kid to be presenting something at E3, and to have you

here in the audience... to, to feel the support that you've given Unraveled Games, is...

Honestly, it's, um...

I never in a million years thought that I could have-

OH JESUS, HUNTER, DON'T TRY TO...

God damnit.

Okay that’s it, uh, thank you all for coming.

Except we've got one more thing thing for you.

We’ve been working on something very special with some very special people.

From the visionary minds of David Cage and Peter Molyneux, we have teamed up with publisher

Konami to release an exclusive on Soulja Boy’s gaming console… you know what, I won’t

bore you with the business details, I’ll just let you see the trailer.

Voice over: Yeah.

I think it’s time.

*intense music plays*

*applause*

Thank you all so much for coming!

Thank you.

Have a great E3!

Hunter, get it!

*CRASH* Ha, we're good.

That's the take though.

*everyone laughing* Almost, almost broke a laptop.

But that's fine.

We're good.

Fallout.

This scrappy, billion-dollar franchise takes a fun, kooky

look at planet-wide armageddon.

It's an alternate history, splitting off from our timeline somewhere

around World War II.

Despite the divergence, Fallout features some familiar real world

culture and plenty of cultural innovation. There are new architectural styles that are

stolen from Mad Max. And plenty of cool new fashion

that is also just ripped off from Mad Max.

And yet, even with this cultural innovation, Fallout has one massive problem.

And there's only one problem with the Fallout series right now.

Other than that, the Fallout series is doing just fine.

D-despite this one. It's just the one of them.

Why, Todd,

is the music still this?

*audio from three Fallout songs played simultaneously*

The same dozen songs from before the apocalypse.

You're telling me that humans figured out how to

make a gun that turns you into goo, and yet they haven't made any new music?

That’s garbage, Todd.

Fallout is a meditation on mutation and the ways that humanity and culture

evolve to meet new challenges,

and having music that stays the same the whole time is a plot hole.

War never changes. But music should.

And today, I’m going to change it.

*tech montage music playing*

Ooh! This is a new dance move for me.

I don't know if I like it yet.

Now, you may think that Fallout’s music is fine. It fits the aesthetic, and

it adds a sense of retrofuturism.

But you’re wrong, and here’s why.

The Fallout games range in time from 2102, the year of Fallout 76, to 2287, the year of Fallout 4.

That’s a span of 185 years. Imagine for a second that our musical sensibilities hadn’t been

updated in nearly two hundred years, and the current song topping the Billboard charts

was The Alphabet Song, a song literally written about 185 years ago.

Actually, that kind of sounds possible. Modern times are weird.

What I’m saying is that if 80% of humans died today, in 100 years,

we'd still have Old Town Road, but it would have a few more remixes.

Do you really think that if the world ended in 1997, our culture would linger over

"Barbie Girl" and "Tubthumping"? That we would be complacent with the cultural detritus of euro-techno,

manufactured pop, and third-wave ska?

NO!

And yet it seems the people of Fallout have

forgotten how to make music.

Fallout 76 is littered with instruments and bandstands and stages,

but by the time you get to Fallout 3, the only instrument left is a Stradivarius

violin locked in a vault surrounded by mirelurks.

Fallout 76 also has the highest track count,

nearly twice as many as all of the other games, which implies that these tracks are being

lost over time, and nothing is there to replace it.

Only two people in the entire 185-year-span

of these games are making new songs. The first is a synth that makes the same bluesy style

as the rest of the music.

It’s good but it’s not different.

The other is a burnout DJ who does not seem to know how to sing or play an instrument.

And yet he still insists on playing a guitar,

which goes to prove that even in the apocalypse, you can’t escape

the guy who will bring his guitar to your party.

Thank god the bombs went off before "Wonderwall."

People need food to eat, sure, and, you know, clothes to cover their sinful

bods so that makes sense that those areas have continued to flourish. But Fallout is

a world where people have ignored the basic human endeavor of making art.

I won’t stand for that!

We need art because of its fundamental importance to human expression.

Songs were made long before written language to help keep stories alive, and they'd be added to

and embellished, much like the cultural touchstone of our time,

TVTropes.org.

Science may improve our health and longevity, but art is what makes long life worth living.

And that’s why I am here — to scientifically improve on this art,

and synthesize a totally new genre of music that we should be hearing in the Fallout universe.

This genre should be inspired by the music landscape and culture of Fallout's world.

Any cultural step that goes One Step Beyond current accepted standards

risks alienating its audience by being too challenging,

too intelligent.

So let’s guide our creation by considering the 10 definitive purposes of music

and how they fit into the beautiful wasteland of Todd’s mindscape.

First, to create or control emotion.

From the soaring, triumphant music of Jurassic Park

to the ice cream truck version of "Pop Goes the Weasel,"

which, for reasons I don’t understand, always makes me cry.

Evoking emotion is the number one use for music.

So what does that mean for Fallout? Well, one thing the soundtrack does get right is the upbeat tempo

of most of the songs. It cheers up the experience of playing through the wasteland.

Except for the miserable, inescapable energy of "Johnny Guitar."

Play it again, my Johnny.

In the wasteland, you need something to rev you up, keep you moving. And that's why this new genre

will only feature peppy songs.

Two: remembering or sharing information.

These can be simple mnemonics like Schoolhouse Rock! Or classic story ballads

like Kesha’s "TiK ToK."

I actually believe these will be more important than emotions just because

written language seems to be pretty dead in the future. It’s all on abandoned computers

or in diaries safely tucked up in a skeleton's ribcage.

Up-to-date information is transmitted verbally, and think about how much further it could go if it was sung.

Even an S.O.S. signal gets more traction if it comes with a little ditty,

and I learned that from Rihanna.

Three: Entertainment.

*cheesy music plays*

Four: Jingles. In other words,

propaganda.

Commercial jingles are designed to make you remember brands, and political songs fit here, too.

Because what is the "Star Spangled Banner" if not America’s jingle?

Despite the amount of remnant advertising for companies like Nuka-Cola and Radiation King,

the only jingles that remain in Fallout are the ones on Gene Autry’s spurs.

*(I Got Spurs That) Jingle, Jangle, Jingle plays ominously*

In the song he says his spurs jingl-

Fallout does have a few antiquated political songs on Enclave Radio, but as Plato said:

“Any musical innovation is full of danger to the whole State...

when modes of music change, the State always changes with them.”

Thank you, Plato.

The transitive property means that the opposite must be true as well.

Fallout’s state has very much changed, and so too should the music.

So our music genre should be catchy to the point of propaganda.

You hear this song once, and you know the hook and exactly what it wants you to do.

Five: To mark time rhythmically in a group, like a chain gang or rowing.

An underlying theme of Fallout is a disruption of low-wage labor systems.

Half the locations are robot warehouses or Nuka-Cola factories

or the industrial goo pit where The Joker was made.

In the 2100s, commerce is no longer the main structure around

which a human’s life is organized.

So fuck the Man, and fuck the beat he made you drum to.

The Man was beating you down, so we’re gonna focus on the up-beats.

The off-beats. Something more syncopated.

This isn't to say we're going to get overly complicated with 7/4s and 15/8 time signatures.

Those time signatures only belong in math rock,

which is to say in the garbage.

We’re taking back 4/4 from the Man and we're making it our own.

Six: Tradition music, to mark events or occasions.

This can range from singing "Auld Lang Syne" on New Years

to playing "Pop Goes the Weasel" whenever one of your pet weasels died when you were a kid.

THAT'S WHY.

They’re just songs that usher in a specific moment, like an alarm.

But most cultures in Fallout don’t seem to use them.

At the end of the quest “A Nice Day for a Right Wedding,” there is a wedding but no wedding march.

And in the quest “For Auld Lang Syne,” they do not play "Auld Lang Syne."

Which means there’s a real opening to be the only tradition song for every holiday in Fallout.

It may seem lame to force a tradition song, like making all of your friends call you by a nickname you gave yourself,

but if you believe that every tradition song came about naturally, you’re naive.

You think Vitamin C didn’t know that the graduation song would become a once-a-year cash cow?

That when Green Day was writing “Good Riddance” they weren’t

thinking “Some sitcoms are gonna have to end someday.”

Tradition songs can be crafted,

and our first song in this new genre will fit this bill.

Seven: Ambient music or background music.

A.K.A. Chill anime beats to study and relax to.

Nobody in Fallout is studying or relaxing. This one is a guide on what not to do in our new genre.

Our genre should be present and aggressive, and when you’re listening to it, you are listening to it.

Eight: To create or maintain social groups.

Without labor to constrict a person’s time or movement,

people organize into social, cult-like gangs, which makes this category

a big one. You’ve got LARPers, the AV club, the rude boys, all of which have their own

cultural standards. But there is a distinct lack of punks, which came about through a

shared political consciousness expressed through music. But we can be that, we just need to

include identity-establishing lyrics that appeal to all denizens of the Wasteland.

Perhaps this genre will help unify all of the many warring factions.

Or at least create a new, very cool warring faction.

Number nine: Stimulating physical movement. Dancing.

There is no dancing in Fallout! Well, there are a few sex workers in Fallout New Vegas that dance, but it kind

of just looks like the dancing baby gif, so I don’t think that should count.

And Fallout 76 hasn’t included a singular dancing emote. All they have are things like “smoking kills”

and “join my polycule?”

This is probably to avoid overlapping with Fortnite, which

does have a pretty long head start on dancing emotes. So for the sake of originality, I

had my research assistant, Google, find all of the dances that haven't been included in Fortnite yet.

It's just a Regency-era quadrille, and skanking.

We will make it work.

And the tenth purpose of music is to use it as a crutch when you can’t think of a different way

to end a video.

Actually, I don't think this one really applies to the Fallout universe,

so I'm just gonna take it off.

So with our nine definitive purposes of music, we can

begin to build our genre. And the more I’m thinking about these nine purposes, the more

I'm realizing that Fallout has the opportunity to create the perfect genre. One not tied

down to the whims of society.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

The current music in Fallout is overwhelmingly jazz standards and rhythm and blues,

so we'll incorporate elements from those genres.

We’ll have heavy beats, syncopation, rhythm guitar, and honestly, any instrument

that fits in a mobile wasteland setting. So no pianos, but any marching instrument, like

trumpets and trombones. Things that stand up to roughing it and also would appeal to

the Brotherhood of Steel. Another thing these jazz standards excel at is having a powerful,

catchy melody sung by a main vocalist, but since it’s hard to maintain your safety

as a loner in the wasteland, we can have a lot of backing vocalists, too.

If you can carry a gun, you can carry a tune.

In terms of topics for the songs, we'll keep the themes

relevant to the people of Fallout, which based on my experience seems to be freedom from

tyranny, looting, and drinking so I can be stronger and carry more loot.

Now, we mix together these in-fiction elements with our nine definitive purposes of music.

One: We’re gonna make people happy. Needs to be Jeep commercial music. Yeah, your wife just got

eaten by a yao guai, but listen to that skiffle.

Two: All of our heroes are dead. So it's time

to make new heroes. How else are we gonna know how many beers Janice drank last week,

or how far Kevin’s head went flying when a super mutant tagged him with a fire hydrant.

Three:

Bangers only.

Four: What should I do with the information about how many beers

Janice drank? Tell me.

This is music for the scavenger, not the assembly line worker. There’s

a whole world of useful scrap out there, and this music should inspire you to get out there

and pick it up!

Six: The old ways are dead! And we've gotta make new songs to celebrate

the new ways. There is no song for when your Swamp Itch clears up.

But there should be.

Seven: Background music? NO. This is FOREGROUND MUSIC.

Eight: Fallout is a world divided,

awaiting a messiah of music to bring them all together

or at least inspire them to wear cooler clothes.

Nine: The music should inspire dances that are violent and rushed, just like

the world you're in. Yeah, your fists are used for melee, but that leaves your feet

and your elbows open to fuckin' jam!

You starting to imagine it? You starting to hear those first few notes in your head? THAT’S GOOD!

What are we gonna call this new genre that

is peppy! Informational! Good! Catchy! Pick up loot!

Traditional! In your face! Punk!

Kicks! Energetic! Educational! Fun! Sticks in your head! Pick it up!

For your cousin Ben's wedding! Right there! Society.

*dancing noises*

Spicy! Slaps hard! Pick it up! Propaganda.

Arbor Day! Pick it up!

Fuck you, Philip Glass!

Pick it up! Let's all wear the same shoes!

*repeating "DANCE!" and "PICK IT UP" over and over*

Pick it up!

*heavy breathing*

Did I just make Ska again?

*Ska music starts*

You spend your life living in a vault, and your mind begins to crack.

And when you get outside, there’s nothing to welcome you back.

She found me passed out in a rundown shack with Nuka Buzz in my hand.

She picked me up and she slapped my face, and said "Come on let’s start a band!"

She said: START THE MUSIC, Pick up loot, get off your ass!

If you don’t feel the Brotherhood of Steel, join the Brotherhood of Brass.

She said: START THE NEW, War never changes, that’s a bore!

You know we’ll eclipse the apocalypse

with a loud and brassy SKALLOUT WAR.

SKALLOUT WAR!

SKALLOUT WAR!

SKALLOUT WAAAAAAAAR!

SKALLOUT WAR!

I've never skanked so hard in my life. 
 2020-06-25 16:19:14,455 - DEBUG - file running:  Fire Emblem!

This magnificent franchise pushes the boundaries of gaming by daring to ask the question,

"What if chess made you horny?"

Fire Emblem is turning 30 next year, and with 16 main games and few spinoffs,

it's safe to say that it has grown into something extraordinary.

The games are packed with deep storylines and memorable characters, like Marth.

That's not Marth? Marth.

That's- which one is Marth?

Marth.

The problem with having such a prolific series is that the characters start to blend together.

One needs only to look at the Super Smash Bros. roster to see that

Fire Emblem characters are a bit hard to differentiate.

It's like trying to remember your coworkers' names after meeting them once at a work mixer.

Except in this case, your coworkers all have swords and can only make one facial expression.

But do not worry. There is an answer to this conundrum. Because today,

I'm going to teach you how to tell apart every Fire Emblem character.

*cheery synth music*

My face is just not built for this expression.

First step in this process is to collect a list of the characters.

Turns out, even after trimming the nonplayable ones and the ones from the Tokyo Mirage Sessions,

there are nearly 600 Fire Emblem characters.

I cannot explain that many characters.

I have made that mistake before.

"Trying to categorize all 600 Castlevania monsters was a bad idea."

But the beauty of making mistakes is that you can learn from them. And I now know understand

that explaining 600 discrete characters wouldn't actually be helpful.

Human beings aren't meant to remember 600 people perfectly. If you don't believe me,

just try to remember something about every single person in your contact list.

I have a contact for someone name Zain.

And in the company, it just says "Bocce Ball."

Who the fuck is this?

But unlike my contact list, Fire Emblem's have plotlines.

And in my experience playing these games, I noticed

that a lot of these different characters fit similar roles in their respective games.

And I'm not the only one who's noticed this. On the Fire Emblem wiki, there is a whole list

of archetypes based on different characters.

A list that I only found after spending whole day trying to categorize them on my own.

And it's just so fun to realize that you've wasted a whole day of work.

But this list intrigued me.

Stock characters in similar circumstances playing again and again in different stories.

Does that remind you of anything?

Of course it does!

It reminds you of the commedia dell'arte,

because it reminds me of the commedia dell'arte.

And it's so obviously the commedia dell'arte that I don't need to explain it.

But I will for the sake of extending this video.

The commedia dell'arte was an Italian form of theater that was big in the 16th to 18th centuries,

and it relied on stock characters wearing masks or costumes to designate who they were.

That way the audience could be like,

"Ah, that dude's wearing a tight fitting suit with a bunch of weird patches, that must

be Arlecchino, the servant clown — sometimes to two masters!"

This brought the audience in immediately. They knew what that character was about without any exposition.

In the same way, Fire Emblem has dozens of recurring characters that get you through each game.

And this is how we're going to tell them apart. By defining their archetypes.

Fire Emblem goes one step further.

Because these characters can not only serve the same story purpose,

but they can have a similar role in the gameplay.

And this goes to prove my theory

that Fire Emblem is not only the spiritual successor to commedia dell'arte,

it is its natural evolution.

An elevated form I call...

THE COMMEDIA DELL'ANIME.

The newer, more perfect form of theater.

We just have to boil down the Fire Emblem personnel into

*kiss*

syrupy stock characters.

Let's begin with the archetypes that are standard.

Cain and Abel are battle bros. They fight together, but not in the biblical sense.

Bord and Cords are similar except they're usually axe fighters.

Pegasus sisters are a trio of flying horses ladies.

You can't split these archetypes up into their solo characters because their bond is what defines them.

You can't have a Waluigi without a Luigi.

And in the same way, you can't have a Bord without a Cord.

Which is my favorite Dr. Seuss book.

Jagens are mentors that are strong in the beginning and then you'll quickly outpace them, and it's kind of sad.

Like the first time you beat your dad in a basketball game.

Oifeys are similar to Jagens,

except they'll keep dunking on you till you're dead.

Wendells but for magic.

Gotohs are mentors but only the last half of the game.

Beowolfs are mercenaries that you have to pay actual in-game currency

to recruit, and Ogmas are mercenaries that usually decide to join you out of their own volition.

Which is, by definition, not a mercenary.

Navarres are silent, moody sword swingers.

Kind of like if that person who said they studied the blade actually studied the blade.

There are also a bunch of villains but for different reasons. Power. Ambition. Loyalty.

Wyvern riding, I guess.

And getting possessed, which is a classic mistake.

Some archetypes are based on their gameplay requirements.

Very difficult to recruit.

Usually recruited after they've been kidnapped.

Late game recruits that could be good, but you have to work hard.

Super low level villagers that could also be good.

And if you recruit one of these pairs,

you can't get the other.

Kind of like if two of your friends start dating and then have a really messy breakup.

Corneliuses are usually the parental figure to the main character,

and they have this nasty habit of getting axed super early on in the game.

It's kind of like Fire Emblem doesn't know how to make interesting characters without making them

suffer traumatic parental death.

Tacticians. Young female mages. Young female healers.

Young male mages.

Thieves.

Jeorges do that thing where they pretend to be not important

and then SURPRISE, I wasn't an old crone, I was a magical witch the whole time!

Except they're not very good at hiding the fact that they're important.

And the creepy version of the Jeorges:

The Tikis.

Usually they take the form of a small girl or adolescent, except

they're really 400 years old and a god or a dragon.

And I honestly do not have the time to unpack this bullshit.

These 29 archetypes are useful, but they only cover 229 characters.

There are still 367 to go. If we keep this up, we're going to end up with 75 archetypes.

The commedia dell'arte only has about 17.

So before we move on, let's combine some.

These six are all mentors to varying degrees of usefulness.

These are all defined by their villainy and only some of them become playable.

Welcome to Cain Siblings Incorporated, where we all have a sibling like bond and do the same job.

These all have very specific requirements for recruiting.

These both do that thing where they don't seem important and then Surprise!

I'm important!

These are all hard to make good but they're worth it if you put the effort in.

These are all precocious little magic babies.

And that leaves the Navarres unconnected,

but that's because I'm changing the archetype to Spicy Swords. Because we can include so

many other characters if we just expand the definitions to any swordweilder

who's a little spicy.

In fact, by combining these other archetypes, there are now tons of other characters who

fit into these expanded definitions.

We are left with 288 characters to categorize. But before I get there,

I just want to commend Fire Emblem for have 596 playable characters

and only repeating three names.

When I was hired for my first job at a climbing gym,

I was one of five employees named Brian, and it was a small gym.

But I guess it's pretty easy to cut out repetitions when you use dope-ass names like Skrimir.

Dagdar.

Sleuf.

Fjorm.

Belf.

I could go on all day.

But I won't. Because it's time to get the rest of the archetypes on the wall.

*charging noise*

That took like 30 minutes. But let's begin.

The honorable knight, like Fiona, who cares passionately about her people,

and will always oppose cruelty to civilians.

Which is way better than the loyal knight, like Troude, who only is loyal

to Perne, and will do literally anything for him even though Perne is a bad dude.

But I'll get to that later.

These four archetypes are calm and aloof, and the only thing that differentiates them

is how much you would want to invite them to your birthday party.

I'm just gonna get the blank slate archetype out of the way now,

because Fire Emblem is a game with permadeath,

and so sometimes you just need more meat for the grinder, you know?

Similar to the blank slate is the protagonist,

which is always relatively heroic, but since they're a conduit for the player, they're all pretty vague.

I realize that by smooshing them all together into one category,

I've made the majority of the Fire Emblem roster in Super Smash indistinguishable.

But that's not my fault!

Super Smash should've included more magic babies!

Arrogants, hotheads, and edgelords all have a mean side,

but arrogants like Vaike just think they're the best.

Hotheads like Caspar want to fight anything that moves.

And edgelords like Niles retweet Joker accounts unironically.

A lot of these characters have rough childhoods but then turn out cheerful despite that.

And then there's the inferiority complex archetype, which I could have just called

"The majority of children in Fire Emblem: Fates."

Perfectionists, mischief makers, and flirts are all highly motivated.

But Subaki is motivated to meet high expectations.

Claude is motivated to make intricate schemes.

And Sylvain is motivated to be a fuccboi.

Buzzkills are just characters that aren't very fun to talk to.

And Fire Emblem, I will never forgive you for naming an unemotional, uber religious, deadbeat dad Gilbert.

It also doesn't help that I look like Hanneman Lite.

Oh god, am I a buzzkill?

A lot of these archetypes are based around one singular personality trait.

Scarlet's straightforward. Valbar's chill.

Linhardt's lazy. Sumia's clumsy. Petra's a sweetie.

And Ranulf is a furry.

Dramatic, painter, and fashionable are defined by their love of the arts

and how much it sucks that they gotta be a soldier instead.

Some archetypes upset the status quo by defying gender norms

or by calling out the noble class, and that's why they're comrades.

Child soldier.

Karin is canonically 14 years old.

Whoopsie!

But even if they aren't a child, they could still be naive.

Which brings around the overprotective archetype,

which is just essentially helicopter parents.

Manuela is constantly drinking and flirting and just being a hot mess and I love her for it.

And that makes her the president of vices.

The vice president.

But be careful not to do that around someone like Astram, who is constantly accusing people of treason

for no good reason.

There's a lot of characters in the meek murderer archetype

because Fire Emblem loves to make characters that are quiet and shy and really self conscious,

and then can WRECK SHOP on the battlefield.

Here's an archetype I call "what the fuck" and it's the three characters that make me say,

"What the fuck, Fire Emblem?"

People like Perne, who is said to be a sweet Robin Hood type,

except he does kidnap a young girl and keeps her as his slave.

Or Tharja, who practices curses on her own daughter.

Or Roger, who is act- he's not actually that bad.

But Fire Emblem does go out of their way to make his endscreen say that he never gets a date

and he stays single for the rest of his life.

And it's like, what the fuck, Fire Emblem? You didn't have to do him dirty like that.

The next archetype is called "actually pretty interesting." These characters are three dimensional

and well-developed. People like Libra, who struggles with his faith and has incredible

self doubt even though he's doing all he can to help those around him. Or Rhys, who dreams

of being a swordfighter, but his weak constitution won't allow him to become one. And so he helps

in the ways he can, but his whole story is one of unfulfilled dreams.

And that's it.

Those are the only two interesting characters in Fire Emblem.

Until we get to Raphael.

My sweet, bulky boy who only cares about eating and training and not about studying.

The thing is, the Fire Emblem world has moved past himbos and bimbos.

Welcome to the age of thembos.

There. 45 archetypes to help you differentiate the 596 Fire Emblem characters.

If you're a GOSH DANG ROCKET SCIENTIST!

45 is still too much! We can combine these.

We'll take these six and combine them to create a new archetype that is as important as it is bland.

These three can be more succinctly summarized in a category called

"Holy shit, why are you a soldier?"

Let's just go ahead and cordon off all of the assholes.

And now we can take these straight-talking suck ups and call them teacher's pets.

Shhhh.

These three archetypes all have tough exteriors to break through.

These three archetypes really explore familial bonds,

which is a RARE CONDITION, IN THIS DAY-

Whether it's a good or bad reaction doesn't matter to this group, they just want to be seen.

They're just too nice for all this!

These four archetypes will always be subverting expectations.

It's fairly surprising that these three archetypes were let in.

Chill dudes? Gambling? A bunch of hunks?

Damn if these aren't fun to hang out with.

All three of these are going to time out, 'cause they need to calm it down.

And there we go.

The 13 archetypes that make it possible to differentiate the Fire Emblem characters.

Just 13 of them.

That's fewer than the commedia dell'arte.

It's only 13.

Which is not only an unlucky number,

but it is TOO LARGE for your TINY CHILD BRAINS.

We can make it better! We can combine more! WE CAN PERFECT THIS!

Granted, it's a little bit harder to combine these archetypes, but just off the bat, we can take

"look at me baby" and "making waves" and just combine it into one thing, trendsetters.

And the "necessary but boring" and the "asshole crew" and the "teacher's pets" and the "calm it downs,"

they all fill me with a sense of UGH.

And obviously the "too nice for this" and the "lied on your resume" and the "holy shit why are you a soldiers"

are all just a bad choice for a war!

And that just leaves us with the characters that are hard to break

the ice with, and uh, the ones that got family issues, and the quiet ones, and the ones that

are fun to hang out with!

Uh.

And that just sounds like a pretty run-of-the-mill

awkward family reunion.

And when you think about it, these ones are just strange characters that

have, uh, that are good at fighting.

I mean if you include Dmitri in this, he has an eye patch!

Okay, which is similar to these ones.

Seteth and Byleth have the, they rhyme.

Uh we also, I mean.

Dorothea wears a hat until she grows out of the hat.

Think about that!

Don't even get me started on Oboro.

I don't know who that is.

Is it pronounced "dice" or "deesay?"

And we can have a category called

"anime character with a singular personality trait and a penchant for violence"

and that's just the one category!

Which PROVES that the Fire Emblem characters are all essentially the same,

and that you cannot differentiate them.

Mission complete!

What was this Unraveled about again?

...Sometimes to two masters!

Patrick: Now Italian.

(Brian in a shitty Italian accent) Ah! That guy is...

oh god I don't know if I can.

Ah that dudes wearing a tight fitting suit with a buncha weird patches it

must be Arlecchino the servant clown sometimesa to two masters!

(Pat and Jenna offscreen laughing)

Brian: Ah I don't know if... Okay.

Pat: We don't have to use it but we need to record it.

By this point, pretty much every gaming publication has announced their Game of the Year...

uhh...

which means that I'm a bit late.

Anything that I say is just a drop in the ocean of discourse.

No one wants to hear my opinion.

WHICH IS WHY I AM NOT EXPRESSING AN OPINION.

I AM STATING A FACT.

That’s right, I have devised a statistical, analytical, number-crunching formula

that will SCIENTIFICALLY PROVE

THE GAME OF THE YEAR.

*hype 80s music plays*

They said it couldn’t be done.

A bias-free formula to calculate the game of the year?

That's a fool’s errand, Brian!

You are a fool!

They called me a fool!

But do I look like a fool to you?

I’ve done it, and with the knowledge I have found, I can go ahead and assuage any arguments

you might have with your friends.

There is nothing to debate anymore, there is only the truth, that the best game of the year is...

hidden somewhere, um, in these spreadsheets.

I'm gonna be honest with you, I haven’t...

there are a lot of numbers.

And I haven't had the time to, uh, do them all just yet.

But it’s only December 14th.

This video is set to go up on the 30th, which means I still have two weeks for new games

to come in before I can really call which game is the game of the year.

But I've at least finished the formula, and I’ve tested it on a few to make sure it

runs correctly.

And everyone knows that you can’t get full credit unless you show your work.

So let me show you how I made it.

First thing you gotta do when you're making a GOTY formula is find your list of games.

And obviously we're going to have to choose every single game that was released this year

in order for us to say that it is scientifically accurate.

So if we just go ahead and take a look at Steam and see how many were released since

January 1st 20-hmm.

That's over 15,000.

You can't make me do that, legally.

That's not in my contract.

Right?

I can't... they can't legally make me do that.

Look, as much as video game reviews can be an imperfect reflection of the person who

is writing them, they are still a pretty solid baseline for which video games mattered in our culture.

Even if a review is bad, it still means it was good enough for someone to spend time on it.

So I went Metacritic and I took all the games that were rated 80 or above, and at

the time of writing this script, that was 181 games.

So I'm gonna do the formula for all of those.

Some of these games were DLCs or re-releases onto new platforms.

The Switch alone resurrected about a dozen candidates from years past.

But since they were released this year, they are still technically in the running.

Fight me.

Now that we have the list, it's time to make the formula, and it might surprise you to

hear this, but I have not been in a pure mathematics class in about five years.

So I reached out to some scientists.

And then none of them got back to me.

So I called my old roommate.

“Hey, I’m Nicholas.

I’m a graduate student studying exoplanet atmospheres.”

Nick is working toward a PhD at MIT, and though I was a bit worried about reaching out to

him since his specialization is in astrophysics and not stats about video games,

he assuaged all my fears.

Brian - "Would you say you are a math expert?”

Nick - “No.”

We chatted for about a half an hour, diving deep into the scientific method and the selfless

goals of discovery.

Brian - “If I invent a unit... can I trademark it.”

Nick - “I think your final score should be, like, in Gilberts or whatever.”

Brian - "OK!"

And we finished our chat with the reassurance that this formula was not only going to help

the gaming community, but the scientific community at large.

Brian - “Do you think if I wrote this up, I could get it published in, like, Nature?"

Nick - “No.”

So where to do we go from here now that we have been scientifically rejuvenated?

It's time to build the criteria.

What specifically makes a game of the year?

Number one, what is the game worth?

We're not just talking about monetary worth, we're also talking about the amount of enjoyment

you get while playing the game.

Number two, how them graphics?

We’re trying to find specific numbers associated with these games, and graphics is just a bunch

of numbers anyway, so this will be a useful part.

Number three, how did it affect the cultural miasma?

Look, it’s all about those google results, how many people are talking about the game?

And most importantly, is the game art?

I've figured it out.

Which means that no one has to write any more goddamn thinkpieces about this topic ever again!

Given these four criteria, I sat down with Tara Long, former bioinformatics researcher

and also my current boss.

She and I figured out a formula that will end up with a numerical value that will tell

us the game of the year.

The higher the number, the better the game.

We’ll start with game worth.

Now it’s hard for us to find how worth it a game is to play from a numerical standpoint,

but if you take Metacritic’s score as a percentage of the game you enjoy, and you

multiply that by the average amount of minutes each playthrough takes using the stats from

howlongtobeat.com, then you end up with a number of minutes you have spent enjoying said game.

Now, to tie in material worth, we want to go ahead and take in the original listed price

of the game and divide it by this number so that way we can end up with a DPM: dollars

per minute enjoyed.

Now, it’s hard to decide if you want a high or a low DPM, because some people want the

most bang for their buck, while others are willing to spend a little bit more for a really

well-enjoyed minute.

But just to standardize this, I'm going to assume lower is better — that means you've

paid less per minute you've enjoyed — and that way I can use it to divide literally

the rest of the equation.

HOW BOUT THEM GRAPHICS?

In the past few years, people have cared less and less about how many

polygons you've got on the screen and more about the style.

But one thing that hasn't changed is frame rate.

People want the most frames per second.

So, factually, the more frames, the better.

That means we're going to go ahead and take the highest frame rate available in the game

and we're gonna multiply that by the seconds of average playthrough, again from howlongtobeat.com.

And that will give us the amount of frames per game.

The game frames mainframe.

But how many frames does a gamer game in the gameframe mainframe?

That's a good question.

Now if you go ahead and you take your frames per game and divide it by the number of gamers,

I’m talking about however many copies have been sold or however many number of downloads

there have been, then that's going to leave you with frames per game per gamer, and that’s

a really important number, because if you have 200,000 frames per game and you have

200,000 gamers, that's 200,000 gamers that have only had one frame per game per gamer.

And that is no good, is it?

Is it?

I actually have... um, I'm a little confused now.

We're gonna take frames per game per gamer and we're gonna put it on the top of this

equation, because we want it to be the biggest number possible.

And now it’s time for cultural relevancy.

We want our games of the year to be big and brash and bold and boisterous, letting people

outside of the gaming world know,

Hey!

This is a thing!

So how do we judge a game’s effect on the world at large?

Well, we go ahead and we take all of the Google results that come up when you search

the game's full name and the word game.

But that’s not everything, right?

That's just the bare minimum.

It's like saying, “This dude’s bad haircut is important just because a lot of people are talking about it,”

which I know isn’t true from personal experience.

So I went on twitter and I asked you lovely folks what descriptors you expect to see in

descriptions of games of the year.

And you gave me a lot.

So I went ahead and I plugged all those into Google’s advanced search along with the

game's name, and I took those results and I multiplied it by the base Google search.

And I got very big numbers.

But don't worry, we're going to bring these numbers down to size, because some of the

descriptions you sent in were actually pretty negative descriptions of games.

So I did a Google search using those descriptions, and then I multiplied those results by one

plus the number of Funko Pops made of characters in the game,

which is objectively a terrible thing.

Now this is going to leave you with BCE, or your base cultural effect, and we're gonna

multiply that by our FPGPG in order to get a pretty big number.

But before we’re done with cultural effect, I want you to ask yourself, is this the culture at large?

Does this go outside of our gaming bubble?

There’s really only one way to tell that, and that's by using the M.O.M. variable,

which stands for: "My Own Mother."

So I called my own mother for help.

"Hello, Brian, I'm a follower and a subscriber as well as your mother."

Brian - "That's very good to hear.

I... you support me so well and I appreciate that.

I should ask you, Mom, would you consider yourself a gamer?"

Mom - "When I play Mario Kart with, like, grandchildren and things like that, I always

go off the road."

Brian - "That's, but, on purpose to let them feel better."

Mom - "Very similar to my real-life driving skills, I find."

Brian - "I have a list of 181 video games, now I know that's a lot.

I'm basically gonna run through this, and I'm gonna ask you if you have heard of this game.

Red Dead Redemption 2."

Mom - "No."

Brian - "God of War."

Mom - "Yes!

I have heard of that."

Brian - "Oh, OK!"

While subjecting my mom to a litany of 2018's best games,

it became clear that she was very interested in the topic.

Brian - "We're only 57 in, so we've still got another 130 to go."

Mom - "I can't tell you how, what an exciting time this is for me."

Brian - "Now you get taste of what it's like to do my job."

Mom - "I tell you what, this is a lot of research into things that really have very little meaning."

Brian - "You're right.

It is."

So once I had asked my mom about all of the games from the game of the year list, I was

able to throw it into a boolean function.

If mom knows game equals true, then that’s a plus one here.

And then I could raise our base cultural effect to the power of mom, so if she doesn't know

it, that's just to the power of one.

If she does, that's to the power of two.

Finally, it’s time for our fourth, and perhaps most important criteria: Is this game art?

And when you start asking if something is art, then you really end up asking,

"Why should we even be defining what is and isn't art?"

And the only thing worse than discourse about "are games art?" is

the discourse ABOUT the discourse of "are games art?"

Look, art is experiential and that's a beautiful thing that should be allowed to flourish without

having some pseudoscientific proof of greatness thrust upon it.

Which is why I'm not proving greatness.

Instead, this part of the formula is so revolutionary because I am proving art.

So let's go ahead and throw this into...

Shit, I ran out of space.

You know what, this part wasn't that important.

We're just gonna cut it.

This big GOTY equation ends up with very large numbers, which would be too hard to show all of.

So I needed to make a new unit.

Something I could reduce them all down to.

I plugged in my favorite game of the year, Celeste, and I used that to be our new baseline.

Celeste equals one BDG.

Or Big Determinant of Game.

Everything else will be reduced down using Celeste’s score to a scale of BDGs.

So that's it.

That’s the entire formula.

And if you'll excuse me, I have to go do my dark bidding on these spreadsheets and I will

come back to you right now.

December 30th.

New year is at our doorstep.

Knock knock!

Who’s there?

It’s 2019!

Come on in, hope you're not as big of an asshole as the past few of your friends!

I spent the past two weeks crunching the numbers, and it is my honor to announce that

2018’s scientifically calculated game of the year, with 19...

trillion BDGs...

is Fortnite.

That can't be the right number, I'm gonna...

No, that's right.

You remember when Pluto stopped being a planet, and the scientists were like,

"Hey, that's just what the definitions say!"

And we were like,

"Hey, scientists, maybe your definitions are busted!"

Maybe my formula is busted.

The fact that God of War got 2.1 million BDGs and Red Dead Redemption 2 got 0.1 BDG...

Maybe I shouldn't have made my mom's knowledge of the game an exponential factor.

Brian - "You know Tetris.

You would really like this Tetris..."

Mom - *sings the entire Tetris song*

No, I stand by that decision.

Let’s be honest, the stats I was using definitely favored cultural importance, and Fortnite’s

cultural effect was orders of magnitude larger than any other game this year.

And though I've never played Fortnite

— which proves my lack of bias and also that I’m professionally irresponsible —

there can be no denying that it has made a lasting impact

outside of the video game world.

It’s the only nonseries game that my mom knew about.

And regardless of how you feel about the Fortnite, it drew together a collection of people that

might not have otherwise connected, and that’s a valuable thing.

And even when your Uncle Devin comes up to you at the holiday get together and says,

“HEY BRIAN, WHAT IN THE HECK IS THIS FORTNITE THING?”

it gives you a common ground to chat,

and you really haven't chatted with Uncle Devin in a while.

You should call him more often.

He wants to show you his Civil War books.

And his collection of swords.

But if you’re upset, and you didn’t IMMEDIATELY close this YouTube tab to send me an angry tweet,

I’ve got an extra little gift for you.

It's a new formula.

GOTY equals x times 1 quadrillion.

And x equals your favorite game.

Of this year.

Now you can go ahead and tell your friends that Brian scientifically proved that my favorite game

is the game of the year, and then you can share them this link,

and then they won’t click on it because it’s a 15 minute video, so your secret is safe with me.

And to be honest, your favorite game deserves it,

because if you liked it enough to call it your game of the year,

then it must be pretty meaningful to you,

and no one can take that away.

So congratulations, Fortnite, and congratulations, your favorite game.

Here’s hoping 2019 is full of wonderful games and even more wonderful experiences.

*wink*

Happy New Year.

OH.

OH MY GOD THAT IS SO HOT.

OHHH MY GOD.

IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PROP WATER, PAT.

OH I PROBABLY JUST LIKE RUINED THIS MIC, TOO.

JESUS, PAT.

I TOLD YOU IT WAS PROP WATER.

GOD.

I'm okay.

Mom - "Does enthusiasm count or anything like that?

Should it just be, or just be, just bare bones..."

Brian - "Mom, to be honest, I don't think you can do this not enthusiastically, so,

you're gonna be fine." 
 2020-06-25 16:19:14,456 - DEBUG - file running:  PC gaming is a vast ocean of entertainment,

and if you want to explore, all you have to do is sail out.

And speaking of selling out,

this is my first-ever sponsored video!

That's right, the-

the folks over at Riot have decided to corporately sanction

a video from a man who is best known

for hanging sad clown portraits in his apartment.

You see, they just released VALORANT,

and since I'm currently stuck at home

they were kind enough to give me a budget

to help turbocharge my computer,

so that way I could unravel how to get good at PC gaming.

But the thing about VALORANT

is that you don't need a high-end PC to play it.

Riot told me that even on an old clunker

with minimum specs, you can still play competitively.

And sure enough, I excavated my ancient PC

in order to test this, and it played great.

- It plays great.

Oh, that doesn't count.

So I could use that sponsorship money

to soup up my computer or I could use it

to solve one of PC gaming's biggest problems.

Unlike a console, which can plug into a communal TV,

true PC gaming needs a dedicated space.

I live in a three-bedroom apartment with two other roommates

and they are not gonna be cool with me

setting up my sick rig in the spot where we keep

recycling that we haven't taken out in two weeks.

In fact, the only unused personal space I have

is this four-foot square right next to my radiator.

And I like to keep that block unused

for whenever I wanna feel like a rich person.

- Check me out!

But maybe, with a little help from my sponsor...'s money,

I can turn those 16 square feet into a gamer's paradise.

Today I'm teaching you how to make the perfect gamer space.

(lively dance music)

Oh!

Yeah!

For inspiration, I asked a couple coworkers

what they look for in a PC gaming space.

- Hi, I'm Jeff Ramos.

- I'm Julia.

If there was anyone at Polygon who could lead me

to gamer space perfection it would be Jeff and Julia,

and in our discussions it became clear

that there are four major elements

to a good gaming environment.

The first is a solid foundation.

If I want to build a PC gaming space,

where should I start?

- First, I think you need a computer.

- Check!

But without these other foundational elements,

I'll have less of a gamer space

and more of an ominous obelisk.

From there, you can start embellishing your foundation

with element two, a virtual gaming space,

which is just a fancy way of saying

a place you can stream games from.

- It made me feel a little less lonely

as I'm studying and stuff,

because there's just like a voice.

And I guess I wanted to do that for people, also.

- Streaming for you was less about

getting big and it was more about

sharing an experience with your friends.

- If I got big along the way I would be like, "That's fine."

- Element three is aesthetics.

If you're gonna spend hours at your computer,

at the very least it should be nice to look at,

and it should represent you.

- Everything else at my desk is black.

There's very little decoration, and I like that

'cause it's clear mind, I can just focus

on what I'm doing at any given moment,

versus looking at a desk full of Funko Pops.

- I had, I think, this specific Pop figure

of Vi from "League of Legends."

and then it just kind of expanded.

Since I work from home, too,

I try to make my space fun and engaging.

- And the final element: Caters to bodily needs.

- What type of chair is that that you're sitting in?

- Oh, it's a terrible one and it's going to be replaced.

And it gives me consistent back pain.

- Does that affect your gaming at all?

- If I'm not comfortable, then I'm just thinking,

"Dang, my butt hurts, my back hurts,"

and then I can't pay attention to things.

- Do you ever eat near your computer?

Do you ever have to refuel?

- I try to separate eating from my desk space.

There is a space off to the left where I usually

will always have a coffee cup and a water bottle,

and sometimes there'll be like a snack.

- When you're in the throes of a match,

you don't wanna be worried about your back hurting

or feeling a little famished,

and that means your gamer space should provide

the fuel and comfort your body needs.

If you can amalgamate these four elements,

you'll have a good gamer space.

But I'm making the perfect one.

And how can we prove it's perfect?

An increase in gaming performance!

Ha ha, you thought I wasn't gonna do

what I was sponsored to do!

Get outta here, I'm just killin' two birds with one stone!

My coworkers said in no uncertain terms

that a good gamer space will make me a better gamer.

Once I have a dedicated space,

that's gonna be all I'm gonna need

in order to be proficient at this game?

- Well, you should still practice a little bit, I mean--

- Though I normally don't let little things like rules

stand between me and victory,

"Valorant" has anti-cheat software

that kinda makes that impossible,

so there really is no way for me

to get good at this game without practicing.

But a perfect gamer space will envelop me

in a cocoon of learning,

shutting out the world around me.

By the end of this build, I'll prove

that I've developed a perfect gamer space

by showing just how much better at PC gaming I've become.

Luckily, that's not a very high bar.

That doesn't count.

And with my four elements defined, it was time to start.

I taped out the four-by-four square

and purchased a desk that would fit within the perimeter,

built the desk, got the monitor unpacked,

computer, keyboard, mouse in position,

and we were in business.

Element one, check.

I hopped right into "Valorant," and things were going

way better than with my coffee table setup.

And in hindsight,

maybe I should've stopped there.

But I still had money to burn.

You see, I really was getting better at "Valorant,"

but I had no way of clearly showing

just how well I was doing.

And as Jeff said--

- 'Cause if I no-scope and there's no one around to see it,

then does it matter?

- I ordered a nice microphone and got out my old webcam

to set up my streaming space.

All right, check, check.

We are set to go, everything looks great on the... game.

Things do not look as great...

Although I was prepared to start gaming for the masses,

my room was not.

I can do better than this.

If I go live with this setup,

everyone's gonna make fun of my finger-jointed

builder's-grade garbage molding!

I can't be known as the substandard molding guy.

Luckily, I had two sources of inspiration

for gamer space aesthetics on opposite

sides of the spectrum.

I wanted to land somewhere in the middle.

Obviously, the first step

was installing RGB LEDs, because a gamer space

without constantly changing rainbow lights

is like a little league coach without wraparound Oakleys.

I also purchased a modest number of game figurines,

because even with a sponsor,

hoo boy, those things are expensive.

But at the end of this, my space still felt pretty empty,

so I gathered all the figurines I could find.

All of them.

Beyond this, there was nothing behind me

to brand me as a true gamer for the stream viewers,

so I mocked up a quick poster idea

and sent it over to my coworker Pat

for some illustration work,

and used a little bit more of that sponsor money

to purchase a large cloth banner.

Oh my god.

It's perfect.

Finally, I purchased a video game-themed birthday party set,

and with that my aesthetic was complete.

What's up, y'all!

I am back at it at the streaming setup.

We've got everyone here.

You can tell, as I always say back there,

don't talk to me before I've had my gaming.

I just have a little, there's actually nothing in this cup.

I should probably get something into this cup.

Jeff warned me about keeping snacks off my desk,

but I was worried about getting hangry

in the middle of gaming.

So I prepped some peanut butter toast.

Also, Julia had a specific piece of advice

about emotional needs.

- I have one of the guy from Beastars,

so when I get too mad about playing video games

I can look at him and he'll soothe me.

- Though the sight of an anthropomorphic wolf

isn't necessarily soothing to me,

I do think it's important for me to have something

to calm me down after the rough matches:

Warm milk.

And I still had some sponsorship money left over,

so I purchased myself a gamer chair.

Unfortunately, the only one that could ship in time

was the largest size, which meant

I had to rearrange some furniture.

And with that, the perfect gamer space was complete,

all four elements checked.

The gamer space is created,

and all that's left for me to do

is be the gamer within the space.

I played a few matches, taking a sip from the warm milk

any time I got a little flustered.

But for some reason, I wasn't much better

than when I started this journey.

It's just that my wrists hurt.

That's the only reason why things aren't going great.

Even after running to the drugstore

to pick up some compression braces,

my gaming didn't improve.

It didn't make any sense.

I had spent over a week building this gamer space,

which included dozens of minutes playing VALORANT.

Why wasn't I any better?

The space isn't perfect yet.

That's the only explanation.

I hadn't reached my goal of being a better PC gamer.

But I also hadn't run out of sponsor money.

It was time for a second pass.

My single monitor wasn't giving me

enough screen real estate for what really mattered:

My stream setup.

So I got a second one, and also some nice lights.

We have now upgraded our new space.

I can now see my game, and I can also see

what my stream setup's gonna be.

It's lookin' good.

Enough.

But good enough is never enough

when one is striving for perfection.

The problem with streaming is that most people are okay

with one camera and one game.

I am an auteur who understand the importance

of cilimintography, and if I'm supposed to stream

in a manner that matches my ourverver,

I NEED.

MORE.

CAMERAS.

Sadly, pretty much every webcam is currently sold out.

I was running low on time,

and that's one thing sponsor money can't buy.

But it can buy enterprise level

video conferencing solutions.

Just wanted to check in really quickly

to let you know that

I am unstoppable!

*CACKLING*

- [Roommate] Brian!

- Sorry.

I figured out how to do three cams on OBS,

and now I can play a game.

Which is great, except looking at the overlay,

it's a little busy.

Our little test proved that there were

two big issues with our space.

The first was that the cameras took up most of the screen.

The second is that my roommates didn't enjoy hearing me yell,

which is nothing new.

But that's when it hit me.

I have a plan on how to kill two birds with one stone:

By recycling all of the boxes I've received.

If I could create a soundproof box around my gamer space

and cover it in a green screen,

then I'd have more screen space

and my roommates would stop yelling at me.

So I used more of my sponsorship money

to buy a bunch of expensive studio foam,

and I taped it to a bunch of cardboard.

And then I threw a green screen over the top of it

and viola, a hermetically sealed gamer space.

Now, a few of you might be wondering,

"How does one get into this space?"

But you'll see that right behind my air conditioning unit,

there's a way that I can crawl underneath there.

And the best part about it, it's not even dark

because we've got the... I put in the LEDs!

All I have to do is just weasel my way in.

They say, "No pain, no gain."

And you know, I'm a gamer

"No pame, no game."

Maybe that's better than my current slogan.

Oh, get the head through first,

'cause that's the hardest part of it, you know.

Just kinda like...

being born.

Ah, okay.

Oh.

Do a quick one 180.

And then you swap up, and then you're here.

And then you're in the,

(sighs) and then you're in the gamer space.

As easy as pie.

After a vigorous four-minute entrance,

it was clear that things were working out great.

Check this out!

Look, there's so much I can,

you can see the whole UI.

So there is the problem of these screens.

I spend a lot of time trying to make sure

that I had a cool-looking background.

Such is the curse of the green screen.

Though you can put anything behind it,

sometimes you are left with the void.

I worked so hard to make sure

that my background expressed my gamerhood,

and the gamer box just covered it up.

I wanted to digitally recreate it,

but since I had three cameras it would have to be in 3D.

So I reached out to my coworker Jenna

to mock something up in Blender for me,

based on some previous images I had of my gamer space.

Okay, so we just got the new background set up.

Let's get up in here!

Alrighty, okay.

(grunting) Okay!

I can...

Shit.

(groans) My shirt got caught on a thing.

This was a rude awakening, but a necessary one.

My current clothing setup was not compatible

with the gaming rig, so I figured out a new way

to kill two birds with one stone.

The idea came from my compression braces.

My wrists felt so much better while compressed,

and it made me wonder:

What if all of me was compressed?

So I looked up those tactical black skin suits

that athletes wear in the Olympics,

but I was running dangerously low on time and money

so I had to order from a less-than-scrupulous vendor.

And when it finally arrived it was not to my specifications.

I didn't have any more time.

The deadline was fast approaching.

So I dealt with what I had,

crawled into my sweltering gamer space and--

I see what the problem is now.

My new compression suit was causing me

to dissolve into Jenna's wonderful background.

So I asked her to remodel it,

this time with a 3D photorealistic virtual Brian

that I could superimpose my face onto.

And the worst part of it was that--

And I forgot my snacks!

But in all tribulations there is a chance for greatness,

and greatness was found with a little inspiration,

a little heat exhaustion

and the very last of my sponsorship money.

I'm covered head to toe in this important green screen,

and I don't want this to get marred, obviously.

So what I've come up with,

instead of having to eat toast with my hands,

is that I've purchased

a horse feedbag.

And I was worried about, you know,

my hot milk is gonna start to cool down.

And my computer right now is running a little bit hot, too.

Why don't I just kill two birds with one stone?

There are tons of liquid-cooled computers out there,

and if I use this tubing, I can feed the cool milk

through the PC, cooling it down perfectly,

up around my headset, over the microphone.

Okay, I got my feedbag, which will allow me to eat my snacks

and then I've got my warm milk, which is also

gonna be cooling my computer in the box.

I'll have my snacks and I'll have my box,

and I can stay in there.

With the invention of the milk-cooled PC, patent pending,

and the feedback-sustained me, patent pending,

the perfect gamer space was complete.

Okay.

(grunts) Hello!

Gamers.

I have my feedbag, I tossed it over beforehand.

The crown of it all,

my milk-cooled PC.

(Brian panting)

Let's get gamin'.

Thought the feedbag worked wonders,

I was still doing poorly in my matches.

I was getting flustered and couldn't focus,

but that's nothing a little warm milk couldn't help.

Come on! (groans)

See, I don't get, oh, no no no no no, stop!

No no no, uh, shit!

Shit, shit!

Ah!

Oh, this is bad!

This is very bad!

This is very bad!

After mopping up the MILK MSTR's lactose coolant fluid

and toweling myself off,

I broke out the gaming laptop I borrowed from work

and sat back down in my original VALORANT test position.

And I was better.

Without the lights and the monitors

and the hands-free snacks,

I was gaming better on a coffee table

than in my dedicated space.

So did I screw up

and kill too many birds with too few stones?

Or was I a less than perfect gamer?

Perhaps I was asking a toddler to pilot a helicopter.

There's nothing wrong with

my hot cardboard box of gaming perfection.

I simply was not ready to handle it responsibly.

One day, I will reenter that cocoon

and emerge a wonderful gaming butterfly.

But before I grow my wings,

this little grub must learn to crawl.

And also how to defuse the spike without dying.

It seems impossible.

Has anyone done it yet?

I doubt anyone's done that yet.

That's ridiculous.

(cheery music)

Oh, I'm so dumb.

I screwed it in the wrong way.

- [Karen] I didn't wanna say nothin'.

- You didn't wanna say nothin'?

- [Karen] Well, I looked at it and I knew.

- You looked at it and you knew?

- [Karen] Yeah. (laughs)

- And you didn't say nothin'?

No! 
 2020-06-25 16:19:14,456 - DEBUG - file running:  Kingdom Hearts 3 is finally here.

And I have received an excessive amount of requests to explain the storyline.

That seems perfectly reasonable.

You want to be caught up before you hop into the third game.

But judging by the wording on a few of these requests, it seems like I have a…

TALL TASK

ahead of me.

But could I possibly help you understand the gargantuan, magnificent,

epic storyline of Kingdom Hearts?

You sweet summer child.

You babe swaddled in the cashmere blanket of ignorance.

YOU ASK TOO LITTLE OF ME.

Because not only can I help you understand Kingdom Hearts.

But I will give you the tools necessary to understand any story you are ever faced with

for the rest of your life.

*music plays*

Please, oh baby, don’t go.

~Simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonight.~

*CLAP CLAP*

Spoiler Warning!

I’m about to explain the entirety of the Kingdom Hearts series.

Now, if you don’t want to be spoiled for all of the games released up until now…

I don’t know why you clicked on this video.

Because I feel like the title kinda explained that that’s what I was gonna do.

So that’s on you.

Uh, but ALSO.

Potential spoiler warning!

You see, when I explain the tools of the literary trade, I might just be able to accurately

predict the true ending of Kingdom Hearts 3.

Now, the game hasn’t been released yet, and I have not played it, but…

Consider yourself warned.

We’re talking about the hero’s journey or the monomyth.

This is a concept that’s been around for a long time.

But it was popularized by a guy named Joseph Campbell back in 1949 when he released a book

called The Hero with a Thousand Faces.

Campbell inspired plenty of other creative writers and literary analysts, including a

guy called Christopher Vogler, who wrote his own book in the 1990s.

But before that, in the 1980s, he was working as a story consultant for a little company

called Disney.

When he was there, he sent out a seven-page memo that basically broke down all the big

ideas from Campbell’s book into 12 simple steps to writing good stories.

Did the memo work?

I don’t know.

Why don’t you ask Timon and Pumbaa?

They…

They’re from the Lion King.

That was a movie that Disney Produced.

A lot of people think it’s a great movie.

Kingdom Hearts as described by the monomyth.

We’ve got 12 stages up here, kinda like a clock.

It’s a story wheel.

And I’ll go through piece by piece explaining Kingdom Hearts 1, so that way you can understand

what these stages are.

Once you do understand these stages, you’ll be able to understand any story!

Because great writers, no matter how dense their sci-fi or fantasy world may be, use

these stages to help orient you.

I’m talking Dune.

Harry Potter.

Space Jam.

Number one, introduction in the ordinary world.

In Kingdom Hearts 1, this is when Sora, Riku, and Kairi are all just hanging out on Destiny

Islands, doing normal kid stuff.

Call to adventure.

What’s this?

Weird creatures showing up on the island?

Sora has a sword that’s also a key?

Refusal of the call.

Now we hit a bit of a hiccup here because he really does seem gung-ho to leave the island

at some point.

But I don’t think he wanted to do it on these terms, so I’ll still call this a refusal.

Meeting with the mentor.

At this point Sora is in Traverse Town, and he meets Leon, who ends up giving him some

guidance on what he’s supposed to be doing.

Crossing the threshold.

Or as true literary critics call it…

boarding the gummi ship.

Tests, allies, and enemies.

This is pretty much the entirety of the Disney worlds.

You’ll notice that a lot of times in these synopses of Kingdom Hearts,

people just skip over them.

It’s cause they all fit here.

Reaching the innermost cave.

This is such a pivotal moment in the story.

In Star Wars, this is when Luke goes into the cave and faces off against a shadow version

of himself.

And in Kingdom Hearts, this is when Sora goes into Hollow Bastion so he can fight Riku, who is

actually being possessed by Ansem, who is the Heartless version of Terra-Xehanort, who

was originally Terra but was then possessed by Xehanort before him.

Same thing.

Enduring the supreme ordeal.

After Sora has faced off against Ansem the first time, he has to stab his own heart with

a keyblade, so that way he can release it and save Kairi.

That’s a supreme ordeal.

Seizing the sword.

Now this is not a literal sword.

Obviously, Sora already has one of those.

But instead it’s the reward or the power that Sora can take with him.

So in this case, it’s him being resurrected, having all of the princesses of heart saved,

and having the power to defeat Ansem.

The road back.

Ansem has been defeated by Kingdom Hearts being opened and him being ripped apart by

the light.

And they are able to seal the doors, but unfortunately, they lose two of their friends in the process.

Resurrection.

Yeah, Sora did get literally resurrected a few stages before this.

Uh, but this is more of a metaphysical resurrection.

Them finally coming back from the brink.

Kairi going back to Destiny Islands.

Return with the elixir.

Sora, Donald, and Goofy all go back out, using their combined experience to try to save Mickey

and Riku.

And that's Kingdom Hearts!

That was pretty painless, don't you think?

But granted, that's not what people have an issue with.

People have an issue with all of the overarching story of Kingdom Hearts.

But, again, as long as we stick to these 12 stages, we should be able to take this apart,

piece by piece.

And though I am gonna stick with the 12 stages, I am gonna add just, uh, one little extra piece.

It's called historical background.

This is like The Silmarillion.

Or JK Rowling's twitter.

In Kingdom Hearts, this would be Union Cross, or Chi, or whatever the many names of this

web/mobile game ended up being.

Die-hard fans will get upset with me if I say this doesn't really matter to Sora's overarching story.

But I'm gonna say it anyway.

So this historical background is gonna just be up here.

And all of that knowledge is just gonna kind of bleed immediately into Kingdom Hearts 1.

Pat (offscreen): Uh, nope, you gotta do Birth by Sleep.

Pat: It's a prequel.

Brian: But, is Sora in it?

Pat: No.

No Sora.

Brian: Who's this guy, then?

Pat: That's Vanitas.

Brian: Why?

So I, uh, seem to have neglected, uh, like three other heroes' journeys in this hero's journey.

So I'm just gonna...

I'm gonna move these over a little bit so that way I can have a bit more space.

We, we do have to talk about Birth by Sleep.

Starting first with Terra's.

Um, now imagine it has all twelve of the stages of the hero's journey, I just didn't want

to write 'em all out, 'cause he gets norted, so he's not that good of a hero.

Same goes for Aqua, which is intersecting with Terra's.

And then we've got Ventus, who has the biggest bearing on Sora's hero's journey.

It means that it has to not only intersect over here with Terra and Aqua.

But, I'm sorry Vogler, I am gonna have to include another step on your hero's journey.

So here we've got the Ventus Diagram, uh, which intersects here at step point five.

The part of the hero's journey, uh, where the baby hero's heart goes and saves another boy.

That's the only big change we're gonna do to Vogler's story wheel.

Uh, everything else is gonna make sense in Kingdom Hearts.

And now we're going to take the wheel, uh, as if it is the overarching story of the entirety

of the games.

So Kingdom Hearts, the first one, instead of going from 1 all the way to 12, is actually

just gonna go from 0.5 to 5.

And then we start 5 immediately at Kingdom Hearts 2, which will begin with Sora...

Pat (offscreen): Nope.

Brian: What do you mean nope?

Pat: There's two more.

Once again I seem to have neglected a few, uh, interstitial pieces of Kingdom Hearts.

Chain of Memories and also three five eight days over two.

Which is a totally normal title.

It's totally fine, because it just fleshes out Sora's hero's journey.

And also... a different guy and his name is Roxas.

*pained expression*

I went ahead and I categorized Chain of Memories as a "hero's journey redux"

since Sora is just fighting against his own memories, the things that he has remembered

from the past hero's journey.

So it's just gonna hang out around here.

And then we have 358/2 Days, which follows Roxas, who is Sora's Nobody.

And a Nobody is like the shell of a person after they've released their heart.

358/2 Days happens then, and since it's the hero's Nobody, it's actually within the hero's

journey, doing its own thing.

Um, and, I'm gonna call this 4.5 remix.

This is a pivotal part of the hero's journey when, uh, the hero's shadow self goes off

and eats ice cream.

These two are tied together by a character named Xion, who works in Organization XIII

with Roxas, and also is made from the memories... of Sora.

She doesn't really have like a hero's journey...

I'll just tie it out for you.

And since this oblong actually crosses through the hero's journey twice, we're gonna make

this easy to remember and call it the

"Hero's Memories of the Hero's Journey Double Cross Oblong."

Or HMHJXXO.

In Kingdom Hearts 2, we start out with Roxas and Sora, and Roxas is on summer vacation.

We're gonna have him start over here and just kind of go all the way up to enduring the

supreme ordeal, where he finally gives up his body to Sora so Sora can be whole.

And we're just gonna call that "The Antihero's Cradle."

Alright, so, we're done with Roxas, we're back with Sora.

So this should be a breeze.

Kingdom Hearts 2.

Alright, he's already crossed the threshold.

He does the tests, allies, and enemies.

That's just the Disney stuff, we're gonna skip it.

He goes over, reaches the innermost cave, that would be the World that Never Was, where

he faces off against the supreme ordeal.

Xemnas, Organization XIII.

Seizes the sword.

He gets the power to close Kingdom Hearts.

And then finally, the road back.

They get home.

They get a letter from King Mickey, the contents of which will be revealed in...

Kingdom Hearts 3?

Pat (offscreen): No.

FUCK!

ALRIGHT ASSHOLES.

I have no more space here, so I made you a DATA CUBE.

ARE YA HAPPY?

The data cube contains the entirety of Kingdom Hearts Coded, which is all in a virtual space.

The data cube is that thing where the hero goes on a journey into his inner thoughts

and finds some data that an old guy put in him.

It's that THING THAT HAPPENS IN THE HERO'S JOURNEY.

And then at the same time, we also have Dream Drop Distance, which... is another hero's

journey inside of the hero's journey, and it's part of seizing the sword.

Because they have to go... into sleeping versions of the world's they've already been to.

But also maybe they're... they're going into each other's dreams?

And one of them is...

No, it doesn't fit here, I've got a better...

There's another part of the hero's journey, and it's called the Dream Drop Bucket.

And it's where you put the Dream Drop Distance until you need it later, and hopefully you won't.

That brings us up to Kingdom Hearts 3.

Granted, I thought when I started this, I would be able to...

perfectly predict, uh, Kingdom Hearts 3.

But, I don't know, I feel like I"m just missing something.

*CAUSE He GeTs NOrTEd.*

*BeING POsESSed bY AnSEM.*

*By XeHAnORT.*

*CAUSE HE GETS NORTED.*

I forgot about the villain's journey.

The villain's tridecagon.

The villain's tridecagon is definitely the key.

The tridecagon of villainy.

This is a 13-sided shape that goes one further than dodecagon of the hero's journey.

We have almost entirely ignored Xehanort.

He is the impetus for all of the anger and anguish in Sora's life.

And so he deserves a wheel as well.

We have to start at the very beginning of Xehanort.

And that starts in stage one of all villains.

You have to be contacted by a future version of yourself.

That brings us to stage two.

It gives you the ability to time travel.

And that's what this means.

This special string just shows that they can go wherever they want to in time.

Step three, you need to learn about a great power.

This is when Xehanort first discovers Kingdom Hearts and all of the power it could hold.

What do you do after you find out about that power?

You nort a boy.

Once you've got that boy under your possession, time to get real into unethical science.

That's when you're going to learn all about Kingdom Hearts and how to release people's hearts.

That means you can become a guinea pig yourself, therefore creating two versions of yourself.

A Nobody and a Heartless.

But are you happy with just those two versions of yourself?

You shouldn't be!

'Cause you're a villain.

That's right, it's time for nort boy redux.

Stage eight.

This is when Ansem, the Heartless version of Terra-Xehanort, the original norted boy

form, takes control of Riku.

And now that you're jazzed and ready to go, time to fail.

You do have to fail once, uh, in order to succeed later as a villain.

But don't let that failure get you down, it's time for stage 10.

You develop an organization to trick young boy into committing Heartless genocide in order to create

a new pseudo version of that great power you discovered back in stage three.

And then you fail again.

But guess what!

It's time travel time.

Your young self is gonna help you out by coming from over in step two to step 12.

You just do the same tenth step again, except instead of using other people, you use 13

versions of your own self.

Which leads us to the thirteenth point in the tridecagon.

The villain's variable.

You're either gonna win, or you're gonna lose.

This is the thing that we were missing.

The villain's variable is what will tie together the rest of story.

It's what will help us understand what will happen in Kingdom Hearts 3.

And judging by the villain's tridecagon, I can say that I don't believe Sora will seal

away the darkness.

In fact I expect Xehanort to win...

by norting Sora.

And then think of the repercussions of this.

Donald will kill Goofy by throwing him off a dock.

Riku will start cutting his own bangs.

Kairi will continue to not matter.

It's so much more interesting.

It's the true way that this story should end.

And I think this is what people want.

This is the modern hero's journey.

The true thing that all stories should follow from here on out.

As Utada Hikaru would say: Simple and clean.

So the next time someone tells you, "I don't understand Kingdom Hearts!"

You say, "Hey Bucko.

I think what you don't understand is basic storytelling."

Basic storytelling.

Did that work?

I don't know.

Ask...

Aladdin.

Did the memo work?

Why don't you ask Sebastian the crab. *sings Under the Sea*

You nort a boy.

*laughing*

Pat (offscreen): Ohhh no. 
 2020-06-25 16:19:14,457 - DEBUG - file running:  *cheerful music*

Kirby!

This pink puffball has been sucking his way through the denizens of Dream Land since 1992.

He has his own games, manga, tv series, and toys.

It’s safe to say he’s one of Nintendo’s most trusted mascots.

But he should not be trusted.

The problem with Kirby is that he is simultaneously Nintendo’s simplest and most powerful creature.

Those two realities cannot coexist.

He is a life form with neither the ambition nor the intelligence to make decisions,

and yet the world bends to his will.

Although it appears that Kirby is just a vacuous pastel marshmallow,

there must be some hidden wisdom that grants him the power he wields.

There has to be.

Kirby’s incongruity is terrifying,

but that’s only because we are terrified of things we do not yet understand.

And today, we are going to understand.

"Scientia potentia est.” Knowledge is Power.

Humankind’s attempts to harness the powers of the natural world

come from intense research and understanding of those powers.

And yet Kirby is granted powers well beyond his station.

What powers, you ask? Allow me to show you.

I have created two columns here: Simplicity, and Power.

What Kirby is, versus What Kirby can do.

By mapping the dichotomy of these two columns, we can peel back the facade of Kirby’s simplicity,

and figure out what’s really going on.

Because, again, this is not normal.

Let’s begin with simplicity.

Most people know Kirby as that cute little round guy, but is there more to him?

According to official, canonical information:

no.

Does this sound like an apex predator?

Even a bear enjoys a satisfying back-scratch.

This sounds like the lowest form of life,

someone who is stuck on the base of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs.

He wakes up, eats his caloric intake for the day,

and falls asleep watching The Great British Bake Off.

And yet, over here on the power column...

The things Kirby eats are completely obliterated.

Not just converted into something else, completely gone.

Kirby only cares about eating and sleeping.

And yet, he gains no energy nor pleasure from consuming these things.

Instead, he just lets them disappear.

Gone from this plane of existence.

So…

what the fuck.

Kirby doesn’t speak a language beyond saying the words “Poyo,”

and “Hi!”

Kirby mostly communicates via body language and grunts.

Even toddlers are more communicative.

By all accounts, he is either incapable of, or uninterested in, speaking language.

And yet Kirby is an incredibly skilled technician.

We see Kirby piloting mechs, and if anime is to believed,

and I believe anime,

this can only be accomplished by gifted teens grappling with psychosexual ennui.

He can effortlessly turn himself into a fighter jet,

something that only the most skilled air force engineers have mastered.

How can he understand these complex mechanical processes,

without having the language skill to read a textbook

or the "I fucking love science" facebook page?

Kirby’s origins are vague.

Let me take a moment to move over to a different board so I can show you Kirby’s origin story.

There’s NOTHING HERE.

Very little is known about Kirby’s origin.

He has no canonical species. He has no canonical age.

Masahiro Sakurai, Kirby’s alleged creator,

has stated he does not remember how Kirby got his name.

Kirby was originally a placeholder sprite,

set to be replaced by something....

More!

But no. Kirby survived. Kirby came from nothing.

And Kirby is nothing.

Or is he everything.

Because Kirby can be anything.

His copy ability gives him the powers and appearance of any creature he consumes.

But copy is a misnomer.

He does not duplicate his enemies.

He assimilates and replaces them.

In Smash, he takes the power of his foes, and then the foe is released as a sign of respect.

But in every other iteration of Kirby, the thing he consumes is destroyed in the process.

Does he absorb their DNA? Does he absorb their memories?

Is he the keeper of their souls?

All of these abilities point to Kirby being intelligently designed, which we know is not the case.

Sakurai fucking woke up in a crop circle with the name “Kirby” carved into his arm.

Kirby has no emotional intelligence. No relationships.

In the anime, Kirby seems to harbor no ill will toward King Dedede or Escargoon,

his main two antagonists.

He faces baby birds and full battalions of soldiers with the same vacant grin.

He eats and destroys indiscriminately, but counts no one among his enemies.

But those who count him among theirs…

are cosmic horrors.

Look at this thing.

Look at this thing!

These celestial powers probably have wants and needs far beyond our human comprehension,

and yet they trouble themselves with the destruction of Kirby,

a barely living kickball.

What do they see in Kirby that scares them?

What could scare this?

And the final simple evidence, Kirby is shaped like a friend.

This was the opening of Kirby’s Adventure. Let me show you something.

What did you notice?

That’s right. For the entire time I was drawing this,

I WASN’T INTERROGATING the true nature of Kirby.

This quote is cute and simple and a blatant misdirection.

It is a patronizing errand is meant to keep people like me from uncovering the truth.

The truth that Kirby possesses infinite power.

And that is a quote.

Planet Robobot explicitly states that Kirby possesses infinite power.

Kirby can ride a star. Kirby can punch through a planet.

Kirby is the only being in the entirety of the universe that survived the Galeem cataclysm.

A circle survived.

THIS SURVIVED.

HOW?

*deep breath*

Now that we’ve addressed these two columns, it is time to bridge the gap.

How can we reconcile the two canonical truths of Kirby:

that he is both nothing and everything.

How can this sentient garbage bag accomplish so much?

Let me tell you...

I don’t know.

I literally have no clue how this dumb fucking orb can have so much power.

I have worked my whole life researching and gaining knowledge,

and this dipshit sphere sleeps all day and has powers that gods fear.

And that’s impossible.

It should be impossible.

There has to be an answer here and I don’t see it and that’s NOT FAIR.

If knowledge is power, then power should be knowledge,

and Kirby is everything and he should know everything,

and yet we know nothing!

I can’t think in here.

I’m going outside!

How do I get outside?

Kirby!

The mystery of this florid Dream Landian has baffled me,

but I've taken a few months, and I've collected my thoughts,

and I’m back in the studio to deliver my findings.

Kirby’s incongruity is terrifying, but that’s only because we are terrified of things we do not yet understand.

And today, for real,

we are going to understand.

If you’ll recall from our first exploration of the rosy nightmare,

the problem with Kirby is that he is both incredibly simple and incredibly powerful.

In the intervening five months, I’ve learned a few pieces of information that contradict a few of my points.

First, Kirby can speak a language.

There was a Drama CD released in Japan in 1994 where Kirby speaks full sentences.

But in this, he says that a phone is “mysterious” and he doesn’t know how it works.

And yet, he can pilot a mech.

Two, Kirby’s name does in fact have a backstory,

even if Sakurai was too fuckin' zooted to remember it.

Kirby was named after John Kirby, a lawyer who passed away last year,

who defended Nintendo’s right to copyright Donkey Kong back in the ‘80s.

But this doesn’t make the rest of Kirby's origin any less vague,

and it doesn't change the fact that a creature cannot possibly embody both of these truths.

But that’s the problem.

I’ve been thinking of Kirby as a creature.

Consider, for a moment, Moby Dick.

You might receive this book in your English class and say,

"Hell yeah! A big ol’ whale?

I can’t wait to see Ahab level up and hit that big boy right in his weak points.

And sure, he puts his harpoon up in Moby D’s flanks,

but spoiler alert!

Ahab gets got,

even though he’s been grinding for, like, years

and Pale Whale's just a dipshit fish with a thing for sailor feet.

And so you say this to Ms. Mahoney and she’s like,

“Brian, don’t you get it? The whale is a metaphor for…

something,”

and then you write that on your final exam and you pass the class.

This is what I like to call “The Bookman’s Bluff.”

It’s when an author creates something, and people are like,

“Hey, that doesn’t make sense,”

but then the author says,

“Well, it does make sense if you consider it’s actually a metaphor.”

Here, I believe that Sakurai is pulling a Bookman’s Bluff.

Kirby, like Moby Dick, doesn’t make sense as a creature,

but he will make sense as a metaphor.

So what does Kirby symbolize?

Let’s take a look at some common metaphors.

Let's start with the seven deadly sins since everyone and their mother is basing characters on them.

Unfortunately, none of them really make sense for Kirby.

Wrath, no way. Greed, he’s not in it for the money.

I'm gonna skip over lust.

You could make an argument for Gluttony because he eats a lot.

Sloth, he sleeps a lot. And Envy, he's constantly copying other people.

But he never does it with any malice. Kirby does these things haphazardly,

without any sense of what he's doing.

And then there’s Pride.

Now, pride is the sin from which all other sins arise,

and its punishment in hell is being broken upon the wheel,

but Kirby is a wheel, so that ain’t gonna work.

But Kirby might symbolize someone else’s pride...

The Hubris of Humanity.

Think about it.

Has humanity ever paused to consider that perhaps our endless consumption

may not be a good move for the world as a whole?

Have we altered our course or simply continued to eat and sleep and copy others

without any thought of the repercussions?

In fact, perhaps we can go one step further. Kirby is a metaphor for capitalism!

Does our capitalist society assimilate and destroy?

Absolutely!

Technical and cultural appropriation are two of capitalism’s most trusted tools.

When it comes to a lack of emotional intelligence,

capitalism makes people willing to suck in and obliterate anything,

friend or foe, nation or natural wonder, so long as it makes money.

Is capitalism’s enemy a cosmic horror?

What could be more cosmically horrifying to a capitalist society

than a guy called Marx.

KIRBY IS A METAPHOR FOR CAPITALISM.

Sure, capitalism can sometimes be more cruel in its intentions than Kirby can manage.

That is... I'll take that.

Uh, also, it sure as hell feels like it could burn out at any second,

so the infinite power thing: not 100% true.

Um, and,

very-it's a-it’s hard to describe capitalism as being shaped like a friend…

and the whole eating and sleeping only is...

it doesn’t really make sense 'cause we have a hyper fixation on productivity and that being tied to worth…

so that doesn't...

This is not a very good metaphor, is it?

In fact, most of these metaphors are bullshit.

Especially this one.

I thought I could take five months and pause and contemplate,

and then I'd come back, and I'd have the perfect explanation for the dichotomy of Kirby,

but nothing has changed.

This horrifying bolus slips through my fingers again.

Maybe I’m just not good at this...

Jenna, can you...

I need you to keep my papers and push pins safe. I’m gonna go away for awhile…

I'm gonna find Kirby.

Jenna: Okay. Good luck bud.

I went to the woods because I wished to front only the essential facts of Kirby.

I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life,

just as Kirby might suck a Waddle Dee into his gullet.

I’ve been at it for a while now.

Judging by the length of my beard, I’ve been living out here for 2, maybe 3 years?

There are no pin boards in the forest.

I don’t have three cameras to catch my every side glance.

They don't teach you th...

It’s just me. And nature,

which has reduced me to my base instincts.

I only care about finding food and shelter,

eating and sleeping.

I am become Kirby.

I wish I could say this has given me a clear mind, but no,

nature has broken me.

I am confounded by it.

And we are terrified of things we do not yet understand.

Kirby is nature!

...I thought, after spending my first day out in the woods.

Sure, nature’s origins are still murky,

and what is evolution if not a really, really slow form of Kirby’s copy ability?

*inhaling*

And much like Kirby, Nature is neither cruel nor kind:

it doles out boons and punishments indiscriminately.

For every delicious handful of berries,

it also gives a completely unrelated bout of diarrhea.

But it took me only a few days to realize that this was another dead end.

Nature doesn’t destroy matter, or possess infinite power,

and its enemy is not a cosmic horror,

it’s us.

I'm sorry for using so much paper.

So I went back to the proverbial drawing board and have been stuck there ever since.

Nature is still terrifying to me.

And it is certainly not shaped like a friend.

How can Kirby live like this and stay so joyful?

How can he only care about his base needs and conquer any enemies that come before him?

I can’t conquer anything,

not even the mystery of a character from a children’s game.

All I can do is tumble listlessly through the wood,

like a star spat from Kirby’s maw.

*waves crashing*

I awake one morning upon the shore of a strange sea.

I do not know where I am, nor how I came to be here.

The sea stretches endlessly in front of me,

revealing the gentle, Kirby-like curve of the planet,

and I finally understand.

I was so focused on investigating the inner machinations of this bulbous boy

that I never asked why I was investigating.

I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things to mean something,

but Kirby didn’t need an explanation,

I did.

There is no bullet point or fan wiki entry.

Kirby is not nature or a metaphor.

Kirby doesn’t need a dark backstory or a logical rationale.

Kirby is just Kirby.

As I stand here watching the waves lap against the sand

miles away from civilization,

I realize I’m not simply standing on the edge of the ocean, but the edge of the world.

A world I’ve accepted without knowing its hidden meaning.

Perhaps there is no hidden meaning.

Perhaps it’s better that way.

Perhaps it’s time for me to go home.

“First you draw a circle,

then you dot the eyes.

Add a great big smile,

and presto, it’s Kirby.”

Kirby is an extremely strong circle,

and that’s all the explanation I need.

Unfortunately,

the same CANNOT BE SAID FOR DIDDY KONG.

WHO GAVE HIM A GUN? DID HE BUILD THE JETPACK?

THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE, HE'S A MONKEY, WHAT IS HE...

*suit ripping* Ahhh yeah!

This is satisfying. If you get in on this, you want to...

Pat: Yeah.

Brian: Roll... just put that in a bunch of dirt right now.

I'm gonna roll around a little bit.

*you hear a bunch of scrounging around*

*shirt ripping* Brian: Ohhhh incredible!

Pat: Are we gonna ride on the train like this to Coney Island?

Brian: Yeah maybe! 
 2020-06-25 16:19:14,457 - DEBUG - file running:  Mario!

He can jump, he can dance,

and he can successfully avoid conviction for war crimes.

It seems like the only thing he can’t do is settle down and just enjoy life for a bit.

Mario has been cleaning up messes in the Mushroom Kingdom and beyond since 1981.

That makes him almost 40 years old.

Most 40-year-olds I know are paying off a mortgage, buying a Peloton,

and desperately trying not to become their parents.

But Mario is still out there,

grinding at the same job,

and also, every other job.

Doesn’t Mario deserve some time off?

Doesn’t he get a chance to kick up his heels?

Enjoy a tropical drink while visiting the ol’ timeshare?

And more specifically, hasn’t he made enough coins to let him coast for the rest of his life?

That’s why I’m here to give him a little financial advice…

*ding!*

And figure out when Mario can retire.

*chalk board wheeling in*

Thank you both.

Why should Mario retire?

You might say “Mario loves his job,

and when you love what you do, you never work a day in your life,”

but that's bullshit.

I love what I do, and let me tell you something…

I’ve worked some days.

*threatening bass noise*

I personally can’t wait to retire.

As soon as I hit 50, I'm gonna be out there on the beach,

pina colada in one hand, sci-fi novel in the other,

soaking up mother nature's cosmic rays.

But Mario has a history of risk-taking behavior, and

it's possible he's planning to live fast, die young, and leave a beautiful, beautiful corpse.

That said, he’s made it out of every scrape so far,

and ground pounding at age 86 is hard on the hips.

Mario needs a backup plan.

Now, I’m not here to tell Mario how to live his life

*ding*

but I can take a look at his finances

and figure out when he’ll have enough money to finally hand Peach his resignation letter.

Foolish ol’ me thought that I could just google “how much money do you need to retire”

and there'd be a link that says “a million bucks,”

but no.

Turns out that everyone needs a different amount to retire based on what you’re used to.

If you’re making millions every year, you’re gonna need a lot more to retire,

because how else are you gonna support your dipshit failson’s bad business ideas?

But with all of the retirement calculators online, I was getting a little overwhelmed,

so I decided to reach out to a qualified financial advisor.

- Hi, my name’s Nate Choe, I’m a certified financial planner with Northwestern Mutual,

and I basically help people answer questions about money.

- That’s exactly what I need you to do today.

This call is not about me, um, I feel like I’m in a great spot right now in terms of my finances,

but I have some worries about my good friend, Mario.

I was looking online to see if there was, like, just a number of money you need in order to retire,

and it turns out that that’s not a thing that exists.

How do I figure out how much money you need to retire?

- Yeah, yeah, um, there are a lot of different things that you’d need to know.

At the most basic level, you need to know how many years you’re going to spend in retirement.

So basically, when you’re gonna retire, and at what age you’re going to die.

- So I have know, I have to be able to, uh,

to just discern when I’m willing to croak, is what you’re saying.

- Exactly, yes, you have to calculate a death at some point.

- Alright. What if I’m never gonna die.

- *chuckling* Then you’re never going to be able to retire.

And then you’ll need to know how much money you’re going to spend every single month…

- Okay…

- And then Nate listed off a bunch of other very important pieces of retirement info

and I paid close attention.

- Got it, okay.

I figure out how much money he’s gonna need per month, and then I’ll work backward from that,

based on how much money he can accrue, and then that will be how I can figure out when he can retire?

- That work backwards model is actually what we do in the industry,

but we have to offset what he has against inflation as well.

- Is there a minimum amount of money per month that you suggest people have for retirement?

- Yeah, typically, what we’re talking about, like, the average American,

it’s going to be about three thousand dollars a month, of today’s dollars.

- I feel like Mario is a very humble man,

and so I don’t think he’s going to need more than 3k a month, um,

just to make it easier for me.

So now that I’ve got a basic gist of the information I need to calculate Mario’s retirement age,

it’s time to collect the information.

Let’s start with something easygoing

and figure out when Mario's gonna die.

To keep things simple, we’ll assume that Mario was born the year he first made a game appearance.

This might not be perfectly accurate, but it would make him almost 39 years old,

and that feels pretty right for a strangely smooth-skinned mustachioed man.

Though current male life expectancy is around 80 years old,

I personally can’t come to grips with the fact that Mario is halfway through his life,

so I’ll be generous and say he’ll die at 90.

He’s spry.

In order to retire, Mario is going to need a monthly budget of at least three thousand US dollars,

but he uses coins.

Tons and tons of people have tried to figure out, how much a coin would be worth in US dollars,

but most of them have been thinking about coins as a solid gold object.

Judging by the amount of coins you need to purchase simple objects in the Mushroom Kingdom,

it seems like coins are not really worth that much.

Using Super Mario RPG as our guideline for a coin’s purchasing power,

the cheapest items are a mushroom and able juice: 4 coins a pop.

Shirt and pants are the cheapest nonconsumable items at 7 coins each.

I wanted to compare these with the most expensive items in Super Mario RPG,

but I don’t think I can figure out the real world price of a fire bomb

without getting put on a watch list.

After doing some heavy research, I settled on a conversion rate of 1 coin to 8 US Dollars.

Given our 3k figure for retirement,

that just means Mario needs 375 coins a month, right?

WRONG.

Super Mario RPG came out in 1996, and we haven’t accounted for inflation.

That’s why we gotta compare these prices to similar items Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga,

which came out seven years later.

I built my Mushroom Price Index on these six items, and just from a cursory glance,

it’s obvious that the prices have gone up.

But to figure out by how much, we gotta head back to algebra two.

The pert equation!

It's something I learned about a very long time ago,

and I’m pretty sure it’s used to figure out compounding interest.

Basically, I gotta plug in some prices and do some natural logs and

whatever else the internet tells me to do,

and it will leave me with an annual inflation rate for that item.

Then I just gotta average out the rates and it’ll leave me with a workable annual inflation rate

for the Mushroom Kingdom as a whole.

So I’ll just go ahead and do that math in my head real quick.

*thinking music*

Thank you, Clayton.

Now, rounding that number up, that’s an average annual inflation rate of about 15% per year.

Which is… really high.

The US Federal Reserve tries to keep inflation at a healthy 2%,

whereas the Mushroom Kingdom Federal Reserve doesn’t exist

due to aggressive lobbying by Wario.

In order to understand this a bit better, I googled Mario hyperinflation,

and I got some exciting search results

that were ultimately unhelpful.

But from what I gather, this means that if Mario spends 100 coins to buy a shirt this year,

next year, he'll have to spend a little more than 115 for the same shirt.

If inflation stayed the same from when Superstar Saga came out in 2003,

we can assume that by 2020, a simple mushroom is going to cost 128 coins.

A pair of entry level pants will cost 2049 coins.

So that original 1-to-8 conversion rate doesn’t really make sense anymore.

Using those same 2020 price comparisons,

the conversion rate is more like 36 coins to 1 US Dollar.

If Mario retired today, he would need 108,000 coins per month.

*MAMMA MIA!*

But let’s remember that Mario has been doing this for a long time. He’s definitely got a little something...

... away. So I talked to Nate about his job and ways he might be saving money.

- He has a bit of a strange job. He’s technically a plumber, I guess, in title?

- Is he part of, like, the plumber’s union? Does he have a pension?

- So I, I, I would be willing to bet he doesn’t have a pension just because, uh,

I think he might be the only plumber?

He’s not being employed by anyone, necessarily. He’s just doing it and then finding his payment along the way.

- Okay, so it sounds like he’s almost, like, a freelancer.

If he’s not getting W-2 income he can’t save into things like 401ks or Roth IRAs.

- Now, when you say Roth IRA, what is that?

- It’s a way to save for retirement.

Um,

you know, as a young person you should definitely be doing one, trying to max it out every single year.

It’s crucial for, for retirement.

- When…

But when you say crucial, do you…

do you mean optional?

So, maybe Mario doesn’t have a Rough IRA or a 4-in-1 Cake or whatever,

but no one has those. I don’t, and I’m well on my way to that beach chair in Boca!

And the fact is that Mario can get a lot of coins in his games.

How else could he spend so much on go-karting and tennis?

In the most recent Mario games, the coin counter can only go up to 9,999,

which is the maximum amount you can store in a mattress.

So let’s assume that Mario has been saving 10,000 coins every year since the release of Mario Odyssey.

We can assume that since he’s not in a union, he isn’t getting any raises to offset inflation.

So to finally figure out when Mario can retire, we need to know much money he’ll need every year before his death.

For example, if he lives to 90 years old, he’ll need 2.7 billion coins.

Which is the cost of living for just one year.

But we have to remember that he's been saving 10,000 coins for 54 years,

which means that he would have 540 thousand coins saved up… Which is…

point zero two percent

of what he needs to retire for just one year before his death.

And actually, if the monthly cost of living is already 108 thousand coins,

he's gonna be unbelievably deep in debt…

Which is actually what Nate told me, via text.

Mario can never retire.

You know what, that’s bonkers though, because there's...

there’s no way that, you know, inflation's gonna stay that high for that long.

In fact, in later Mario and Luigi RPGs, the prices are the same or lower.

So let’s just assume that from here on out the inflation rate stays a healthy 2%.

And you know what, let’s assume that Mario can save more than 10,000 coins a month.

In New Super Mario Bros. 2, the counter maxes out at one less than 10 million coins.

Granted, this is an outlier, and a ridiculous one at that,

but so is spending 2.7 billion coins just to survive at age 90.

There’s no way you could spend that much on Werther’s Originals.

So let’s say he's saving 10 million coins a year since age 31,

which, might I point out, is over a quarter of a million US Dollars.

Now if we just add up the cost of living of each year leading up to 90,

we can see that Mario will have saved enough money to chill out on his boat at age…

77.

Which is...

is just one year below the average American male life expectancy…

*I'M-A TIRED!*

Okay, you know what,

just for fun, let's just throw some random numbers in here, just to... just for...

just to see, you know, just wheaa- just for fun!

Let’s say Mario is starting to save money at, ppffff, I don’t know, my age, 26.

The inflation rate can stay the same, 2%,

and let's just say that the coin ratio is actually just 1-to-1 with US dollars,

so just he needs 3,000 coins today in order to retire.

And, and you know what, let’s, let's say he can save….

uhhh, psshhh, 10% of an average video producer’s salary in New York City.

Something completely random like that.

Assuming Mario lives to the ripe old age of 90,

we can just plug these figures into the equation

and figure out that Mario will be kickin' back on the white sands,

boombox blastin' Jimmy Buffett at the youthful retirement age of...

88?

Are you fucking kidding me?

Nononono... That can’t be right…

Because if Mario can’t retire,

then that would mean that I wo-

*uncomfortable silence*

Will you excuse me for a moment…

*tropical music playing in the background*

*Another day in paradise!*

*The sun is shining bright!*

*People laugh and people smile, 'cause everything feels alright!*

In order to understand this a little better, I googled Mario hyperinfla- *laughing* I just,

I'm sorry, I'm just accepting this now. I'm just accepting what I'm saying. 
 2020-06-25 16:19:14,457 - DEBUG - file running:  The Mega Man robot masters were not always evil.

In fact, most were mechanized workers, created specifically to make life on Earth more efficient

and wonderful.

AND THEN THAT MASSIVE DONGER,

DR. WILY, TURNED ‘EM ON US!

So Mega Man destroyed them, and the world was saved.

But... just how useful were these robots?

And were they useful enough to chance a robot uprising?

What if someone ranked every single Mega Man robot master from most to least useful to

see which ones were really worth the risk.

Someone should try to do that.

It’s me.

I’m the one who’s going to do that.

Before I get started on the gradient of worth it to not worth it, I’m gonna talk

about the protagonists, or “the good guys” even though some of them aren’t specifically good.

A lot of these robots were built to be sentient for the sake of being sentient, and I do not

feel at all qualified to discuss the philosophical implications of that.

So I’m gonna put ‘em over here.

Mega Man.

Mega Man X.

Mega Man red.

They’re all over here.

I’m not gonna touch that.

So what kind of robots are good when they’re sentient?

I think that it’s things humans cannot do.

Things that perhaps only a robot could do.

One that can think for itself would be pretty worthwhile.

So let’s start with those ones.

The ones that are good.

Number one: Chill Man.

Chill Man is a recent robot master who was built to help stop global warming.

And heaven knows we need that.

Definitely worthwhile.

Next is another cold friend: Freeze Man.

Freeze Man was built to make a non-polluting energy.

He would make that energy by splitting average temperatures

into hot temperatures and cold temperatures.

I’m choosing to think of that as something like nuclear fission as opposed to choosing

to think of it as dumb.

Commando Man.

Terrible name, but he was actually a minesweeping robot.

One of the first gens, Elec Man.

He controlled nuclear power plants.

He could help make sure the nuclear power plant was shut down in case anything bad ever

happened to one.

Hopefully it won’t!

SsssssSTAR MAN!

He was built to explore the universe.

Humans are real squishy, really, when you think about it.

It might be nice to have a man going out into the stars, a Star Man.

Also in his flavor text, he’s apparently a romantic and, like, loves poetry, and that’s

what we need out in the stars.

While he’s up there, Galaxy Man is helping figure out the trajectories.

Splash Woman!

She’s super useful because she goes and helps shipwrecked sailors, or just people

lost at sea.

I feel like she’d do a better job than, I dunno, the Coast Guard or whatever.

Not that I’m shitting on the Coast Guard.

They do do good…

I’m digging myself in a hole.

Wait, where’d Toad Man go?

*worry about Toad Man*

Where’s my guy Toad Man?

Toad Man.

He irrigates crops during drought.

Very useful.

Why’d they make him a toad?

Ice Man.

I swear we’ve got a lot of cold people up here at the front.

He’s built specifically to do human-like tasks in cold weather.

So he’s good!

More cold friends.

Blizzard Man.

There to help monitor the weather in arctic environments.

Looks and names can be deceiving, and Junk Man is super important.

Junk Man was built so he could find useable robot parts that have been left out.

Think about how much electronic waste we make.

It would be great if something could go dig through all of our trash and find the useable

circuit boards.

That’s important.

Hornet Man.

We’ve done some shit to bees y’all.

He pollinates the flowers.

Would be very useful if we continue to keep doing shit to bees.

And finally, we’ve got Cloud Man and Tornado Man.

They both are actually useful for, uh, controlling the weather when things are bad.

I’m gonna put Cloud Man in front of Tornado Man because Tornado Man, uh, was, was built

to stop tropical storms.

Which is not what a tornado is.

He needs a different name.

There we go.

These ones I would say are worth the risk.

We still have like 180 more to go.

We got a bunch of construction robots next.

We’ll start with everyone’s favorite: Guts Man.

Imagine there’s a line right here.

Maybe I’ll put it in in after effects.

That might be too much work.

I’m probably not gonna do that.

Good ones.

Now we’re into construction zone.

Guts Man comes first because he’s a civil engineer.

He’s not only strong and can lift big rocks, but he can build bridges probably.

We’ve got Aqua Man and Pump Man.

Both of them are used for water filtration.

I’m gonna put Aqua Man in front of Pump Man because Pump Man’s flavor text explains

that sometimes he’ll volunteer to wash off graffiti,

and no one likes a narc.

Bomb Man: bombs.

Ground Man: excavation.

Block Man: makes blocks.

Concrete Man: concrete.

Needle Man: needles.

I guess it’s drilling.

Drill Man: also drilling.

Bit Man, from the DOS game.

He is also a driller.

You think that after the first two went bad… they would’ve stopped making drill robots,

right?

Oil Man DOS.

He does oil… things.

Hard Man.

*trying to keep it together*

He doesn’t actually have a, um, flavor text explanation for what he is other than that

he is very heavy.

So I am assuming that he is for ground leveling.

Um.

But maybe he’s just big?

Impact Man: piling.

Cut Man: tree cutting.

Torch Man DOS: welding.

Fuse Man: electrical equipment management.

Oil Man: keeping things oiled.

Spark Man: making sparks!

I think he actually charges things.

Fire Man.

He was made to incinerate trash.

Bond Man.

He was supposed to be in the first game until they realized… he was just glue.

Stone Man.

I assume bricks, but actually they only say that he hangs out with Guts Man, so maybe

he’s just moral support.

Flame Man.

He generates thermal power.

But also he’s powered by thermal power?

Which seems recursive.

And also impossible.

Jewel Man.

He not only mines the jewels but he polishes them.

Finally, in the construction, it’s Slash Man.

He was specifically made to cut down trees so that you could build SECRET bases.

I don’t know why they insisted on saying it was for secret bases.

That seems like a waste of a robot.

To be perfectly honest, I don’t think we needed to make these ones sentient, because

you know what, Hard Man?

I think steamrollers were doing just fine.

Now we’re getting into a category I like to call…

Sure???

They’re not necessarily bad.

I just think we could probably do without Wind Man, who apparently helps with the harvest…

with fans.

Astro Man, who just works in a planetarium.

Gravity Man.

He can control gravity which could be useful?

Dive Man.

He was built to catch fish with torpedoes.

They made him look like a submarine and they gave him torpedoes.

Feel like they should’ve seen this coming.

Solar Man.

Now he investigates solar things, I guess.

He also apparently developed an exercise routine.

I don’t know why they needed to put that in the flavor text, but it definitely put

him in the “Sure???” category.

Top Man.

I’ll give ya…

I’ll give you a guess about what he does.

Did you guess “explore other planets?”

Because yeah, that’s what he was designed for.

Why the FUCK is he a top?

God these are all so good.

We’re getting into the categories where I can’t stop laugh…

*clears throat* *deep breath*

Serious.

Snake Man.

*laughter from everyone in the studio*

He, uh, was supposed to explore other planets

that had crevasses.

And he’s a snake.

Gyro Man.

He was supposed to be a really good plane, but then Wily ran out of money, so they just

stuck a propellor on his back.

Plant Man manages plants.

Pharaoh Man.

Only supposed to explore ruins.

Blast Man.

He manages fireworks.

Fireworks are dangerous.

Don’t play with fireworks.

But also, maybe, don’t make a robot to play with them.

I love Nitro Man.

I’m gonna be honest, I do feel kind of bad putting him into the “Sure???” category.

Uh, because Nitro Man was built specifically to do motorcycle stunts in movies.

The thing I really love about Nitro Man is that he’s the president of a stunt robot club.

Which I think is just wonderful.

He’s still not useful.

Here’s where thing get a little bit difficult for me.

Burst Man was built to be a guard.

I’m not sure about robot, highly armed guards.

But since he was specifically a guard…

I keep saying specifically.

I figure, like, that’s still defensive, and so…

I’ll put him here.

But it’s a good segue!

In the Mega Man games, not every robot was made by Dr. Wily or Dr. Light.

And in fact, there were some robots that were made by other robots.

Or were made extraterrestrially.

Or were made specifically as a joke, like “I can’t find my keys, man!”

I’m gonna put them kind of as the split in the middle to say, “Hey, these are nebulous,

but they’re definitely not good.”

Now that we’ve got this hard line of good to bad, even though, to be honest, I think

that the line should be here.

It’s time for us to talk about the bad robots.

J.J. Abrams.

Some of these robots were built specifically to murder.

We can all agree that that is bad.

I’m gonna put all of these murder robots over on the very bad side.

We also have a bunch of characters that are Sonic robots.

That is an affront to nature.

They’re in the bad side, too.

I also didn’t even print out all of the NetNavis from Mega Man Battle Network even

though I love those games because those were software built with the specific intention

of being mean online.

And that’s just Twitter.

I do just want to point out Aircon Man, who was a robot sent from the future to destroy

the world.

And he’s also an air conditioning unit.

Now *kick* let’s get into the fun part.

These robots have absolutely no reason to be sentient.

Chemistry Man.

He’s from the new cartoon.

He apparently taught chemistry classes that were so boring, he put kids to sleep.

And then he took it really personally, and decided to become evil.

Sheep Man.

He’s a shepard actually.

Tundra Man.

Built to do similar things to all of the high echelon frozen people, but I’m including

him over here because he got really bored at his job and then decided to become

an ice skater.

This is why you don’t make sentient robots, I guess.

Hypno Woman.

She was a therapist who hypnotized people into bad things.

DJ Jazzy J4-8950…

is a boombox.

You are a magnet.

Plug Man charged electrical things.

Like a plug could do.

Strike Man sounds cool, but he’s just a baseball throwing machine.

It’s me.

Spring Man can… jump?

Bright Man.

Built to explore dark places.

Kinda like a FLASHLIGHT.

Cold Man’s a refrigerator.

Seriously.

Sword Man.

He was developed to hold a sword that Wily stole from a place.

He’s not a sentient murder robot.

He’s a sentient picture frame.

Things that don’t really need to be sentient?

A vacuum.

It’s Dust Man.

Although, Dust Man is quoted as saying, “Don’t let me suck more than I can handle!”

So you know what, actually, I take this back.

He’s more important than Chill Man.

We’ve already done the worthwhile ones.

We’ve talked about the construction ones.

We’ve talked about the ones that are “eh whaat uh sure w-okay thas fine.”

We have all of the ones that are alien.

And we’ve got the ones that really didn’t need to be sentient.

We are left with the dregs of robotic society.

I call this category…

NO.

We’ll start with Crystal Man.

He was built to make crystals so that Dr. Wily could sell them for money.

Turbo Man is a car.

Or rather, he used to be a car, but then he was turned into turbo man.

Charge Man.

Is he a train?

No.

But he’s meant to camouflage as one.

I think Dr. Wily’s just real into trains.

You know what I think about when I think of “Safety Operations Manager?”

A big man full of magma.

Built to make sure a plant kept safe, but also had a bunch of cauldrons full of boiling

magma in him.

Time Man.

He’s a time machine.

That never goes well.

Acid Man was built to be a chemist.

What’s he good for, titrations?

That's a chemistry joke.

Centaur Man.

He... was a tour guide.

Just hire a 16 year old.

Like, they need the job.

Shark Man DOS.

Shark Man DOS not need to exist.

Oh we’ve been doing this for like five hours.

*CLAP CLAP*

Goddamnit.

Magic Man was built to be a magician in like a traveling circus sort of show.

And then he was not turned evil, he just decided to conscript in King’s army because he wanted

to show off.

Here’s the big rule of thumb:

magicians are always evil.

Shade Man.

He looks like a vampire, doesn’t he?

It’s ‘cause he was built to look like one.

He was an animatronic robot in a haunted house.

Somebody thought we should make that creepy animatronic robot sentient.

PHEW remember how Centaur Man was a tour guide?

Well so was Dynamo Man.

But they also made him constantly shoot off electricity.

That’s a bad tour guide.

When they got into, like, the late game stages, they were just like, “I dunno, he’s a

tour guide for a thing.”

Torch Man was built to teach kids about fire safety in the woods.

Which is kind of like if Smokey the Bear

was CONSTANTLY ON FIRE.

You thought torch man was bad, let me tell ya about Burner Man, who was made, and I quote,

“to bring harm to natural environments.”

Technically not murder.

Definitely bad.

Remember how I said that a lot of these guys were tour guides?

Well let me tell you about Blade Man.

Built to show off an old castle full of swords.

And also was a sword.

Tengu Man.

Makes typhoons.

HOOOKAY.

We’re at the final three here.

We’ve made it.

And I’d say that these three really hammer home the point

that we should not be making sentient robots.

We’ve got Pirate Man.

Not a murder robot.

But was built to do pirate things, like steal from other ships.

He does look cool as hell, though.

The second to last robot is not actually a terrible robot idea.

But it is a testament to just how trash human beings are.

Bounce Man was built to be a crash test dummy.

Some asshole thought, “Hey, you know that thing we throw against a wall,

many miles-per-hour,

every single day,

multiple times a day?

You know what would make that better?

IF IT COULD FEEL PAIN.”

WHAT?

Luckily, Bounce Man bounced from that job and then became an exercise instructor.

Humans are trash.

Finally, we’ve come to number one.

Clown Man.

Who has ever watched a clown and thought to themselves,

“Boy,

I wish that thing never got tired!"

Clown Man is terrible, and I’m not saying that clowns are terrible.

Okay?

Clowns serve their purpose.

They’re creepy.

Sometimes good.

And…

You know what, I do take that back, clowns don’t serve a purpose.

That’s it.

All 200+ Mega Man robot masters, of which 15 are kind of okay.

Elon Musk: don’t get any ideas.

This is what man has wrought.

You will see these men in your nightmares.

Particularly,

Spring Man.

Jumping around.

Because this… was bad. 
 2020-06-25 16:19:14,457 - DEBUG - file running:  Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.

A game that takes heroic and villainous characters and forces them to form fraternal bonds in

the crucible of battle.

Because for those who can superbly smash, there is no better place to make a friend

than on the battlefield.

That’s the battlefield?

Seriously?

How did they get permits for that?

That’s irresponsible.

Hi, I’m Brian David Gilbert, safety fan and bureaucratic wunderkind, please address

me as such, and I’ve spent the last week and a half poring over the regulations of

the United States Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration,

also known as OSHA.

I’m here to hold Super Smash Bros. to account.

Because when you take 70-plus beloved characters and force them to fight for our entertainment,

the least you can do is make sure the buildings are up to code.

So let's go ahead and FIND EVERY OSHA VIOLATION IN EVERY STAGE IN SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE.

First, let’s explain the process, we have to start by choosing the correct regulations,

and unfortunately, there isn’t a OSHA guide to “bloodsport,” so we're just gonna go

with construction, form 1926. 'Cause that's close enough.

The main thing to point out here is 1926.10 subsection A. I’ll read an excerpt for you

so you can understand the basic concept of this video, and also the hellscape I had to slog through

the past week: “no contractor or subcontractor contracting for any part of the contract work”

— that’s a real line — “shall require any laborer or mechanic employed in the performance

of the contract to work in surroundings or under working conditions which are unsanitary,

hazardous, or dangerous.”

Basically, we’re here to build a safer experience for these characters, because when you walk

into an unknown space, I want the first question on your mind to be:

There are roughly 350 regulations in form 1926.

How many pages is that?

About 684.

Don’t worry, this is... this is just a visual aid.

They're all blank.

I wouldn't waste paper like that.

*thinks of the times he's wasted paper*

Most of these regulations are irrelevant, but I

still had to read all 684 pages in order to know which ones to cut.

Which reminds me, this video idea came from commenter nshady16, so if you have an Unraveled

idea, why don't you go ahead and leave me a comment.

And thanks, nshady16, for making me read 684 pages of OSHA regulations,

you piece of garbage.

So I cut out all of the regulations that were just definitions, unrelated to stages, nonmandatory,

redundant, or about personnel safety, because again, we’re not talking about hard hats,

we're talking about the stages themselves.

Unfortunately, this also meant I had to cut out the entirety of subsection R.

Steel Erection.

So there goes like 80% of the jokes in this video.

Out of those 350 regulations, we’re left with 46 that actually relate to Smash Bros. stages.

And again, we're just using the 103 stages you get when you boot up Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.

Any any secret stages that pop up later, uh, that's probably just an underground fighting

ring, which is a different form of illegality.

I’m gonna explain all of these OSHA violations as we go along.

But I just want you to keep in mind that there is a maximum penalty of $12,934 per OSHA violation.

We’ll get into that later.

Let's get these OSHA violations on the board.

BAM!

That's all the OSHA regulations we'll be discussing today.

Let's start with the codes that pretty much every stage violates.

General safety and health provisions.

I threw these three here because they're just dangerous in general and they don't have that

many other specific violations.

Safety training and education.

Seems like most of these people don't have safety training.

Especially in Moray Towers, where they literally shoot guns at you as you fly into the stage.

Recording and reporting of injuries.

Wii Fit Studio is a gym, and so I would expect it to have paperwork if one of the gym members

gets injured.

Unfortunately, all of the gym members get injured.

Means of egress.

In most places, you have to have exit signs.

And also, you have to have exits that don't involve plummeting to your death.

Employee emergency action plans.

It's very important to have an emergency action plan.

Especially if that emergency action plan is for if a mountaintop breaks off and slides

into the ocean.

Look at this polar bear!

He has no fuckin' clue what's going on!

Accident prevention, signs, and tags.

Just put one wet floor sign anywhere, and I'll let it slide, okay?

Duty to have fall protection.

I mean uh... there's no fall protection.

How hard is it to put a harness on someone?

General requirements for stairways and ladders.

Anything above 19 inches of elevation needs a staircase or a ladder.

Not everyone can double jump.

Sanitation.

Most of sanitation deals with potable versus non-potable water.

But a lot of it also deals with toilets, and I have yet to find a Smash Bros. stage that

includes a restroom.

And I need to know where Donkey Kong pees.

So those ones pretty much everyone gets wrong.

Which means that we're at about 900 violations already.

Yikes!

I feel a bit bad hitting all of these stages so hard, so I'll be a bit lenient for 1926.50.

Medical services and first aid.

You have to provide first aid if someone has been hurt.

And I'll just let the max tomato fulfill that requirement.

451 states that you can't be using unstable objects as scaff.

I'm gonna call all of these scaff 'cause there's no OSHA guideline for levitating floors.

Jumping on an awning causes it to break in Onett.

That's totally irresponsible.

452 states that you need to have cross bracing.

Kongo Falls has so many things that aren't cross braced.

453 is all about aerial lifts.

You need to stand firmly on the ground while it is moving.

Stop jumping!

Housekeeping.

You gotta clean out the debris.

I don't care that you've got a big dog running around behind you... put the... put the blocks

away, that's debris!

Put your toys away, honey!

Occupational noise exposure.

I'm ignoring the fact that they're fighting on top of a jet and instead thinking about

how loud those jets are.

Pop some earplugs in!

Gases, vapors, fumes, dusts, and mists.

All of these stages have clouds that you can stand on.

Which means they're incredibly dense.

I don't care what it's made of, you shouldn't be breathing that in.

Illumination.

Those torches don't do anything.

I'm gonna trip and stub my toe.

Ventilation.

A lot of these stages need more airflow, better ventilation, but in Pictochat 2, there is

too much ventilation in the form of this man who blows air.

Who hired this man?

I don't want him on my job site.

Hazardous waste operations and emergency response.

In Flat Zone X, someone spills oil and then just leaves it there.

1926.150, 151, 152, and 154 are all about fire protection.

Most of these regulations are pretty self explanatory.

You need to have a fire extinguisher.

It needs to be readily available.

You can't have ignition hazards hanging around.

You can't store more than 25 gallons of a flammable liquid in one place.

By the way, I'm including magma as a flammable liquid.

I know they mean petroleum substances, but I think that's just a lack of imagination

on OSHA's part.

But 154 is all about temporary heating devices and how they shouldn't be kept in enclosed spaces.

Kind of like the charmander at the top of Saffron City.

The general requirements of electrical equipment.

They should be kept free from hazards that could cause death or harm to employees.

The large airships flying around you in these stages are not only electrical equipment,

but they are designed to harm and kill you.

Violation.

Specific purpose equipment and installations.

This is all about elevators and escalators.

WarioWare Inc. is one big elevator.

You don't need me to tell you it's broken.

Helicopters.

Is a Shy Guy a helicopter?

I think so.

You're not supposed to be working underneath hovering craft.

Even if they're bringing you fruit.

Conveyors.

That includes the stages that move back and forth and also all of the scrolling stages,

which are the fastest way to die in Super Smash Bros. Tools and material shall be secured

to prevent movement.

Don't move equipment unless it's safe.

They're on a live racetrack.

All of the things are moving.

Marine operations and equipment.

You have to have a lifering on a barge, and you have to provide a walkway between wharfs

and boats.

Paper Mario dissolves into a boat, but that doesn't count as a walkway.

And there is not a single lifering at the Donkey Kong residence.

I don't care how good you are at surfing, FUNKY KONG.

Underground construction.

If you're working underground, you're required to have a five-person rescue team on call.

And although Super Smash Bros.

Ultimate does allow up to eight players.

None of them will save you.

Working on or near exposed energized parts.

Does a pokemon count as an energized circuit?

According to OSHA, yes.

1926.1052 is all about stairways.

If you have a stairway that rises more than 40 inches, you need to have a handrail.

I imagine that Mario is about 40 inches tall, and this is at least four or five times his height.

Violation.

Violation.

VIOLATION.

VIOLATION!

Confined spaces.

These are places where you are building where it's hard to get in and out of.

You need to specify the acceptable entry conditions.

There are no acceptable entry conditions into a space with a pit full of acid.

Disposal of waste materials.

If you are dropping waste materials more than 25 feet, you need to be putting it in a chute.

Clock Tower: it is all debris that is falling infinitely.

And it SHOULD be in a chute.

850 is about preparing the demolition building.

You're supposed to remove any glass that could break.

And in Dracula's Castle, Death flies through the window and breaks the glass.

I couldn't give a shit about Death, you should've removed that stained glass first.

853, you can't have a aggregate of more than 25% of a floor destroyed, and in Find Mii,

he destroys half of the stage.

The manual removal of floors.

You can destroy a lot of things in Shadow Moses Island, but you shouldn't be standing

under them.

Tower cranes.

There is only one stage that violates this.

It's literally the only stage with a tower crane, and ya FUCKED IT UP!

Explosives should be stored in a magazine when they're not in use.

And in Wrecking Crew, they're just available for you to punch until they explode.

Firing the blast.

You shouldn't be in the proximity of the blast.

Nor should you be in the barrel that is causing the blast and shooting you off into space.

1926.53 and 54 are about different types of radiation.

Ionizing, which is nuclear, and non-ionizing, which is like lasers.

Final Destination is just flying around through random parts of space.

There is no protection.

You should be less worried about getting punched into oblivion and more worried about the cancers.

In Gamer, your mom fires lasers at you when she sees you gaming.

I'm not here to discuss her qualifications, but you are not allowed to fire those lasers

at employees.

JUST LET ME GAME, MOM!

Ladders.

Suzaku Castle?

You thought you could get away with that shitty-ass ladder?

Those ladder rungs need to be uniform.

They need to be evenly spaced.

They need to not be broken.

I know that ladder is there for aesthetic purposes, but THAT IS A VIOLATION, SUZAKU

CASTLE.

YOU CANNOT HIDE YOUR LADDERS FROM ME.

That leaves us with one stage.

The one that has violated the most regulations.

But I want to point out Boxing Ring.

The only stage that is OSHA compliant.

It's almost as if it was built to allow people to fight in it safely.

Sakurai, I know you worked so hard on this game, and I appreciate it so much, but you

could have stopped at just one stage.

You SHOULD have STOPPED at JUST ONE STAGE.

Finally, weighing in at 23 OSHA violations, it's 75m.

I'm not 100% sure if this had so many violations just because it is a construction site, so

it was easier for me to find all of the flaws with it.

Obviously, Brinstar is probably more dangerous, but I don't know how to categorize Mother Brain.

The thing that pushed it over the edge was material hoists, personnel hoists, and elevators.

They need to be enclosed at all times.

People can just jump on and off of these material hoists over there.

That's so irresponsible.

There's fire.

There are jacks that get thrown across the stage.

There is a large ape.

Again, I could not categorize that, but I know he shouldn't of been there! 75m is the

most OSHA violating stage in Smash Bros.

And if you have to get rid of one of them, that's the one you should get rid of first,

and then you should get rid of the rest of them, too.

Because, again, OSHA does not stop after one stage.

Let's remember back to the beginning of this video when I talked about violation penalties.

I mentioned that every serious violation of OSHA is $12,934 in fines.

I forgot to mention that every repeated or willful violation is $129,336 per violation.

I am going to pretend that I found all of these violations on the same day, and that

they didn't have a chance to fix them all, so therefore they are not repeated.

But that's still 1,317 violations.

Or $17,034,078 in fines.

Which is why I am sending you this video, Masahiro Sakurai.

Surely you can't afford 17 million dollars in fines.

I'm willing to let bygones be bygones.

OSHA doesn't need to hear about all of this evidence I've compiled.

All you must do is send me 50 US dollars.

I'm in a real tough situation right now and I just need to get through the month.

Please.

Also you could send me Kirby's phone number.

I know he is real.

Where are you hiding him?

And I have yet to see a Super Smash Bros. stage that includes a toilet.

And I need to see where Donkey Kong pees.

*Pat & Brian laughing* And I need to know where Donkey Kong Pees.

Oh god I was so close!

And I need to know where Donkey Kong peeHHSHSS.

*through laughter* sorry this is... *breathe in* AHHHH 
 2020-06-25 16:19:14,458 - DEBUG - file running:  *cheerful music, slowly diminishing*

Is life quantifiable?

Every breath, every beat of a heart...

Do they count as tallies etched tirelessly into the stone of our existence,

until one day, that stone is returned to dust?

Is there a number, an algorithm, underlying the spark of life?

And if given the chance to know the arcane secrets of that algorithm,

would you use that power for good?

Or would you use it to calculate your pet’s HP?

Because that’s what I would do!

*energetic music*

HIT POINTS!

What are they and how did they become the standard unit of life in nearly every game?

It all started with war games, tabletop games that involve a lot of little miniature military

forces fighting on a battlefield.

Back in the 1920s, the Naval War College created an early form of this in order to help evaluate

battles before actually fighting them.

They had a stat called “Life” which was determined by how many

14-inch shell hits a vessel could take.

So that’s what a hit point is, how many 14-inch shells it would take to kill you.

Every living creature is one hit point.

The end.

But that isn’t our current understanding of HP.

That came when war games shrank in scope and started to become more fantasy oriented.

In older games, you would roll dice, and then your troops would either survive or they would die.

You had large swaths of nameless troops so you could do this without feeling any remorse

over their deaths.

Haha.

War.

But when these games stopped playing with hundreds of troops and instead focused on

a few main characters, players realized they didn’t want their characters to die!

So the hit point was born.

Your character could survive X number of bad rolls before throwing them in the garbage.

So really, the hit point wasn’t made to quantify how easy something is to kill,

it was born from compassion and wanting to see your characters grow and thrive.

And then also to figure out how easy they were to kill.

We’ve had some semblance of HP for nearly a century, but we haven’t updated our real-world

understanding of what one hit point looks like.

So I’ll be doing that, specifically so you can quantify your pet’s HP.

A little disclaimer up front:

I am not giving you this algorithm so you can battle your pets.

Animal abuse is wrong.

And if you needed me to tell you that...

I’m glad I told you that.

I'm also not teaching you how to calculate human HP, because that power is too great to wield,

and it could easily be used for evil by some of the most wicked forces on Earth...

like health insurance companies.

No, I am teaching you how to calculate your pet’s HP as a fun bonding exercise between

you and your animal, or in case you happen to be at a house party where you don’t know

anyone but the hosts have a dog and so instead of just sitting in the corner pretending to

text people, you can spend your time calculating that dog's HP, which is a way more normal

thing to do in a social situation.

Now it is time for the research.

How are we going to effectively calculate ANY pet’s HP?

Luckily, there are plenty of games that cover pretty much every type of pet that you could

possibly have, but I’ll be using Pokemon as the main pet HP analog because it is literally

about having lots and lots of pets that you can love and cherish

and I’m ignoring all the other stuff.

And that brings us to our first criteria: Type.

According to the National Pet Owners Survey, here are the most common types of pets found

in U.S. Households.

I appreciate that they have included a category called “Small Animals,”

as if that means fucking anything.

So we're changing some things.

The standards are still there: Dog, Cat, Fish (and all aquatic creatures), Reptile, Bird,

Equine, Small animal is becoming small mammal for things like ferrets and rabbits.

We're also including bug, because I love bugs!

And if you have bugs in your house and you make the conscious decision to WANT those bugs in your house,

they aren't pests,

they're pets...s.

Amphibian for the frog people.

Farm animals covers any livestock that don’t immediately fit into the other categories.

Originally, I thought about classifying these quadrupedal animals as different sorts of dog.

Chunky dog, milky dog, horny dog.

But farm animal encompasses them a little bit better.

I am still keeping those names, though.

We also have a category I call “exotic,” which encompasses all of the animals you see

in instagram influencer pics that make you say,

This can go from monkeys to bats to hyenas, which, according to this incredibly reliable

website, I could technically own in New York due to a loophole?

*about to make a terrible decision*

Also, Millennials and Gen Z often live in tiny, “no pet” apartments and

don’t get paid enough to support a decent standard of living for themselves, let alone

a pet, so they’ll often turn to plants in order to feel the joy that comes from nurturing

a living thing in our rapidly decaying ecosystem.

*sigh*

So I’m extending pet status to plants so that way you too can do this HP calculation,

because, god, we all need a distraction sometimes.

By building a set of pet types, we are able to assign HP RANGES to each of them by finding

the lowest base HP and highest max HP of each type.

The absolute extremes of this scale are Shedinja, with a base HP of 1, and Wailord, with a max HP of 544.

Now, both of these would be pretty wild to have as pets,

considering one is the shell left behind after a cicada molts,

and the other is a fucking whale.

But that’s why they’re the extremes, and that’s why we are not done with our equation yet.

We might know the full HP range of a dog, but what is the HP range of YOUR dog.

I thought for a moment about having size be the next criteria, because you might think

that the larger the animal, the more HP it would have.

But that’s actually not true!

In fact, the Pokemon with the highest base HP is Blissey, this strange little egg woman.

And Onix, an enormous rock snake, has one of the lowest base HPs of all Pokemon.

This confused me, so I had to go back to the original popularizer of HP: Dungeons & Dragons.

And it was there that I realized what truly affects your HP value:

Your value is not defined by the size or shape of your body,

it’s about what you do with the body you’re given.

*cheesy motivational music*

It’s all about class!

As in, what standard gaming class does your pet fall into?

Every class has different HP ranges based on what they are expected to do.

Barbarians are out in the front lines, so they tend to have a lot more HP than a rogue,

who is slinking around in the back.

I’ve decided that the classes that make the most sense for pets are: Barbarian, Ranger,

Paladin, Cleric, and Rogue.

I haven’t included any classes like sorcerer, because if you have a magical pet,

what are you doing here?

Go cast spells with your turtle.

These class distinctions separate your pet’s HP range into 10 equal portions.

If your pet is a rogue, you get the first six.

If your pet is a barbarian, you're anywhere from five to 10.

Your pet’s personality will determine what class they fall into.

Your pet is a rogue if they are rakish, mischievous, and spry.

Cats tend to come to mind for the rogue category, simply because they’re always up in shit

they should not be up in.

Your pet is a cleric if they are kind, reserved, and healing.

A rabbit that hops onto your lap after a rough day of work and makes you forget all your

worries is 100% cleric.

Your pet is a paladin if it is loyal, resourceful, and, honestly, tries a little bit too hard.

Does your zucchini plant produce too many zucchinis?

A.K.A.

Any amount of zucchinis?

It's a paladin.

Your pet is a ranger if they are self-sufficient, aloof, and kind of do their own thing.

Ask yourself, am I holding my pet rat back from their true ambitions?

The answer is always yes, and your rat is a ranger.

And finally your pet is a barbarian if they are boorish, brazen, and courageous to a fault.

Does your dog dig under the fence so it can jump into your neighbor’s pool?

Your dog is Marmaduke.

It is also a Barbarian.

Your pet can have a combination of many of these traits, but it’s up to you to decide

which traits are most dominant.

Now that we have your pet’s type and class designated, we need to get into the nitty

gritty of their exact HP, which means finding your pet's level.

In order to do this, you must observe your pet in a scientific manner.

So I reached out to field biologist.

Hi, I’m Olivia.

I'm a wildlife biologist.

I contacted Olivia after she responded to my totally normal twitter request with this

dope-ass picture.

I figured that if anyone knew how to calculate the hit points of an animal, it would be someone

holding a huge bird like it was a torch.

Have you ever found the hit points of any of the animals you've been researching?

I've never been involved in any sort of study where that was something that we looked at.

So no.

Okay.

But there are probably plenty of studies about hit points with animals.

Probably.

Though she didn’t have experience with my specific question, I knew she would have some

useful advice for observing animals in their natural habitat.

When you're observing an animal, how much interaction should you have with it?

None.

None.

At all.

None.

You have to sit in like a blind or a tent of some sort where you're hidden or you look

like part of the environment.

You could wear a ghillie suit.

Brian - Oh!

Olivia - People have also done that.

How long of a period are you observing that animal for?

It depends on how much time and resources you have, obviously.

There have been scientists that have been observing the same hawk for, like, 20 years in a row.

So if I'm trying to... perfectly know my pet's HP, I should be observing it for

multiple years.

Yes.

Cool.

How do you take notes when you're observing an animal.

Right, so, I actually—can I send you something?

Yes, please.

This is exactly what I was looking for.

Olivia had sent me an animal behavior data sheet, which I could use as a template for

observing and recording a pet’s behavior.

But some of these behaviors wouldn’t make sense when observing your pet on a random day.

We ended up developing a new sheet that had standard behaviors and class specific behaviors

that had different weights associated with them.

You observe your pet for X number of hours, tally up all the behaviors they did over the

course of those hours, and then divide the weighted total by X to give you your pet’s level.

The logic behind this is that a higher level pet is more likely to do more intense and

class specific behaviors.

Then you plug that level into this algorithm, and you get your pet’s HP.

It may seem challenging, but science shouldn’t be easy, it should be correct.

This is probably the hardest scientific work you've ever had to do.

It really is.

Yeah.

With these tips in mind, I welcome you into my home.

In order to test these calculations, I need a test subject.

So I’m using my roommate’s cat, Zuko!

He lives in my apartment but he doesn’t pay rent and he eats my bagels if I leave

them unattended.

As I mentioned previously, finding your pet's HP can be a fun bonding exercise, and in this

case, I’ve been dealing with this small bastard’s antics for so long, I need to

remind myself why he’s here by quantifying his value.

The first step is easy!

He is a cat.

That puts him in the cat category.

Okay.

Step two, we gotta give Zuko a class.

As I mentioned previously, cats are often rogues, but I don't think that fits Zuko considering

he’s the least stealthy creature I know.

His meow sounds like he’s been smoking two packs a day for the past forty years.

*incredibly raspy meow*

And every time he does manage to sneak into his food cabinet,

he lets me know immediately.

Just wanted to check in on what's going on up here in the cat cabinet where we keep all

of the food for the cat.

*loud crash*

He is loud, stubborn, and not afraid to make terrible decisions in plain

view of me.

And that makes this guy a Barbarian.

Okay!

But now it is time to observe Zuko to find his level.

As per Olivia’s instructions, I must observe him for several years without any interaction.

After explaining why I needed it, my time off request was denied.

So instead, I ate some bodega sushi in order to induce illness, and I took a sick day.

Mmmm.

This is the hard part, because it's going to require me to observe Zuko as he goes about

his daily business without him noticing that I am here at all.

I assumed my position, and I waited for the interesting behaviors to start.

*cheeky music plays*

Not only was this terribly boring, but I was beginning to fear that Zuko

was not as strong as I had hoped.

DO SOMETHING!

PLEASE!

But then I realized there was a exploit in my system.

Though Olivia, a scientist, said that you should keep your interferences to a minimum...

I’m not a scientist, I’m a gamer.

And I began what is known as power leveling.

I had to get Zuko as many experience points as I could before my roommate got home and

asked me what I was doing.

Over the course of the day, Zuko averaged 63 behavioral experience points per hour,

although those behaviors were somewhat coerced by me.

I know that I broke my system by interacting with Zuko, but if it makes my pet happier

and it makes him less of a weak-ass scrub, why wouldn’t I game the system!

I had also noticed that Zuko and I had grown closer, our support level had increased to

at least a B. I no longer saw him as a freeloader who sometimes throws up in my bed,

I saw him as a companion...

who sometimes throws up in my bed.

When I felt lonely in my empty apartment, he was there for me.

When my stomach ached from the bodega sushi, he purred at just the right frequency to ease my pain.

When I was worried he was going to be under leveled, he soothed my anxieties

with his heavenly voice.

*beautiful meow*

And all this time I had spent trying to calculate his HP,

I hadn't realized he was replenishing mine.

So here is Zuko, Barbarian class level 63.

I love him with all my heart, and he loves me just the same.

Ow!

Okay, okay...

*lots of wonderful meows*

Beautiful.

Psst!

Remember when I said I really wanted to play the Cyberpunk RPG?

We finally did it.

Come watch me play as a totally uncool forum moderator called Vang0Bang0.

Guys don't say other things, we should only have one person in the...

You're making it sound like there are more than one person in...

There's only one person in the bathroom!

THE SIMS! While other games push you through the meticulously crafted story

of some hero, this game allows you to experience the joy that comes from crafting your friends and family

and then making them pee themselves in doorless rooms.

I’ve been playing The Sims since I was a kid, and it allowed me to imagine what I might become.

A successful doctor, perhaps, with a mansion

and a pool that doesn’t have a ladder to get out of it.

And now that I’m a D-list internet video producer with a grungy apartment in New York City,

I’ve realized that I was using The Sims as wish fulfillment.

Perhaps there’s a better way.

I might only have one life, but my Sim can live many, many lives.

I was playing a game.

I should have been doing an experiment.

So today, I’m going to use The Sims to perfect my living situation.

*music stops*

Oh what a surprise!

Now, this Unraveled will be a little bit different

considering most of it is going to be game footage, meaning...

I don’t need any paper!

Let me explain my methodology. We will have two subjects:

Simulated Brian, and reality Brian, which is me, I’m Reality Brian.

Here’s my hypothesis: If Simulated Brian’s living situation can be perfected in the Sims,

then Reality Brian’s living situation can also be perfected by altering it the same way in real life.

Now, I could try to do this in a “perfectly controlled environment,” but life is messy and sometimes

science has to be messy, too. So before I can create my Sim...

I gotta measure my apartment.

Obviously, I have to work with what I currently have. And if I’m supposed to make an honest

simulacrum of my living situation I gotta make sure it’s to scale.

I should also point out that I live in a three bedroom apartment with two roommates and a cat. And although

they have rooms of their own, I will not be modeling them in the Sims.

Partially because I rarely spend any time in their rooms, but it’s more because I am a good roommate

who respects personal boundaries. I will not redecorate their personal spaces.

But I will exploit the common space for content.

When you cut my roommates rooms, you can split my apartment into 6 different sections.

I used vanilla Sims 4, because I didn’t want Simulated Brian to accidentally become a wizard, or a skeleton,

or a college student.

The first step is to make an accurate depiction of myself, both in personality and in appearance.

This took a good chunk of time, but it was worth it when I crafted an exact 1 to 1 replica

of myself in the Sims. Then, I built the space. I used my measurements and gave myself close

to unlimited funds to create the apartment, and bought myself the cheapest appliances

just like my landlord did.

At the end of this, I had a pretty exact reproduction.

Then it was test time.

I gave myself a career similar to my own, and then I let Simulated Brian do his thing.

My rule was that I had to have little to no interaction.

But after a few days, it became clear that there were flaws with my experiment.

One, it was too slow.

If I want a longitudinal look at Simulated Brian’s living situation, I need to see his ENTIRE life.

Two, this experiment is meant to perfect my living situation, not my job.

And currently, Sim Brian is finding enough fulfillment in his career, which is an uncontrolled space.

Sim Brian needs to stay in his apartment, and that means no job.

Three, Sim Brian was perfectly content reading books,

and everyone knows that books are BORING!

So I obviously need to fix whatever personality flaw turned my Sim into a dweeb.

I addressed the first flaw by downloading a mod that would allow me to put on Ultra Fast Speed.

I also altered my sim's personality to reflect my own… and I accepted that Simulated Brian’s appearance

wasn’t all that accurate in the first trial, so I fixed that as well.

With the new personality traits and the ultra fast speed mod, this trial was far more accurate.

I spent a lot of time standing in my bathroom, staring at the wall, or sadly contemplating my reflection.

And then Sim Brian died of starvation after 4 days.

Which is a MASSIVE SUCCESS!

I got to see the entirety of my Sim's life!

In trial 3, I took a hands-off approach.

I popped on ultra fast speed, and I let it ride.

In this trial, I die of starvation after just 2 and a half days.

Which makes me think that this mod might be so fast that Sim Brian can’t feed himself.

So in trial 4, I start on normal fast speed,

and I decide I’ll only jump to lightspeed when I’m bored.

And things start well enough!

Sim Brian manages to socialize and stay happy for two days.

It starts to break down on Tuesday, when I find my sim

sadly eating a grilled cheese in his empty kitchen.

And then on Wednesday, Sim Brian sadly eats cereal while staring out the kitchen window.

Things get real bad at 2 am on Thursday,

when he stares in the mirror for hours.

The ennui has set in.

That afternoon, he stands in front of some dirty dishes on the coffee table,

too depressed to wash them in the sink, which is mere feet away.

Sim Brian goes through the same motions for the next week.

Watching TV. Staring in the mirror. Sleeping at random intervals. He seems devastatingly unhappy.

But he manages to live a much fuller life than the past two iterations!

It takes him nearly a week longer to die of starvation!

Except, he doesn’t really die.

In an effort to expedite the death sequence, I accidentally hit ultra fast speed,

and for some reason,

this killed death.

I waited, hoping the reaper would respawn, but no.

So I rushed through the days.

Waiting for someone to find my collapsed body in the weird corner of my creepy hallway,

but the only people who noticed my quote unquote "death"

were the utility companies.

I used this moment to look around my neighborhood.

Most houses were far nicer.

I was alone in a little box surrounded by neighbors who had forgotten me, or perhaps never knew I existed.

Even death had forgotten me.

I watched my slumped body linger in limbo as nothing changed.

After a week, I resigned myself to quitting.

And then in trial 5 I peed myself!

A LOT!

Boy, trial 5 exemplifies how much my apartment needs an upgrade.

At the beginning of the trial, my sim left the house to socialize.

And he was so happy not being in his tiny apartment that he stayed outside for 12 hours,

ignoring his bodily functions, and at 9pm, while speaking to a potential new friend,

he peed himself.

Does this make the embarrassed and uncomfortable Sim go inside?

NO.

Sim Brian so loathes his living space that he decides to stand outside all night browsing the internet,

until again, he pees himself right before having a flirty conversation with his friend Terri.

Dirty, dirty Terri.

After another full day outside,

hunger, exhaustion, and the need to pee FINALLY make Sim Brian go home.

He was more willing to spend two nights soaked in piss before spending a single minute inside his apartment.

Big Mood.

The rest of his life was typical. Mirror. Standing. Dying of starvation.

After 5 control trials, it was time for the results.

Here’s what I learned:

One, I’d rather spend time outside my house in repulsive conditions than spend time inside my house.

Something needs to change.

Two, the only thing that ever managed to make Sim Brian happy

was “good decoration.”

I need to redecorate.

And three, Sim Brian managed his basic needs until he became desolate due to a lack of social interaction.

A hole so deep he couldn’t go anywhere but down.

And this makes me believe that the thing that killed me was not starvation,

but rather becoming so lonely that I no longer sought to fix my situation.

But that has nothing to do with my apartment,

so let’s focus on the things we can change!

Simulated Brian was happiest in these terrible trials when the decorations were good,

and that’s something I can fix in real life.

But before I do, let’s set some ground rules:

One, I can't alter any of the rooms in my apartment, or I'd lose my security deposit.

Two, I can't change the furniture, because my roommates bought it, and then they’d hate me.

And three, the money. I had considered giving my sim a budget similar to my own,

but money cannot buy happiness.

And if this is true, then money, when compared to happiness, has no correlation.

Therefore, money is no object, and my sim should be allowed to purchase anything regardless of price.

Infinite money.

Sims decorations show how many environmental points they are worth.

By this logic, it doesn’t matter how well a room is decorated…

it matters how MUCH a room is decorated.

So I spent a solid hour giving my apartment the most decorations possible.

Allow me to give you a first person tour.

The Living Room now has lots of beautiful paintings.

The Weird Nook now has a purpose as The JAZZ Room, because for some reason,

the Sims has SO MANY JAZZ PAINTINGS.

The TV has to stay, but now I have three maps around it to say, “I’m also smart sometimes.”

The Kitchen hasn’t changed because it’s small and there’s no space to hang anything.

The creepiness of the hallway has crystallized into Sad Clowns.

No one wanted to spend much time in this hallway before,

and now they REALLY don’t want to.

In my room, a bunch of portraits, an apple wall, and a pear wall.

This should remind my sim to eat food.

And finally, in the bathroom, I installed a second mirror so I can’t just stare at the wall.

Now let’s see it in action.

In the first trial, I did another hands off approach on ultra fast speed,

and my sim once again died of starvation super quickly.

So, yeah, maybe the mod is too strong.

BUT! In trial 2, things go way better.

For the first time in any of the trials,

my sim manages to go from Very Sad to Happy, thanks to the tasteful decorations!

Though Sim Brian has moments of ennui and loneliness, for the most part, the house is making him happier.

Sim Brian does so well that he survives after the utilities shut off his power and water,

and he dies of starvation after more than two weeks.

That’s nearly DOUBLE the length of any of the other trials!

MY DECORATIONS WORKED!

Yeah, I still die of starvation, but I’m living TWICE AS LONG!

And that’s all the proof I need that this is the perfect form of my apartment.

All I gotta do now is make it in real life.

Polygon said that they wouldn’t reimburse me for purchasing thousands of dollars worth of paintings,

even though I TOLD them it would make me more productive,

so I gave myself a budget.

Then I went to a lot of thrift stores to purchase

as many paintings as I could find.

Some fit the aesthetic. Others would need alterations.

But I got a lot of things! Or, I thought I had, until I got home and realized

it wasn’t even going to cover one of my walls, let alone all six rooms.

So I dug around my apartment to find anything that could be stuck on the walls.

In the end, I was able to fill the entrance, but the rest of the living room was pretty sparse.

In the Jazz room I put up a papier mache man playing the piano, a dart board that felt pretty jazz to me,

and a skeleton wearing a tank top that says "I heart my Daddy,"

because...

I honestly didn’t know where else I could put that.

In my own room, I put up the appletini painting and

hung a huge self portrait from my senior year of high school.

And that was it.

That’s all I had in terms of decorations.

I took the day off to do this, but I was done in an hour.

I even put on my suit in order to film the results of the trial,

but my house felt as empty as it had when I began.

I couldn’t start the live experiment because I couldn’t recreate my sim’s house.

But I wasn’t giving up.

If I couldn’t purchase the decorations I needed, I figured I could make them myself.

So I bought a bunch of washable paint and 1000 feet of butcher paper.

“I don't need any paper!”

I lied.

It was a week before Thanksgiving. I was going to be out of town

and I needed to finish this part of the video before I left.

That meant I had to create about 70 large paintings in less than three days.

I got a solid start, painting all of the apples and pears.

I even managed to edit the two paintings I got from the thrift store into Sad Clowns.

But I was halfway through the second Sad Clown when this process started weighing on me.

If I had to spend a few hours on 10 of the simplest paintings,

there was no way I was gonna get this finished before deadline.

I was alone in an apartment making shitty paintings for a video that wasn’t gonna get made in time.

I got a stress migraine, so I turned off the camera, and I went to lie down.

When I woke up from that heinous nap,

I decided to do one of the most difficult things I’ve had to do for an Unraveled:

I asked for help.

And if you’ve never had to ask your friends and coworkers

to help you paint terrible paintings for a stupid video,

let me say you’re not missing out on much.

It’s an uncomfortable thing to ask people to do.

And honestly, the weirdest part of this whole process is that...

people said yes.

People said they'd come help me paint.

And, and they said yes just because they wanted to,

and also 'cause I said I’d buy pizza,

but you gotta grease the wheels somehow.

So I turned my house into a painting factory. I cut the paper. I moved the furniture.

And that night, people came over. Not just my roommate and my coworkers but my friends,

and friends of those friends.

I was expecting one or two people to help me, but I ended up with 10 people in my house,

all painting large scale portraits

and REALLY GOOD SAD CLOWNS.

Seriously, who knew that my friends were SO GOOD at painting sad clowns?

I don’t 100% know how to feel about how good my friends are at painting sad clowns,

but I'm glad I gave 'em an outlet.

All of these people came over just to make my apartment happier.

To lend a hand when I was overwhelmed.

And not only were they helping me make my apartment happier by decorating it,

they made it happier just by being there.

This task that had given me a stress migraine became a really fun time.

And it reminded me that, although it can sometimes feel uncomfortable or embarrassing,

if you ask for help, more often than not,

people are willing to help

you paint large pictures of jazz men.

In three hours, a task that seemed insurmountable by myself was complete.

And I was so excited that I did the walkthrough while they were all still there.

The Living room with fabulous landscapes,

The Jazz room’s huge murals.

The Creepy clown hallway that was way too good.

My room with its amazing portraits and fruit walls.

And the bathroom, where I stared at myself,

not considering my flaws or my apartment, but just smiling.

That’s it.

Just smiling.

It’s been well over two weeks since my apartment was redecorated,

which is longer than I survived in the Sims trials,

so it’s been an incredible success.

My apartment is perfected, I’m happier with it, and it’s all thanks to the redecoration.

Or at least, that’s part of it.

I think that part of the reason I find so much joy in my apartment is knowing

that the decorations were made by people I care about.

There’s a story behind it.

Simulated Brian fell further into sadness due to his isolation,

but the paint night turned Reality Brian’s terrible situation into something joyous.

So I have to wonder:

Does my newly perfected apartment make me happier because of the decorations,

or because of the people who helped me decorate it?

Trick question, it’s obviously the decorations.

JESUS! 
 2020-06-25 16:19:14,459 - DEBUG - file running:  Ah, the Elder Scrolls, games chock-full of lore.

And Skyrim is no different.

Hidden amongst the draugr and dragons is a plethora of books full of very important

and incredibly niche details.

But with all the spellcasting and shouting you must do as dragonborn, who really has

the time to read all those books.

I DO.

APPARENTLY.

I read every book in Skyrim in order to answer the eternal question, “Should you read every

book in Skyrim?”

And I’m here to give you my top five recommendations of books, here in my SKYRIM BOOK REPORT.

Skyrim book report!

How many books are there, really, in Skyrim?

After all, there are only eight people credited as writers on Skyrim.

Those eight people are responsible for every quest, every voice acting line, every response

you can give to an NPC.

How much time do they have to write all those other books?

A lot!

Because they wrote this many books.

This many books.

*pained grin*

Or at least they wrote most of them because a few of them have been grandfathered in from

other Elder Scrolls games.

Before I get into the nitty gritty, let me explain my process on how I did this Skyrim

Book Report.

I printed out every book in Skryim, and then I spent multiple eight-hour days reading EVERY.

SINGLE.

BOOK.

I whittled it down to 338 books because I didn’t include journals or diaries.

Everyone knows that self-published doesn’t count.

In total, that’s 571 pages, five and a half point font, over three hundred and sixteen

THOUSAND words.

I had two reactions to this.

My first reaction was, “Wow.”

This is an incredible amount of world building.

To write 300,000 words that could essentially be skipped over while still having the full

Skyrim experience, it’s amazing, and it’s a level of world building that could only

exist in an interactive medium.

And for that, I commend you, Bethesda.

My second reaction to this,

was WHAT THE FUCK.

HEY TODD?

WHAT THE FU-

In my Skyrim Book Report, I will be discussing:

*smack*

That’s a smash cut.

Hopefully.

If I do my editing correctly.

338 books.

Uh, actually, 337, I just realized, um, over here, Songs of Skyrim, I put both of them

in there, but there’s a revised edition.

I lied.

It’s just 337 books now.

Obviously, I don’t have time to synopsize all of these, and believe me, you wouldn’t

want to watch that even if I could.

I’ve split them into categories to make this a little bit easier.

First up, historical books!

These book titles you see rolling up the screen are all biographies or histories.

What I categorized as histories was anything that had big historical dates in them, explanatory

histories, or pretty much anything that was boring.

History’s so BORING.

UGHHHH.

J.R.R. Tolkien

*kiss*

did the world a disservice by making every single fantasy writer think

that they need to chronicle every goddamn minute of their world in order for it to be

legitimate.

I don’t give two shits about a king who lost a war 700 years ago.

*snoring noises* Get OUTTA here!

Some of these biographies are actually pretty interesting.

But a lot of them are written like The Chronicles of Nchuleft.

I didn’t tab it out ‘cause it’s a shitty story.

“It happened in Second Planting (P.D. 1220) that Lord Ihlendam, on a journey in the Western

Uplands, came to Nchuleft; and Protector Anchard and General Rkungthunch met him there, and

Dalen-Zanchu also came to the meeting.

They talked together long by themselves; but this only was known of their business, that

they were to be friends of each other.

They parted, and each went home to his own colony.”

RIVETING.

Ugh.

History’s so boring.

I’m done with this.

Next category: Instructional books!

These are all field guides or basic recipes about how to make good armor or what flowers

go in which potions.

At best, they are in-fiction instructional books.

At worst, they are so obviously trying to get you to go do specific things.

Pulls you right out of the fiction!

C’mon man.

That’s all I’m gonna say about that.

Everyone’s favorite: the academic books.

Fun fact about academic books that I learned in college

is that no one has ever enjoyed writing or reading an academic paper.

WHY’D YOU PUT IT IN A VIDEO GAME.

Mythicaaaaal stories.

It’s kind of weird to differentiate things between myth and history, especially in this

world where you can talk to demon princes.

I split these two up because these are very boring and these are slightly more palatable.

They’re more like creation myths, or they’re just like random stories that are fun to read,

so they’re getting closer to good fiction.

The poetic and dramatic.

Everyone knows that poetry and theatre are meant to be seen and not read.

And you have NO IDEA how much it pains me that I do not have time to do staged readings

of all these.

Oh my GOD I would have loved that.

We have “eh.”

What genre is “eh?”

It’s the catchall.

Um, these tend to be accounts, kind of like medieval fantasy op-eds.

So I…

I just put ‘em here.

EH!

We’re done with these now, so…

Get outta here!

Finally, we have 59 books that I would consider good fiction.

GooooOOOD fiction.

What I did here is I gave myself three criteria about what would make good fiction in the

realm of Skyrim.

Number one, does it help build the world around us?

Number two, does it give us an interesting or different perspective on that world?

And number three, is it good?

Now you might say, “Brian, what gives you the right to say what is good fiction?”

I READ ALL 338 YA DINGUS.

BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY THAT THESE WERE THE ONLY GOOD ONES.

THIS IS ALL I’M QUALIFIED TO DO NOW.

I need a drink.

*deep breath*

Okay!

There’s still 59 of these, so I obviously can’t summarize all of them, but I have

left five off, and they are my top five books of Skyrim.

So we’re gonna talk about those.

Number five, Advances in Lockpicking.

Now Advances in Lockpicking is actually an instructional book.

But I think it does more than just the other instructional books, where you open them up

and suddenly you’re better at lockpicking, because it’s written by a thief in a very

interesting voice.

There’s a great ending line for this book: “Some thieves can’t read.

If you can’t read, get someone to read this book to you.

It will make more sense then.”

That’s great.

I think that’s a much more fun way than saying, “Here is how you pick a lock.

This is what this set of armor is.”

Better than instructional.

Just good fiction.

Number four, Palla.

In a world where crazy creatures exist, how do you make fiction that is compelling that

people can just kind of experience in their own life.

Palla is a necromantic romantic book.

It’s a story about a man who sees this beautiful statue of a woman fighting a beast and falls

instantly in love with this woman.

Turns out, she’s dead!

From fighting that beast.

He decides to get into necromancy to bring her back from the dead.

I kind of don’t want to ruin the surprise for you.

It manages to tell an interesting story while also introducing these ideas of monsters and

necromancy.

It’s kind of weird, but it’s very well written.

I’m gonna go ahead and put up three and two.

Why do I put up the Argonian Account and Feyfolken at the same time?

Turns out, it’s written by the same fictional author: WAUGHIN JARTH.

This one’s for you, Waughin!

I’m a big Jarth head!

He’s not actually in the story at all, I couldn’t find any instance of, like, him

as an NPC.

So I really hope he’s in the next one.

Because I want to meet Waughin.

I just want to meet Waughin Jarth.

These ones were not actually written specifically for Skyrim.

They were grandfathered in.

But they do an incredible job of building the world around you.

The Argonian Account is actually the second story in a series all about Decumus Scotti.

This is kind of like the Hobbit of Tamriel, where we’re taking this unassuming character

and thrusting them into this completely foreign, amazing landscape, except instead of a hobbit,

it is a midlevel bureaucrat.

It’s full of screwball comedy and wonderful worldbuilding about the Black Marsh which

is where all the Argonians live.

You have to fast travel by being eaten alive by a worm.

That’s great.

I want to see that whenever we go to the Black Marsh.

It’s so flavorful, and that’s why I’m a Jarth head.

Feyfolken.

It’s a story about a scribe who’s terrible at his job but gets this enchanted quill that

forces him to be amazing.

Sends himself into this madness, and he kills himself at the end of the book, spoiler alert.

But that’s not what this story is really about.

It’s an interesting fiction that teaches you about different Daedric princes, and which

ones could have caused this specific enchantment on the quill.

That’s good worldbuilding!

I am interested in the story!

You told me something that I can learn about the world.

I had a good time reading Feyfolken!

Jarth, ya did it again!

And that leaves us with the number one book.

It’s not The Lusty Argonian Maid.

I feel like I should broach this subject.

I’ll tell you why I didn’t include it in my good fiction list,

and it’s not because I’m a prude, who doesn’t love a little erotic lizard fiction?

*OOH COME ON BABY*

The reason I didn’t include The Lusty Argonian Maid as one of the best

pieces of fiction is because it’s SEVEN ACTS LONG.

Seven acts?

There is no way you can manage to maintain that level of erotic tension for seven acts.

That’s like five and a half hours!

As a person who has done one or two plays in my life, that’s just unfeasible.

Okay?

I’d like to see them try.

~I would like to see them try~

*OOH COME ON BABY*

Before I go to number one, I gotta go

get a flu shot.

This is not a joke.

It’s important to get your flu shot.

Alright, I’m back.

The number one piece of fiction in Skyrim, not Waughin Jarth, I’m sorry.

It’s Beggar, Thief, Warrior, King.

It’s four books, actually.

But it’s all part of Eslaf Erol’s story.

It is completely fiction even within the fiction of Skyrim.

The reason I put it first is because it’s the only book that was legitimately hilarious.

I straight up chortled.

*chortle*

That’s what I did.

In real life.

That’s amazing.

The writing style of these four books is just naturally hilarious.

There are so many bland, cookie-cutter stories in Skyrim that follow the same set up, twist, punchline.

This doesn’t have that.

It’s just a good story.

One of these writers was just flexing, and I think that’s wonderful that a writer had

a chance to—within the fiction of Skyrim—write something that’s just naturally funny.

You should all go home, onto your computers, boot up Skyrim, find these four books, and

then read them, in order.

It’s worth it!

That’s my quest, for you in Skyrim.

300 gold points.

That’s it!

That’s it, that’s all of the books.

So like, what did I learn from reading all 338 books of Skyrim?

Surprisingly, a whole lot.

Like, there are two main takeaways that I pulled from this.

Number one, this is a masterclass on how to write effective flavor text.

Between all of these, historical, instructional, the good fiction, and, you know, the iffy fiction.

This is a way to learn what to do and what not to do.

Obviously, not everyone is going to connect with certain types of flavor text.

I’m sure there’s a lot of people that disagree with me and think that the historical

is the most important flavor text.

And you know what?

They are valid.

And they’re wrong.

And they always seem to find my comment sections.

When you take something good like Feyfolken which teaches you about the Daedric princes,

but in an interesting way, it really shines in comparison to the three and a half million

biographies of Barenziah.

You don’t even see them in Skyrim.

I don’t care about Barenziah.

IT’S BORIIIIIII-

But not like Feyfolken!

That’s really interesting and effective.

Also it just teaches you about all these wonderful forms of fiction.

If you’re a fiction teacher, like, teach your kids with Skyrim!

TEACH THE KIDS.

WITH SKYRIM.

I got a creative writing degree.

That’s all I have to say about that.

Second takeaway, this is a wonderful teaching device about unreliable narrators.

So many of these histories are negating other ones.

This is a wonderful way of showing people you need to read everything if you’re going

to get the whole picture.

I read everything.

I am the keeper of the picture.

That’s every book in Skyrim.

So it’s time for us to revisit that ever present question, “Should you read every

book in Skyrim?”

NO!

WHAT?

HOW COULD YOU WATCH THIS WHOLE 10+ MINUTE VIDEO AND THINK THAT I WOULD SAY ANYTH- WHAT?

NO!

I BORE THIS BURDEN!

FOR YOU!

DON’T READ THEM!

NO!

Please don’t read them all.

DON’T READ THEM!

You can read the top five, that’s fine.

GRRRRR.

HOW DARE YOU JETTISON MY GIFT!

This new Sonic has a lot of fans crying heresy.

Sonic should be that cute, blue, cartoon hedgehog that’s gotta go fast,

and that’s all he’s gotta do.

But what if I told you that this was not the only blasphemous version of Sonic

What if I told you that nearly every single piece of Sonic media was heretical

I hold in my hand 13 pages that prove just that.

Before I hop into the deep end, I need to explain a little about Sega, these 13 pages,

and how Sonic was made.

You see, Sega was in a real tough spot in the early ‘90s as it tried to compete with

Nintendo and the overwhelmingly successful Mario.

So they worked internally to create a new mascot.

Not just for a game, but for the company as a whole.

Naoto Ohshima created Mr. Needlemouse, a teal hedgehog with red sneakers.

And then he worked with Yuji Naka to create a game around this wonderful creature.

A few tweaks and Sonic the Hedgehog was born.

Or at least one version of Sonic was born.

You see, Sega wasn’t just fighting with Nintendo, it was also fighting with itself.

Sega of America and Sega of Japan had a lot of tension between them, and they didn’t

see eye to eye on a lot of things, especially when it came to Sonic.

The original version of Sonic was a bit more punk rock and had a girlfriend.

A real life human girlfriend named Madonna.

And we all know that Sega would never make Sonic kiss a real human woman.

discomfort

So Sega of America started to iron things out a little bit.

Make Sonic a bit more family friendly.

More marketable.

Madeline Schroeder, the self-described mother of Sonic, wrote out this 13-page bible that

set out Sonic's true origins.

These 13 pages went on to become the true Sonic.

The Sonic we all know and love.

Right

NOPE.

THIS BIBLE HAS HAD VERY LITTLE BEARING ON THE SERIES AS A WHOLE.

But here’s the thing, friends.

It should have a lot of bearing on the series as a whole.

And I am willing to wield this bible as a paladin wields a holy sword so that I might

EXCISE SIN OUT FROM THE SONIC CANON.

I'm sorry.

That was a lot.

I was a bit too intense for...

I'm gonna tone it down a little bit.

Folks, we’re about to engage in a friendly session of biblical literalism.

Now, I’m not one to advocate taking a written account as the pure truth and nothing but...

but for Sonic I’m willing to bend my values a little bit.

We're about to take everything written in these 13 pages as gospel, and anything that deviates

from the facts therein as sacrilege.

Let’s get Sonically Fundamental.

I’m not gonna read this bible in its entirety.

You can read it online if you'd like.

But I am going to read the first paragraph in full, because I think it's important for

you to understand what we’re dealing with.

“Sonny Hedgehog was born on Earth in the early 21st century, in the town of Hardly,

Nebraska, population 1,226.”

From the first line alone, we already know that

1. Sonic’s birth name is actually Sonny.

2. He is a real hedgehog that was born circa 2000.

And 3. He’s a midwestern boy.

“He and his mother and five sisters live underneath a scraggly hedge beside the local

burger joint, and subsist on burger scraps, milkshakes, and the occasional slug or bug

that crawls their way.

They are a poor but happy family.”

From these lines we know that

4. Sonic's family lives in an actual hedge, which is I guess why they're called hedgehogs.

And 5. They have a very similar diet to me.

“Unfortunately, Sonny’s dad died when Sonny was just a few days old, after falling

into a gurgling, festering vat of toxic waste dumped in a nearby pond.”

…

What

Sonic, the lighthearted hedgehog we all know and love.

Never knew his father because he was reduced to sludge thanks to corporate pollution.

There are 30 key tenets in the Sonic bible,

and I'm just gonna go ahead and list them off real quick.

just a big ol' mess of words from the Sonic bible

The 30 tenets of the Sonic the Hedgehog bible.

Look at 'em up there.

Beautiful.

Practically glowing with potential energy.

The potential energy I shall release into a HOLY FLAME, SO THAT I MIGHT BURN OUT THE

BLASPHEMY FROM SONIC'S MODERN ITERATIO...

Pat I think, uh, we should probably just take a couple minutes, just to, just to like...

Brian Okay.

Pat I'll... do you need water or anything

Brian Water... yeah, I think that'd be good.

Now, most of these are not found in most of the iterations of Sonic, but there are three

that specifically decanonize every game in the Sonic franchise.

Let's talk about 'em.

Number 18 There are seven chaos emeralds, one is a stabilizer.

You might have heard me say the name Kintobor.

He turns into Dr. Robotnik after he is fused the powers of the chaos emeralds and a hard-boiled egg.

Not a joke.

But he was originally looking for the chaos emeralds so that we he could bundle them up

and then launch them into space, thus reversing all pollution on the planet Earth.

The reason for that is because the Chaos Emeralds “contain a microlytic copy of all the inert

energy of every gross and disgusting impulse or deed done by humans since the beginning of time.”

Ignoring that microlytic is the name of a company and not an actual scientific term,

this seems to state that the chaos emeralds are just a crystalline form of every gross impulse.

Every time you pick your nose instead of using a tissue.

That’s in the emerald.

Every time you wear your underwear five times in a week 'cause you think it doesn't smell that bad.

That's in the emerald.

Every time you go three days without shampooing

I get it.

Look, sometimes, you know, the shampoo has sulfates and that can damage to your hair.

We all have different scalps.

BUT THAT'S IN THE EMERALD, TOO.

Most of the games just state the chaos emeralds are an incredible source of power, something

that will help you to take over the world or become Super Sonic.

They don't ever mention that they are essentially just garbage diamonds.

Had Sega included one piece of flavor text, like “You got a chaos emerald.

You should probably go wash your hands, now.”

Then it would’ve been fine.

But they didn’t.

Number 21 Kintobor was a father figure.

Just as a reminder, Sonic’s dad died in a vat

of toxic waste.

Which is why it meant so much when Kintobor offered him an assistantship.

“Sonny was thrilled at the prospect.

Because although Sonny had never known his father, Kintobor reminded him of the kind

face in the photograph.”

Heartbreaking.

Can you imagine the drama in this

Sega, you keep trying to do these gritty reboots of Sonic.

Sonic plus gun.

Sonic plus getting kissed by a human woman.

You don’t need all that.

It's all right here!

You are literally pitting Sonic, a hedgehog without a father, against the man who became

his father figure and then turned evil thanks to the machines that SONIC HELPED CREATE.

I hear you saying, “Brian, there’s no evidence that Sonic doesn’t think of Robotnik

as a father figure!”

And to that I say bullSHIT.

I have NEVER SEEN HIM CRY AFTER DEFEATING ROBOTNIK.

I HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM HOLD THE LIFELESS BODY OF HIS FATHER FIGURE AND SAY,

I am sorry it had to turn out like this!

I am sorry!

LET SONIC CRY OVER THE LOSS OF WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN, SEGA.

YOU COWARDS.

And finally, the third and most important tenet that destroys the entirety of the Sonic canon.

Number 11 Sonic helps quilters.

Have you ever seen Sonic in a quilting circle

Cause he should be there.

“While making the rounds for juicy tidbits and gossip, he would drop in on the ladies

of the local quilting circle to offer a convenient pin or needle from his ample, portable supply.”

WHERE IS MY SONIC GAME WITH A QUILTING CIRCLE

Sonic CD shitty.

Sonic Mania trash.

Sonic Hedgehog 2.

More like Sonic the Hedgehog Too MUCH OF A DUNCE TO INCLUDE TO THE QUILTING CIRCLE THAT

IS SO INTEGRAL TO SONIC'S BACKSTORY!

And with that, we have decanonized the entirety of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise.

But from this scorched earth can bloom a mighty flower.

The true Sonic the Hedgehog.

What would that video game look like

What are the ramifications of a Sonic the Hedgehog game based on the bible

The Sonic the Hedgehog bible.

Let’s go through this piece by piece.

We start the game with a legitimate hedgehog who lives in a hedge and his name is Sonny.

And it's 2019, and he's got brown quills, and they won't become blue until he gets faster.

And he eats food that is similar to the food that I eat.

He lives in Hardly, Nebraska, which is where the entire game is set, so you better get ready

for running in lots of corn fields.

His eyesight’s not good, but it’s okay cause he’ll get rec specs since he is able

to read but is also on the track team.

So the entire game is actually just running in track meets in the middle of a corn field.

When he’s not running track, he’s at the bowling alley or the playground or the quilting

circle doing normal hedgehog things.

The problem is that his town has SO MUCH POLLUTION, which is how his dad died, and it’s also

why Kintobor (now Robotnik), the trim kindly scientist who gave Sonic his new nickname

and the ability to speak the human tongue, was trying to solve with his new physics theories

and his machines and all of those terrible gross seven chaos emeralds before he became

evil and also a bit of an egg.

This is especially rough because Kintobor, before he became Robotnik, would feed Sonic

really good food and was basically a father figure to him.

Also Sonic is good at computer science.

So the game is basically an evil polluting scientist being taken down by a midwestern

teenage hedgehog track star with daddy issues.

So it’s basically if the CW rebooted Sonic.

Reach out to me, CW, I will license this.

But I haven’t used all 30 of these tenets.

See, there are four of them that, to be perfectly honest, shouldn’t be possible.

And beyond that, they are impossible to put into a game.

I've hit a bit of a roadblock.

Number seven shows Sonic's dead father winking at him through a picture on the wall, which

proves the existence of an afterlife in the Sonic Universe.

Number 15 shows that Sonic is able to hibernate below delta waves.

And those are the slowest possible brain waves.

About 0.5 hertz.

To go below them, Sonic would have probably died.

And yet he is resurrected and lives again.

And number 24, Sonic is shown to run at the speed of light.

And if the rules of relativity are to be believed, that means his mass would have to infinitely

expand, and he would need infinite energy to do this.

And that would destroy the world.

And yet he is able to do that without harming himself or those around him.

Number 30 is actually within the bible itself.

It states, “But like most peaceful times in the twenty-first century, it didn’t last long.”

This bible was written in 1991, nine years before the twenty-first century, and yet it

prophesied our challenging political landscape.

These four pieces of information are not purely canonical information.

They are...

divine miracles.

So of course I could not put them into a game.

They could only fit in a religion.

So I went on to wikiHow, the foremost explainer of how to do things, and I knew somewhere,

hidden in their beautiful imagery would be the way that I could spread the word of Sonic

to the masses.

And before you get upset with me, saying,

Brian, aren't you just starting a cult

Look at this question answered by Cutegirlcorr

Technically speaking, religions and cults are the same thing.

So I have formed my religion around Sonic the Hedgehog.

And guess what

I have a confession!

I'VE NEVER PLAYED A SONIC GAME.

NEVER IN MY LIFE.

I only tell you this now because you've already made it this far into the video,

and the sunk cost fallacy states that if you feel like you've invested something,

you're gonna see it through to the end.

But it's okay that I haven't played a Sonic game.

Because that means I haven't been tainted!

I have never beheld the false Sonic!

Only someone blind to the modern blasphemies of the Sonic franchise

could see as clearly as I!

Because if a hedgehog could commune with the dead,

be resurrected,

run with infinite energy,

and HAVE HIS GOSPEL PROPHECY THE FUTURE,

THEN EITHER SONIC IS A GOD

OR COULD KILL GOD

AND I DO NOT CARE IF THERE IS A DIFFERENCE!

Hello, friends, I’d like to take a moment now and apologize for my recent outburst.

I’ve taken some time and cooled down since filming this video, and though I suppose I

could have just not uploaded it to YouTube, I decided it would serve well as a cautionary tale.

You see, taking lore to be purely literal, whether that's for a video game or backstory

for a TV show, is a dangerous rabbit hole that can often lead to anger.

Biblical literalism is just an early form of fandom.

Sometimes, you gotta be a little bit more lenient.

Because sometimes, the bible was written to make a character

more marketable to kids in the '90s.

So let’s learn from this example, and make sure to take new additions to our favorite things in stride.

Even if it’s these legs.

I’m sorry, I can't in good conscience agree with that.

I do not agree with those legs.

I'm sorry.

I could spr... if you spray painted my legs blue, I could cosplay as this Sonic.

Do you think I should do that

Do you think I should spray paint my legs blue for a Sonic cosplay

Just half...

Just half, half down Sonic.

Not gonna do anything else to my body, just...

everyone loses it 
 2020-06-25 16:19:14,459 - DEBUG - file running:  Stamina! That mysterious green juice that powers our muscles.

In video games, it allows characters to cleave dragons, climb volcanoes,

and lightly jog through a prairie.

I look at these heroic tasks, and I think…

How?

Look, I’m usually pretty high energy, but the fact of the matter is that

I’ve been stuck at home for the past two months

and I’ve cultivated the stamina of a cartoon basset hound.

I used to be so much more productive, and my energy has just completely vanished.

Is it because I’ve been having trouble adjusting to this new working-from-home lifestyle?

Or is it because my build is trash?

Today, I’m saying goodbye to that boring, languid Brian, and I am going to use the things I’ve learned

from video games to maximize my stamina.

*synth music*

I gotta go ham on these graphics ‘cause I don’t have a studio anymore.

There are two main ways that stamina is represented in video games:

stamina bars that automatically replenish, and stamina bars that don’t.

And these different representations lead to different techniques for boosting that stamina.

My hypothesis is that if I use these same stamina techniques in real life,

then I will finally have the energy to address laundry chair.

*Sad accordion music*

There are four methods of augmenting your stamina in video games.

Let’s start with the easiest one to understand. Item Refills.

You expend some energy, you eat something to replenish that energy. It's basic biology.

The Krebs cycle or something like that…

I am not interested, get that shit outta here.

The problem is that most video games are usually more fantastical than real life.

Oftentimes the item you need to consume is an elixir made from arcane magicks

siphoned from the very lifeblood that sustains our world.

Or, if you’re Hideo Kojima, it’s Monster Energy.

God bless you Death Stranding for having a magical canteen

that effortlessly turns dangerous Timefall into a branded energy drink.

You know, for a video game that loves to give you a 40-minute-long cutscene

explaining why some dipshit is named "HOTWETMAN" or whatever,

this piece of world building has a much simpler explanation:

MONEY.

And thanks to this shameless product placement, I have a concrete way to determine how to refill stamina.

Judging by Sam’s experience, it takes about 600 milliliters of Monster Energy to fully juice your bar.

And given the fact that this logic exists in a world where everyone is stuck in isolated homes

and delivery people are among the most important of essential workers,

I think it’s safe to say that conditions could not be better suited for this experiment.

The biggest difference between me and Sam Bridges is that I’m not getting paid by Monster Energy,

so I don’t have to pretend to like it.

Technique 2: Slowing Depletion.

Unlike item refills, this one asks you to do some planning.

You only consume one of these items before you have to do a huge task,

so it usually shows up in games where preparation is key,

like when you have to go fight a 40-ton pickle.

Monster Hunter has battles that can last upwards of an hour,

which can make the preparation as important, and as long, as the actual fight itself.

Kinda like eating a full pasta bake before the big track meet.

There are quite a few ways to slow stamina depletion in Monster Hunter,

but sometimes the simplest option is the best one,

and in this case, the simplest option is steak.

Steak is made from raw meat in Monster Hunter

— and also the real world —

and if you eat it, it boosts your max stamina.

But the effects change based on how you cook it.

A rare steak refills your stamina bar and makes it longer,

but a well-done steak does all that AND it slows your max stamina depletion.

The steak snobs among you may turn up your nose at the assertion

that a well-done meat is better than a wet, juicy, rare one…

But I posit to you this question:

Which one would you rather have jangling around in your leather satchel?

So I’ll be cooking these meats until they are all-the-way gray.

Technique 3: Stamina Regeneration.

With this technique, every time you use stamina, you’ll get it back faster.

And there is no game that makes you say,

“come on refill come on come ON COME ON COME ON REFI-”

more than Dark Souls.

In Dark Souls you consume stamina every time you attack, block, run, parry, roll, backstep,

backstab, ripost, jump, shoot arrows, call your mom, check your bank account…

And if you’re in the middle of a boss fight and you have run out of the stamina necessary

to dodge roll or swing your big sword,

well, them’s the breaks, kid.

Luckily, there are some accessories that speed up that stamina regeneration.

And even more luckily, you can purchase legitimate versions of these items for about... 300 bucks.

Uh, no thank you. I can make that at home.

And even if I did have the means to purchase these official props,

there’s still one massive problem.

The in-game items are imbued with dark, abyssal magicks

that I simply do not have the arcane wisdom to conjure.

Luckily, I do have one little piece of magic I can use.

It’s called: The placebo effect!

There are plenty of psych studies that show that clothing choices

can have an effect on our mood and your confidence,

and there are even more studies that show that placebos can have legitimate beneficial effects,

so why wouldn’t donning The Mask of the Child help me deal with laundry chair?

*More sad accordion music*

And finally, technique 4: Permanent Increases.

This is by far the best way to maximize your stamina.

When you’ve got all the stamina in the world, even the heaviest of tasks won’t phase you.

There are plenty of realistic games that use this technique, like Red Dead Redemption 2,

where the only way to increase your max stamina is to do a bunch of stamina heavy tasks, like sprinting.

But the thing about this technique is that…

IT SUCKS.

UH, I’M SORRY?! You’re telling me that in order to have more energy,

I have to use up all the little energy I have? That’s recursive logic.

I don’t have any energy to begin with, and you want me to run a mile? Bullshit!

So since Rockstar doesn’t actually care about realism, let’s talk about a more grounded game:

Breath of the Wild.

In this game, Link can trade four spirit orbs to increase his hearts or his stamina.

But I want to focus on this little guy, the Horned Statue.

Here, you can do a different sort of trade… a devil’s bargain. You can increase your max stamina...

YOU JUST HAVE TO GIVE UP SOME LIFE.

The only problem is that I can't figure out how I would gain more stamina

by doing something physically detrimental, like using a shampoo with sulfates.

I would never do that.

So for now, I’ll be focusing on the first three techniques.

Here’s how the experiment will go: I will spend one day on each technique,

rating my stamina level every hour of that day.

If I’m at a 0, then I’m either sleeping or dead, so most of my stamina levels will be between 1 and 10,

with a 1 being the stamina level of a hotboxed sloth,

and a 10 being the energy of a 6-year-old at a laser tag party who just finished his first can of mello yello.

My goal is to be at a level 10 at all times.

I’ll also be rating the boosts based on three criteria: Boost speed, Boost endurance, and Boost Quality.

But first, we have to do a control trial. Which is just a normal day.

“Just after 7 o'clock on a Monday. I'd say my power level is at a 5. I'm about to have some coffee."

I went about my day as I normally do, which is to say, boringly.

If we take a look at this graph, you’ll see that there were two little spikes.

The first one, which happened after I had my morning coffee,

and the second one after I hit a real low spot right after lunch.

I have no idea if I’m pointing to the right places.

“It's half past one. I decided to be productive by at least leaving my house.

Gonna go buy a liter of Monster.

You can't tell because I'm wearing a mask, but I'm grimacing under here."

This is obviously just one control trial,

but it is emblematic of the lethargy I’ve been feeling for the past few weeks.

I never got above an 8, and in fact my average for the full day

was just a little bit higher than how I was feeling right after I woke up. That’s pretty bad.

But it means there's nowhere to go but up.

And I’ll be going WAY UP with the first technique trial.

“Feeling about a 5, not super tired, not super energetic.

But instead of making coffee, I instead will go and take a swig from my canteen,

which I have filled up with three different Monster Energy drinks, up to the liter mark.

If I'm at halfway through my stamina right now, I should be drinking 300 milliliters. Let's see if this kicks in!"

And the effects of Sam Bridges’ favorite concoction did, indeed, kick in. "8 o'clock!

Let's, okay, obviously the energy drink has, uh, affected me. Let me put this down so I

can move around with my hands. I can still have more stamina. Yeah, I feel like I'm at

an 8 right now. You know normally I'd say that that's fine. I'm trying to be at the

peak performance level. Another 120 milliliters down the hatch. Let's do some work, baby!

*singing* Don't mind me, just gonna do some work right now. Feeling fine! Probably a 9.

Or maybe a 9 and a half! Maybe a 10? Probably... I'll, mmm, 9 and a half. Can we get waffle

fries? Does anyone deliver waffle fries? NO FILMING! Let's go write more scripts!" Things

were going great for me in the stamina department. Until they weren’t. *incoherent mumbling*

"The crash, and then right after eating lunch has kind of... just brought the whole thing

down to a 3. Now that I have seen that Monster gives me a super high and then immediately

crashes me, I’m going to do the only thing a sane person would do, and consume more monster

energy. Let's go to work!” And though I went searching for that magnificent, full

stamina feeling I fleetingly experienced in that morning, I still averaged less than the

control trial for the rest of the afternoon. I drank 3 full cans of Monster Energy.

“If I hadn’t had the monster energy, would I have been dead right now? I don't understand.”

There was only one little spike that happened after I had to go outside to pick up steaks

for the next day’s trials, and though the energy drinks didn’t keep me up all night,

there were some other side effects, that ultimately led to a bad review of this technique. “My

body is tired, but my mind is just, there's some anxieties in there? And also I feel,

like, physically not great." Still I had high hopes for Trial 2. Since the previous two

trials trended downward, I had hoped that Slowing Depletion would help. Unfortunately,

due to the previous day’s trials, I was operating at a deficit. "Went to bed alright

and then I woke up about 2 hours after that, and then kept waking up every 30 minutes.

I'll tell you what, more than anything in the world, what I would love to do is go ahead

and brew myself a pot of coffee, but you know what, I’ll do you one better.

Super cheap, beef eye-round steak.

I’m gonna ahead and grill one of these puppies up to a healthy 160 degrees Fahrenheit.

Let’s get some breakfast going.”

I tried my best to go into this experience unbiased, and honestly, the first steak of the day wasn’t that bad.

“I feel more powerful."

And though it didn’t give me quite the same bump as the Monster Energy,

my stamina levels rose and stayed level for the entire morning.

“It feels like I'm maintaining it a lot better.

Maybe I really am not degrading my stamina. It is almost lunchtime.

Maybe I'll eat two well-done medallions of steak."

That’s exactly what I did. Sadly, the second meats of the day were not as wonderful,

and this is where the true challenge of this technique came in.

“I do really wish I was eating something other than this.

The problem is that I'm still very hungry, and... but I also don't want to eat any more well-done steaks.”

With my stomach rumbling and my stamina flagging, I decided to try to take my mind off it by

working on the accessories for the next day’s trials. And this did give me a little stamina boost,

and that stamina maintained, but other things weren’t going so hot.

“Great, stamina’s going alright, but I am so hungry,

and also so upset with idea that I have to eat more of these well-done pucks of meat.

But I'm gonna make the last two!

Now a lot of you might be wondering, doesn’t it get easier over time?

And the answer is obviously no.”

By the end of the day, it's easy to see that though my stamina didn't get quite as high,

it did last longer, so there might be some truth to this slowing degradation technique.

But unlike the Monster Energy trial,

this one was both literally and metaphorically harder to swallow.

There’s a reason energy drinks aren’t chewable.

Luckily, our final trial didn’t make me consume anything.

“I slept a little bit better last night, at least, so I'd say I'm at, like, a 4.

But the goodnews is that I know just what to do. Let me go put on my accessories.

I already feel energized.”

Okay, full disclosure, as much as I believe video game logic,

I did just tape some tin foil onto some cardboard.

I wasn’t expecting much from this trial.

But the results speak for themselves.

“Why don’t I carry around a shield more often!

This makes me feel so powerful!”

I had a morning boost that rivaled Item Refills!

Sure, working in full garb was a little bit annoying,

but that didn’t stop me from being an active participant in my virtual meetings.

"Yeah, I can, I can help out with that, Jenna, if you need any extra help on that one."

Jenna - "Yeah, Brian. I guess so."

But around 11, the mask and shield were getting to me,

so I started altering which of the accessories I was wearing.

There’s no set bonus, so as long as I have one item equipped,

my stamina regeneration should be a little bit faster than normal.

“For the past hour, I took off the mask, and I’ve just been living on the Chloranthy Ring.

I do feel more tired. I'm gonna rethink about the mask."

At 1:30, I had to do a stream, and I did that in the mask.

And sure enough, my stamina was boosted after that experience.

In fact for most of the day, the accessories helped and didn’t make my stomach hurt,

but there were other costs.

“I don’t like wearing this mask.

I feel like my stamina has increased. But it seems like there's an obvious trade off going on here,

because, like, it's not, it’s not comfortable to wear. You can see, like, it's been squishing my nose.

I’m deciding whether or not I want to have higher energy levels or if I want to feel comfortable,

is really what's happening at the moment."

Take a look right there.

I imagine that the Wright Brothers wore a similar expression the day they went to Kitty Hawk,

because that is the face of a man who is ready to soar.

Remember how I said I couldn’t figure out how to trade health for stamina?

Well judging from these previous trials,

each one of them was physically detrimental in a specific and wonderful way.

"I feel, like, physically not great."

"Why am I still so hungry?"

"It's not comfortable to wear."

Perhaps I could trade my health for more stamina by doing every technique at once.

Welcome to The Final Trial!

“Waking up this morning and realizing what I was going to have to do today

really just made me not want to get out of bed.

I am about to do all three stamina things at once.

I’m not expecting it to feel good, but I am expecting

an increase in productivity unlike... anyone has ever seen from me.”

So after donning my outfit and grilling up a well-done steak,

I sat down for breakfast.

“God I hate this steak.”

And by 9 o’clock, I felt the effects.

“I think maybe god didn’t intend for us to wake up and drink an energy drink

and eat a well-done steak and then wear a tin foil mask.

I’m at a 5.”

Okay, so the boost didn’t happen right away,

but let’s remember that some of these boosts take a while to warm up.

And given the fact that I'm increasing my max stamina,

I should be hitting a 10, maybe an 11 or 12, by midmorning.

Except things didn’t change.

“It's 10 o'clock and I'm still at a 5. What the hell?

I'm just gonna cook all the steaks, I'm gonna drink all the energy drink, I'm gonna wear this while I'm doing it.

I'm just gonna do it all right now. I'm tired of this. I'm also physically tired."

I ate four steaks.

I drank all of the rest of my energy drink.

I was GOING to increase my maximum stamina.

“I’m ready to take on the day.”

*pained moan*

It turns out that doing every single stamina boosting technique at once fills your stamina bar so full,

that the bar explodes.

I felt physically ill and had to lie down for several hours.

I can’t even review this boost technique because it just knocked me unconscious.

But I will say that I did rebound later that day.

“So I left my house.

Came out here to take a little walk while maintaining adequate social distance.

I feel... I feel a WHOLE lot better.

You can't tell, but I'm smiling under this."

And this made me rethink some of my trials.

Most of my afternoon boosts weren’t due to gimmicky ingestibles, they were because I took a small walk,

or I did a fun craft, or I talked to my friends online.

Was I doing these techniques for nothing?

Is video game logic wrong?

No.

I just didn't understand what video games were teaching me.

Getting good at Dark Souls or Monster Hunter is about knowing how many swings of your big sword

you can do before you need to take a break.

It only becomes a major issue if you completely run out, and you have to spend a few seconds staggered,

or spend a few hours lying in bed.

Maybe the real stamina technique I need to learn is recognizing that, right now,

I may not be able to do as much as I want to.

But if I focus on the little wins,

I can manage my stamina, and I can manage my expectations for my stamina.

So although I may still wear the Chloranthy Ring, it will just be for the fashion.

And today, I’m gonna take care of laundry chair.

You tell me when the camera stops rolling so I can stop folding.

*SYNTH BANGER* 
 2020-06-25 16:19:14,460 - DEBUG - file running:  WALUIGI.

The tall bastard man that Nintendo loves to disrespect. We know he's number one.

But who really is he? And where did he come from?

And why hasn’t Nintendo given him his own game.

The cult following of Waluigi cannot be overstated. He is an icon.

The patron saint of weird content creators.

But isn’t it strange that this character so beloved by Nintendo fans

seems to be completely disregarded by the company?

I don’t believe that’s actually the truth.

Nintendo cares almost too much about their characters.

They rarely put a character into a game unless they're 100% sure it’s a good fit.

And I think this is the reason why Waluigi has been sidelined:

Nintendo doesn’t know what Waluigi is all about.

So, Doug Bowser, I have collected every single piece of Waluigi lore into this one

simple video, and I’ll be presenting it to you, so you can finally make that Waluigi game.

Wahaha!

That was my first attempt, I'll get better.

In order to understand Waluigi perfectly,

we have to take a look at every appearance he's made in a Nintendo game.

They’re the only ones that count toward canon.

If you'd like me to discuss Waluigi's noncanonical appearances, I can definitely do that for you, Doug,

it'll just have to be in my off hours

because it is DEFINITELY not safe for work.

Here’s every Waluigi appearance sorted by release date.

These 63 games contain the entirety of Waluigi’s characterization.

He is playable in 50 of them, and we can split those playable games into Sports and Party Games.

I combed through each of these appearances, grasping at any piece of Waluigi characterization,

but the vast majority of them treat Waluigi as a meat puppet. A space filler.

An extra body on the character select screen. And, honestly, that’s one way to see Waluigi.

I hear you, Doug Bowser. Why should I care about a space filler character?

Well, you already care about a space filler character.

A little fella named Mario.

Let’s discuss Waluigi’s counterparts to shed some light on his origin.

The original Donkey Kong was supposed to have Popeye characters, but Nintendo couldn’t get the license,

so Shigeru Miyamoto created an unnamed player character as a stand in.

And that space filler was later named Mario.

People think that characters have to have some deep backstory in order for people

to like them, but that’s NOT TRUE. People love Mario BECAUSE of his humble origins.

The same cannot be said about the rightfully despised coward boy that is Luigi.

You see, Luigi was made because they needed a player 2 in the game, so they just palette swapped Mario.

That is a character filling a space by copying another filled space.

As much as I hate to admit it, I will have to revisit Luigi later in this video,

because he is key to developing the personality of Waluigi, and that's partially because of Wario.

Wario wasn’t made by Miyamoto. Supposedly, the team behind Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins

didn’t enjoy being forced to make a Mario game because they didn’t create the character.

So Hiroji Kiyotake created a bad Mario, someone that had all of Mario's evils exaggerated.

And finally, we have Waluigi, who was created by the same character designer who worked on Golden Sun.

The guy who made Saturos and Isaac and all of these intense powerful characters

used his talents to make the most intense, most powerful character.

And he made him for a very important reason:

because Wario didn’t have a doubles partner in Mario Tennis.

If Wario is just the evil exaggerated form of Mario, then Waluigi's the same for Luigi.

And that’s really all we get from Waluigi’s first encounter.

That, and the fact that Luigi is not afraid of him.

*Mario Tennis music plays*

"Luigi not afraid."

Luigi, the milksop who is afraid of all, is not afraid of his evil, funhouse mirror twin.

There’s something to that, but I don't know if I can quite grasp it without discussing all of the lore first.

So let’s switch back here.

As I mentioned before the tangent, Waluigi often plays the role of meat puppet,

so not all of these games have lore that is useful to us in developing a Waluigi game.

So I’ll take them off the board.

After cutting, we're left with 5 references to Waluigi, 7 party games, and 13 sports games.

From these 25 appearances, we can take all the juicy morsels and put them into a list of Waluigi Truths.

Let’s start with the references.

Though Super Smash has notoriously snubbed our large purple child,

the trophies do a pretty good job of fleshing out his character.

Super Smash Bros. Melee lays out 8 Waluigi Truths in just three sentences:

Four things right there: Tall. Thin. Evil looking. “Seems” to be Luigi’s rival.

That one isn’t really definitive, so we’ll keep it ambiguous.

Waluigi is a mischief maker, and he takes it seriously.

Luigi is exactly the same age as Waluigi, and I do not know who that reflects worse on.

Also, I love that Waluigi is connected to Wario, but no one's ever cared to take a closer look.

Are they friends, accomplices,

lovers?

It’s unclear!

The next Smash games really hammer home these truths,

only adding that he must also have a crooked mustache, a large nose, and a love of kicking.

Hmm.

*crashing noise*

The final reference comes from Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle,

where a large rabbid called Bwaluigi appears.

This is the closest Waluigi has ever come to appearing in a plot-based Mario game.

A fucking rabbid has had more screen time than the original Waluigi.

What can we learn from this?

As we move onto the party games, a lot of Waluigi’s lore is reiterated.

The main additions are that he is a misanthrope who loves to party.

There are two strange pieces of info in the party games.

In Mario Party 5, each pairing gets a different team name, and Mario plus Waluigi are “Psuedo Bros.”

Not enemies.

It seems like Mario is okay working with Waluigi instead of Luigi.

The second weird piece of info is in Mario Party 4, where Waluigi is described with the quote:

“That Waluigi's a serious sneak! Watch out for his Sparky Sticker..."

This quote doesn’t have any useful info for us, but the phrase “watch out for his sparky sticker”

is the worst and I hate it and why’d you put it in a family friendly video game, Nintendo?

Finally, we have the Sports games, where Waluigi started.

Mario Tennis set the tone for Waluigi with two truths.

One, that he’s highly skilled as a technique player. And two, that Luigi is not afraid of him.

This one's still weird to me.

These ones all have quotes that reiterate what we know about Waluigi.

He's hardworking and he's skilled, even if he cheats sometimes.

We have some metaphysical characterization in Super Mario Strikers, where the legend states

“Waluigi's ego tends to be his biggest enemy.”

In Mario Hoops 3-on-3, his Baller Name is “The Question.”

Which I think just solidifies him as an enigma.

Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games shows that Waluigi is a great jumper,

and Waluigi’s special move in Mario Super Sluggers is the Liar Ball, which is a ball that

he splits into two copies, one real and one false,

which emphasizes his mischievousness.

In Mario Power Tennis, there is a blooper reel where Waluigi is aware that this is all a show.

Does this mean that Waluigi is able to break the fourth wall,

or does it prove what I already knew,

that Waluigi is great on camera.

It's hot under these lights, anyone else hot in here? I'm just gonna pop this bad boy off if that's okay.

*crashing sound*

And in Mario Tennis: Power Tour, Waluigi appears without Wario.

Their relationship was never clear, but it is surprising that Waluigi, who was built to be Wario’s tennis partner,

can appear in a tennis game without him.

Luigi’s still there. Why can’t Waluigi exist without Luigi, save us all a headache.

And that’s basically all of the Waluigi lore you can learn from the games. The 23 Waluigi Truths.

And you can use them to create a Waluigi video game.

And I could stop this video here, Doug,

but I’ll tell you what, I'll do you a favor.

I'll tell you what I think the Waluigi game should look like, since I’ve done the research for ya.

If you’re gonna make a Waluigi game, you're gonna need to make it distinct.

Nintendo does a great job of tying gameplay to what makes a character special.

Mario’s got platformers locked. Wario has eccentric greedy microgames.

Luigi...

you know what, let’s actually go through Luigi’s truths and see how it led to Luigi’s Mansion.

Luigi is foolish, he's a coward, he's weak, he's pitiful.

And you take these truths and you think, hmmm, what kind of setting would allow this mistake of

a human to really exhibit his uselessness?

A haunted house!

This man has been bamboozled into comedic haunted house entrapment three times,

something most Hollywood stooges have only been duped into once.

He’s a big dumb idiot, and I would HATE to be associated with him.

But Waluigi is Luigi’s twisted reflection, so his game will be far removed from this numpty.

Let’s make it.

First, we're gonna move the truths that are physical traits to the side, since they're baked into Waluigi.

Next we have to decide on a cast of characters.

Honestly, Waluigi has been sidelined for so long that this needs to be a solo mission.

Now, let’s talk about the rest of these truths.

If you were to separate them out, you could probably make dozens of different games.

A mischievous prank game. A, uh, game where Waluigi gets schwasty every night.

And I’m not opposed to these games, but Waluigi contains multitudes.

Why does he turn to mischief? Why does he work so hard only to be cast aside by society?

Who is this enigma of a man, whose true enemy is himself?

The Waluigi game, like the man,

should be a mystery.

Nintendo already has wonderful mystery games, but they’re too cute.

Waluigi is raw. He's real. To convey the complex emotions of a complex man,

we can’t rely on traditional animation styles.

The Waluigi video game

should be Full Motion Video.

Doug, I know this is a wild concept. Nintendo is not known for live action video mysteries,

but Waluigi is just the intellectual property to explore this new genre.

Imagine Waluigi as a hard-nosed investigator, struggling to pick apart the pieces of who he is.

A man solving himself.

I mean, there is the issue of casting.

You gotta find someone who’s evil looking, and has a crooked mustache,

and a big nose and is great at jumping.

And, you know, that's a... that's a hard task to find one guy who's got all those features, you know, I...

Well now, wait a second, Doug.

If you take a look at my truths, you'll find that they're nearly the same as Waluigi's.

I’m hard working, I’m a bit of a scamp, and though I might not be as tall and lean,

there’s enough of me that WANTS to be Waluigi that I’d devote everything to being him.

I need this role, Doug.

I’ve spent the past few months devising this pitch for you. No one wants this more,

cares more about Waluigi than I do.

I will fight Charles Martinet for this role.

Is that what you want, Doug?

YOU PICK THE WEAPONS.

I WILL END HIS CAREER.

And that’s why I hope you’ll consider me for Waluigi’s Currently Untitled Full Motion Video Game.

But there’s something that's still nagging at me.

I’m sure you noticed that I didn’t address all of these Waluigi truths.

Why does every single quote state that Waluigi "thinks” he’s Luigi’s rival?

You could read this as Waluigi not being important enough for Luigi to consider him as a rival,

but why go through the trouble of putting that in EVERY SINGLE description?

Why not just make their rivalry canon?

And the fact that Luigi is not afraid of him is mind boggling.

Luigi’s personality is 90% fear and 10% being green.

Mario is shocked when Waluigi appears, and yet Luigi is calm,

like he somehow expected him.

And if Waluigi thinks his biggest rival is Luigi, then how can his actual biggest enemy be his ego?

Does that make Luigi the ego to Waluigi's id? A-a-and if...

"You can't have a Waluigi without a Luigi." "He splits into two copies, one real and one false."

"Pseudo Bros. Not enemies." "Why can't Waluigi exist without Luigi?"

Luigi and Waluigi are the same person.

*Vesti la Giubba starts playing*

It’s so simple. Luigi is just manifesting his own repressed desires as an alternate personality,

a shocking twist that no one's ever done in media before.

Waluigi is just the exaggerated form of Luigi’s deepest desires.

The want to be skilled. The want to be respected.

The want to PARTY.

Waluigi is everything Luigi wishes he could be but could never be

under the famous gaze of his famous brother.

What an amazing twist. What an amazing truth.

What an amazing role for me as Waluigi.

Think of the accolades, the game awards, the respect.

As someone who wished to be Waluigi for so many years!

As someone... who wished...

If there are two personalities, am I number one, or am I the one who is longing?

Oh god. I'm not a Waluigi.

I’m a Luigi.

No no no... Nonononononono!

*mirror shatters*

*shaver buzzes*

And that’s just ONE potential ending to Waluigi’s Currently Untitled Full Motion Video Game.

If you’re interested in licensing the idea, Doug, feel free to reach out to my agent,

and we can get filming tomorrow.

Or in like… five months 'cause I am gonna have to grow the mustache back-

I probably shouldn't have shaved it before we...

You know what, I don't have an agent, so just don't contact me.

I don't want to play Luigi, so.

Pat- "Can you sob while doing it?" Brian - "Okay."

*sobbing while shaving*

Pat - "Head back."

*Brian gags and coughs* *Jenna and Pat laugh*

Brian - It's so hard to sob while shaving because it gets in your mouth. 
 2020-06-25 16:19:14,460 - DEBUG - file running:  I love the Legend of Zelda series.

But the canonical timeline doesn’t make any sense!

Perhaps it would make more sense if someone tried to put every single piece of Zelda media,

canonical and noncanonical, into one timeline.

Someone should try to do that.

Let’s go!

Let’s start with the canonical timeline.

So we’ve got Skyward Sword at the very beginning.

Created Demise, and then he becomes Ganon later on.

Link gets resurrected.

It’s Minish Cap.

It introduces Vaati.

He’s a wind sorcerer.

And then he also shows up in Four Swords.

That comes next.

After Four Swords, Vaati is sealed, Ganon’s back, baby!

And it’s Ocarina of Time.

So Ocarina of Time splits into three different timelines here.

In one of them, Link decides to stay an adult, Ganondorf gets resurrected, and Link is nowhere

to be found.

And where’s Link?

Where’s Link?

I’ll get to it, don’t worry, I’ll get to it.

And then the whole world floods, and we get Wind Waker.

This one I’ll call “Adult Link.”

In this one, he decides to stay a child, the sacred realm is sealed, he’s finished his

entire meaning of existence by the time he’s like 12, and so he goes and does Majora’s

Mask, which is also very existential.

And then over here, Nintendo decided to make a timeline where Link loses.

Link just can’t do it in this one.

Ganondorf does whatever the hell he wants to, and now it’s A Link to the Past.

One of my friends invited me over to watch him beat Ocarina of Time, because he was really

close to finishing it, and then I went over and then he couldn’t do it, and so then

we decided to go outside and play basketball.

This is that timeline.

So we have “Adult Link,” “Child Link,” “Basketball.”

Let’s go back to “Adult Link.”

After Wind Waker, he just goes and hangs out with pirate friends in Phantom Hourglass.

We go to Spirit Tracks.

This is on a different island, and technically there is Link and Zelda, except Link is really

into trains now.

Let’s do the child one!

We go from Majora’s Mask into what is canonically called the Era of Twilight.

Obviously, it’s Twilight Princess next.

Then it gets a little bit darker and goes into the Age of Shadow.

We do Four Swords Adventures, which is different from Four Swords.

One has Adventures in the title.

Here’s some issues with canon over here in “Basketball” timeline.

In the Hyrule Historia, which came out in 2011, it states that next should be Oracle

of Seasons and Oracle of Ages, but the Japanese Zelda website technically states that it goes

Link to the Past, Link’s Awakening now.

So they’ve reversed those two.

So even the canonical timeline isn’t, like, super hard set-in-stone canonical, which goes

to show that it sucks.

He does this thing and then he goes sailing and then he crashes and has a dream and then

dies in the ocean.

I’m gonna keep Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages tied together right now.

A new Link, new cycle, and he goes A Link Between Worlds.

And then it’s another existential crisis, but this is my favorite one because instead

of having an existential crisis and then going to have to save the world from a moon, or

having an existential crisis and hanging out with pirates, he just gets really into fashion

in Tri Force Heroes, which is what I plan to do in my midlife crisis.

It’s The Legend of Zelda, the first one!

Zelda II: The Adventure of Link.

This is the same Link between these two.

A cult wants to resurrect Ganon or something.

We’re at the most recent game, and the most recent in the timeline, it’s Breath of the Wild.

You might be wondering, where does Breath of the Wild fall?

In which timeline?

Is it “Basketball,” is it “Child,” or is it “Adult?”

Well guess what: IT’S ALL THREE.

NINTENDO COULDN’T FIGURE IT OUT, SO THEY DECIDED TO JUST PUT IT IN ALL OF THE TIMELINES.

WHICH ISN’T HOW TIME WORKS…

TO MY KNOWLEDGE.

*vague gesturing*

I’m gonna make this timeline much worse, but I’m gonna also explain the convergence.

So what I’m gonna go to next is Zelda spinoff games.

I’m not gonna talk about some specific things, namely cameos, or when you can buy Link’s

clothing in other games, or some of the mangas because they’re just the same exact stories

as some of the main canonical timeline games.

I’ve wrapped all of these up.

Some of them don’t have connections yet.

Don’t worry, I’ll get to it.

Let’s start with the easy Zelda spinoffs.

There were a lot of them during Twilight Princess.

Link was also learning how to use his crossbow for big game hunting, and also it was Twilight

Princess Picross.

Midna wanted to… she thought picross would help him…

beat Zant.

We’ll start from the beginning.

Skyward Sword was supposed to be the first one, but they’re wrong.

Hylia chose her first hero, there was, like, a lot of time between the first hero and the

one that happened in Skyward Sword, and in that time was the Zelda Game & Watch.

Just like in Skyward Sword, there was an upper level and a bottom level, and then there were

dragons also in Skyward Sword.

That’s my logic behind this one.

You say “Zelda Game & Watch, what about the Zelda Game Watch?”

That’s right, the Nelsonic Zelda Game Watch.

This was a watch that you could play Zelda on, and there were only four dragons in this one.

Why?

Because the other Link already defeated the other ones!

There were three other dragons in Skyward Sword, and they were nice because they learned

that Link would fuck their shit up!

Link: The Faces of Evil and Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon.

I’m not an expert on this one because I’ve never played them.

Which I think is probably the best decision I’ve made in my life.

Right over here, why?

Because in Link: The Faces of Evil he has to go to the island of Koridai.

Islands?

In the great sea!

Obviously, that’s where they make sense to go.

Uh, Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon can go there, too.

SQUADALA!

But that’s not the only CD-i game!

There’s also Zelda’s Adventure.

Ganon, I guess he stole some celestial something-or-others, and then it started the era of darkness.

And remember what I said before about how it went to twilight and then to shadow?

What comes after that?

That’s right it’s darkness, baby!

Y’all know about the Satellaview?

It was a weird thing for the SNES, or the Super Famicom because it was just in Japan.

It insisted on all of the Satellaview games including the letters BS.

BS The Legend of Zelda: Kamigami no Triforce was just basically A Link to the Past, so

I didn’t include it in this one.

But there are other BS Legend of Zelda games, and they’re weird because they don’t actually

include Link.

They include these two characters that you could choose, and they technically part of

the Satellaview thing, so it wasn’t Link who was there, but… um…

I’ll explain in a second.

I cut one of the titles in half.

Clayton, we have to start over.

A Link to the Past happens and then Link goes away on a journey into the water and then

he dies.

What’s happening while Link goes on adventures is BS The Legend of Zelda.

It happens after that, during Link’s Awakening, when Link runs away, which is why those kids

are the ones in this.

And then after that it goes Link…

The Legend of Zelda: Ancient Stone Tablets.

And technically, since those kids are the ones that are in BS The Legend of Zelda, that

technically means that they are an iteration of Link, and so BS-X: The Story of the Town

Whose Name Was Stolen, which was a game that included those protagonists, but, um, didn’t

include anything about Zelda, technically is still a Zelda game, so I included it in

this one.

Barcode Battler II, you had to scan cards with a barcode and then you would have to

battle those enemies using it.

A different retelling of the same story as A Link to the Past, just like looking at it

from a different camera angle.

Tingle exists in actually two different timelines, and he also exists in every timeline, because

Tingle is, um, the perfect evolution of humanity.

He shows up in Majora’s Mask first, and he also shows up in Wind Waker.

We have an origin story for Tingle in Freshly Picked Tingle’s Rosy Rupeeland.

He starts to get the taste *mwah* I love rupees.

And then he starts selling his maps to you in Majora’s Mask, but at the same time as

Rosy Rupeeland is the Dekisugi Tingle Pack, which was, uh, DSiWare, and it just basically

was like a calculator, and like a fortune teller or something.

Tingle’s Balloon Fight DS.

This happens at the same time as Wind Waker.

Over here in “Basketball” timeline, we’ve got Ripened Tingle’s Balloon Trip of Love.

I’m not gonna explain how it connects just yet, because I’ll do that later.

It’s the final Zelda spinoff.

Hyrule Warriors Definitive Edition, and I’m using the definitive edition because that’s

just the collection of all of them, ‘cause there’s three different versions of this game.

I’m gonna put Hyrule Warriors over here, and I’m gonna call this the TIME BREAK.

*THE TIME BREAK*

They made three timelines already, so why can’t I make my own?

Hyrule Warriors is the second most important game in the entire timeline for how it ties

everything together.

Hyrule Warriors.

Think about that, Nintendo!

You made me care about Hyrule Warriors!

But we’re not done with Zelda games.

We’re gonna talk about Zelda character appearances.

If Miyamoto doesn’t, like, email me after this video goes up and say, “Brian, you’ve

cracked the code!”

I’m never gonna play another Zelda game ever again.

This whole goddamn suit is so tight, I feel like a Christmas ham.

I haven’t connected these two right now, because in “Adult Link” timeline, Link

just kinda slacks off, ‘cause he has, again, existential crisis.

He finished beating Ganon, what does he do for the rest of his life?

I’ll tell you what he does: He go-karts, and he fights people…

FOR SPORT.

Super Smash Bros. the original one, Mario Kart 8, and Soulcalibur II.

Got nothing better to do, might as well go have fun, and you know what, I respect that,

but you did forget that Ganondorf got resurrected, and then the whole world flooded.

So that’s on your conscience.

I imagine that Link still has, like, access to the Temple of Time, which is why in Super

Smash Bros. Melee, it happens simultaneously in Ocarina of Time, because he can change

himself into Young Link, and also Ganondorf’s there, and I don’t know why he’s allowed

to fight.

I’ve put these three Super Smash Bros. after Hyrule Warriors in the TIME BREAK.

*TIME BREAK*

And while we’re hanging out in the time break…

Sonic’s here.

Sonic’s in the time break baby!

I swear to god I’m not just using the time break as a catch-all, but it does work as

a catch-all.

There’s this weird-ass game for the Wii called Captain Rainbow.

Technically happens at the same time as Link’s Awakening because it includes Crazy Tracy,

but Link’s Awakening happens within Link’s dream, so that means that Captain Rainbow

might be happening within Crazy Tracy’s dream.

So it’s very much like Inception.

And that means that Joseph Gordon Levitt exists in the Zelda timeline.

That’s a joke.

Joseph Gordon Levitt doesn’t exist in any timeline.

And these are also gonna come down here next to Ripened Tingle’s Balloon Trip of Love.

WarioWare, all of them, and then Scribblenauts Unlimited.

And again, I will explain that later.

Phew, I’m getting too worked up about this.

Canonical games, spin-offs, Zelda appearances in other games, what’s left?

Every other type of media.

I swear to god if I get one “well actually…” comment.

That’s a lost cause, right?

Let’s start with books.

I mentioned before that Skyward Sword was not the first game and that Game & Watch was

the first game.

But it’s not the first instance of Zelda and Link.

Himekawa’s Skyward Sword manga does include the origin of literally… it’s like the

first Avatar, it’s the first Link, first Hylian chosen hero.

First instance of Link.

I really don’t know why Nintendo hasn’t included the choose-your-own-adventure books

because they love to have things that have confusing timelines where Link could potentially

die in them, like in “Basketball” over there.

The Crystal Trap and The Shadow Prince happen canonically after the original Legend of Zelda

and Zelda II.

There are, like, 11 or 12 or 18 different endings.

Stick with me here: you could win The Shadow Prince with high points or you could win The

Shadow Prince with lower points.

Those are two separate timelines in my head.

So low points from The Shadow Prince, you go to the Valiant Comics, and now we’re

gonna talk about TV.

If you win with high points, we go into The Legend of Zelda TV Series.

“Aren’t I sweet?”

After The Legend of Zelda TV Series, Captain N happens, and it’s weird because in this

one, the hero is a guy named Kevin.

He gets sucked into a television.

Captain N creates this potential option of being able to summon yourself into the game,

which explains THESE THREE THINGS.

I TOLD YOU I WOULD EXPLAIN THEM LATER!

Ripened Tingle’s Balloon Trip of Love starts with a dumb 35-year-old man who lives in his

parents’ house and then he gets sucked into a book, and then he goes into Tingle’s land

and he becomes Tingle.

WarioWare shows that the Zelda games exist at the same time which is in Captain N, and

also Scribblenauts Unlimited is here, too!

I haven’t necessarily figured that one out.

Board games!

There are Zelda board games, and they also deserve to be in the timeline.

The Legend of Zelda board game…

The Zelda board game happens if you die in The Crystal Trap, how does that sound?

Alright?

You happy?

But what about Zelda Clue?

That’s…

I guess, happens, uh, during the Super Smash Bros. time, right?

Because they’re having fun together, hanging out.

Zelda Chess!

*exasperated look at the camera*

There’s no plotline in Zelda Chess.

Put it in Ocarina of Time like everything else in this dumbass timeline.

Let me double check that I’ve gotten everything…

But what about the TIME BREAK?

*TIME BREAK*

I told you that I would explain the time break, didn’t I?

And I’m gonna explain it right now.

Why does no one understand the time break except for me, Brian David Gilbert?

Why am I the only scholar in time break studies?

I’ll tell you why.

Hyrule Warriors Definitive Edition happens outside of the timeline entirely, similarly

to Breath of the Wild.

It exists in all of the timelines because Ganondorf’s soul gets split into multiple

pieces that go into different timelines, and again, that’s in the story itself.

Link figures out that there are multiple timelines in this time.

And then he defeats the thing and he goes into existential crisis mode, just like over

here, and like over here, and like over there.

But what does he do when he knows that all of these timelines exist?

He goes and plays Super Smash Bros. with all of his friends in every single timeline.

That’s how Super Smash Bros.

Ultimate can exist, because it’s everyone, all the time, everywhere, and also Sonic!

But the time break still doesn’t fit in.

It’s still by itself over here, right?

Okay, the time break doesn’t have a space.

Link knows about every timeline, and he’s done hanging out with his friends here in

the time break, so what does he do?

He decides to settle down, get a real job.

And what can he do better than anyone else?

That’s right, he knows every location in every timeline.

I’m talking location, location, location.

HE GETS HIS REAL ESTATE LICENSE.

He buys up every land, he consolidates every timeline and pushes it all into one space.

How does he do it?

LEGEND OF ZELDA MONOPOLY.

THE MOST IMPORTANT LEGEND OF ZELDA GAME OF ALL TIME.

THE ONE THAT MAKES BREATH OF THE WILD MAKE SENSE.

REGGIE: TAKE FUCKING NOTES.

I JUST SAVED YOUR ASS WITH MONOPOLY.

THIS IS THE PIN THAT HOLDS THE ENTIRE ZELDA TIMELINE TOGETHER.

YOU MADE ME USE MONOPOLY!

That’s the entire Zelda timeline, including 55 pieces

of Zelda media.

Don’t ask me to do this again.

King Koopa.

The authoritarian turtle with a penchant for princess-napping.

His very name strikes fear into the heart of man and mushroom alike.

And he’s also pretty good at figure skating.

But when you focus on Bowser’s many attempts to put the Mushroom Kingdom under his rule,

you might forget that to order fuel his violent vanity projects,

he must put hundreds of henchmen into harm’s way.

And by harm’s way, I mean in front of Mario.

But me?

I never forget the troops.

And today I’m honoring those who have put their lives on the line for a megalomaniacal turtle.

Today, I’m presenting you with Bowser’s military hierarchy.

I can’t go any further than that, I’m sorry.

“But Brian,” I hear you ask, “Why does Bowser need a military hierarchy?”

And folks, I hear you.

I hear your questions constantly.

They come to me in my dreams like a prophet receiving visions from an angry god.

Bowser needs a military hierarchy because of the Geneva Conventions.

Y’all remember those things?

Those little rules that keep you from committing war crimes?

Look, I know Bowser is a bad dude, but I don’t think that Nintendo would actively create

a war criminal and then allow him to sit in the backseat of a go-kart with a baby.

This is thanks to how we define armed conflict.

I read through the entirety of the Geneva Conventions in order to find this information,

which turned out to be unnecessary because there is a far more succinct definition in

a far shorter paper.

But do I regret reading the Geneva Conventions?

Of course not.

Knowledge is its own reward.

And could I really call this an Unraveled if I didn’t spend a whole day reading 224

pages of dense legalese for no good reason?

Of course I couldn’t.

Of course I couldn’t…

If Bowser wants to keep his armed conflict above board, we need to codify his aggressions.

So this means his henchmen need to follow a command structure.

One that is not at all clear cut in the games.

All we need is a list of Bowser’s troops.

That’s where this book comes in!

It’s The Super Mario Bros. Encyclopedia.

The official listing of everything you could ever want to know about the 17 games in the

main series of Super Mario Bros.

The main series are just the platformers, none of the RPGs or spin offs.

But the silver lining to this means that I can spend a different Unraveled talking about those games.

Because God has cursed me for my hubris, and my work is never finished.

Of the 17 in the main series, I’m gonna cut these three games, because they don’t

have Bowser as the main antagonist.

And I’m also gonna include Super Mario Odyssey, because that came out after this book was published.

That leaves us with 15 games and 226 enemies.

I came to this number because I cut out the variants.

I cut out all of the shadow versions of Mario, the minigame enemies, the enemies that are

just machines, and Bowser’s fursonas.

Because those should never be exposed to the horrors of war.

Now I need to figure out how to structure this hierarchy.

I asked myself, is there an analogous military that is somewhat bloated, often antagonistic,

and seems to be the only thing that the leadership cares about funding?

Unfortunately, I couldn’t find any real life examples of this.

So I’m loosely basing it on the US military.

That means Bowser’s military **SMACK*** will be split up into branches based on which

henchmen work best together, and I’m also going to try to fit them alongside commissioned

officers and enlisted troops.

The standard command structure that’s found in most militaries.

Let’s start with the heads of state: Obviously, we have Bowser up at the top, the commander in chief.

His secretary of defense is gonna be Kamek,

with Kamella standing by as the National Security Council.

We’ve also got Bowser Jr. up here, but he’s not in a military role.

He’s actually Secretary of Transportation.

But that’s just pure nepotism.

The rest of Bowser’s henchmen are going to fit into this hierarchy, and I’m just

gonna say one henchman per rank, the one that epitomizes what that rank means.

And I’m gonna list the rest of the enemies on the screen.

Because I do want to save at least a little bit of paper.

Uh.

Obviously I don’t want to save paper that much.

*paper guilt*

Starting with our infantry, we have our enlisted ranks with Private Goomba.

This makes sense.

It is the basic troop.

Moving up a step to the corporal, we’ve got the Galoomba.

It’s more mature than the Goomba.

And also, its name has an extra syllable and is way more fun to yell.

Pat: Look at this Galoomba!

Brian: LOOK AT THIS GALOOMBA!

Chargin’ Chuck is a great pick for sergeant class, because this troop obviously enlisted

right after being their high school star quarterback and moved up through the ranks quickly.

And now that we’re up at warrant officer, the top of the enlisted ranks.

We’ve got, it’s just a tower of Goombas.

Kind of like the Naval Academy’s Herndon Monument, Goombas become stronger and work

together better when they’re standing on top of one another.

Moving our way up to the commissioned officers, we start out with officer cadet.

And that’s gonna be Twirlip.

It’s got the round, soft body of a day one ROTC recruit,

but there’s ambition in those eyes.

Second lieutenant, we’ve got the Snailicorn.

It’s the natural evolution from the officer cadet, but a bit more dangerous.

By the time you’ve reached First Lieutenant, you’ve really proved your mettle and are

ready to show your dedication to the cause.

And what better way to show your dedication than to be literally shot from a cannon.

By the time you reach captain, you need to have a top-down perspective.

And that's why the Pokey's height is great for this rank.

Also, the Pokey understands how to take calculated losses in stride, like having literally all

of their torso punched out from under them and still maintaining a smile.

Next we have Major Squizzard, and I’m gonna gloss over him, 'cause his name makes me uncomfortable.

For lieutenant colonel, I chose Wiggler, because they're able to maintain composure and only

release their aggression when it's absolutely necessary.

But quick shout out to Stairface Ogre, who is also a lieutenant colonel and sounds like

he could be a member of the Wu Tang Clan.

Next, we have Colonel Spike.

At the colonel rank, you’re not only dealing with wartime issues, but also the internal

politics of the military,

which is why Spike makes time to have a few rounds of tennis with the boss.

A Brigadier General needs an eye for detail and a strong guiding hand.

And that's literally all Knucklotec is.

Major Burrows really deserves the rank of major general because he has demonstrated

a powerful understanding of many strategies in many different battle arenas.

But more than that, he has this tender leadership quality that makes him not only respected,

but loved by his peers.

And then above him is a fucking T-Rex.

Unfortunately, even the military hierarchy is not insulated from nepotism.

And though no one would describe Petey Piranha as capable in literally any circumstance,

his father took a bullet for Bowser back in the Korean War, so now he’s a general.

And finally, we have our field marshall, the five-star general.

Obviously, this person is going to oversee every aspect of Bowser's infantry, and it

has to be filled with the most overpowered troop.

So it's Ukiki.

This shitheel of a monkey plays dumb, but he’s the Sun Tzu of Bowser’s army.

Listen to these quotes:

And that is the basic structure of Bowser’s infantry, though there are also three special

divisions of infantry units that are trained to fight in different conditions.

The Lava and the Ice divisions are still found under Field Marshal Ukiki and they don't have

any enlisted troops.

I won't talk too much about these two, but I think they are epitomized by the Bully for

the Lava group, and the Chill Bully for the ice group, who is exactly like the Bully,

except he'll kind of go easy on you if he can tell you're having a rough day.

And the third special unit in the infantry is the spectral unit, or the Dry Corps, because

not even death can excuse you from service in Bowser's army.

I do want to talk about the implications of this unit for a moment.

Specifically Dry Bones and Dry Bowser, whose naming conventions confuse and frighten me.

When I die, will I become Dry Brian?

Is a living Bowser...

Wet Bowser?

Why do Piranha Plant have bone in it?

Next we have our aquatic troops.

Where can you find pleasure, search the world for treasure, learn science technology?

Um.

Where can you begin to make your dreams all come true, on the land or on the sea?

*SINGING* IN THE NAVY!

I won’t overstay my welcome on the naval forces because we already understand what

each of the ranks in the hierarchy entail.

But I did just want to point out one troop.

The Gushen.

Because its name is the Gushen.

And I had to learn that its name was the Gushen.

And now you need to know that it's called a Gushen as well.

And of course, the admiral of the fleet is going to be Unagi.

Because Unagi is the most terrifying character ever rendered.

Get fucked, Mr. X.

Now on to the Air Force, we start with the Paragoomba at our lowest rank.

And honestly, we're gonna skip ahead to wing commander, because most of the Air Force is

just infantry but with wings attached.

Lakitu is our wing commander.

You might remember him as that helpful guy who picks you up in Mario Kart.

But he actually got his start in carpet bombing.

And it might seem redundant to have Klepto as the marshal of the Air Force.

But if there's one strategy that Bowser's military understands better than anything else,

it's stealing hats.

And these are the branches of Bowser’s military.

Of course, there are also Special Forces.

Units that Bowser can send in when he needs something to be done quietly and cleanly.

Like when the he sent the Broodals to perform the extrajudicial killing of Professor E. Gadd.

Next we've got the Bros.

I'm talking the Hammer Bro, the Fire Bro, every bro in between.

You can learn more about them in the HBO series, Band of Brothers.

I assume.

I've never watched the show.

It’s time for the special forces called The Funny Parade!

It’s the Funny Parade!

You know about Thwomps, but did you know that there are Thwimps?

And the Whomps have Whimps?

Thwimps and Thwomps and Whimps and Whomps and Grindels and Spindels and Grrrols.

There's Tox Box and Flomps and Rhomps and Bomps and Walleyes and Wallops and

they're all pretty much invincible and they will crush you without hesitation

like a cartoonish Sherman’s March to the Sea.

Next, we've got the Koopalings.

They're sort of like the Seal Team 6 of Bowser's army.

Iggy, Larry, Lemmy, Roy, Wendy O., Ludwig Von.

Notice that I did not include Morton Koopa Jr., because despite what he has written in

his memoirs, he's never actually been active duty, and he’s a valor stealing bastard.

And the final special forces team.

It’s the Stus.

Strollin’ Stu (strollin' stu).

Soarin’ Stu (soarin' stu).

Swipin' Stu (swipin' stu).

Smolderin’ Stu (smolderin' stu).

*Pat laughs offscreen.*

I don’t know if they’re good at fighting

but they are good at being the best fucking characters in Mario.

And that is every troop in Bowser’s military.

Except for these six specific ones.

They didn't really fit in the military structure.

They don't act like military.

The Koopa Troopas from Super Mario 64, they don’t even antagonize you.

Like, they go about their business unless you go out of your way to attack them.

So, again, they don't even, like, feel like military.

Uh, they act more like civilians, to be honest.

*realizing an unfortunate truth*

Oh my god, they’re civilians.

Okay, so maybe reading the full Geneva Conventions wasn’t such an unnecessary thing after all.

There’s this thing called the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, and in

Article 8 Subsection 2, it states that grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions

count as war crimes.

And if these Koopa Troopas are in fact not Troopas, but civilians, and Mario kills them,

then that is a direct violation of Article 8 Part 2, subsection B, 1: (i) Intentionally

directing attacks at the civilian population...

Mario is a war criminal.

But that’s not the only breach, God no.

Subsection A 4: Extensive destruction and appropriation of property.

Destroying a brick to gain a coin.

Subsection A 5, Compelling a prisoner of war... to serve in the forces of a hostile Power.

What else could you call using Cappy to possess enemies

and then forcing them to fire on their own friends?

Subsection A 8, Taking of hostages.

What was Mario doing with that penguin child?

You might think, hey, maybe Mario's just become hardened after years of onslaught

by Bowser, but LOOK BACK TO MARIO’S YOUTH!

I know I didn’t include Yoshi’s Island in these lists of games, but Subsection B, 21:

Committing outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment.

Yoshi made Burt the Bashful’s pants fall down!

But Baby Mario gave the order.

He already feels bashful!

You didn't need to pants the man!

Mario has committed at least 5 war crimes,

and I’m not even including the child soldiers he has enlisted in the RPGs.

But luckily, I’ve already compiled an extensive PDF that I have just emailed to the Hague,

outlining Mario's crimes.

Still, it’s important to note that Bowser is also at fault.

The great loss of Goomba life is a tragedy, no matter which side you are on.

The true enemy is war itself.

And to fix that, we have to turn to the only thing that’s worked in the past.

Song.

One more time everyone!

We are the Toads.

We are the goombas.

So please stop jumping on each other, ya big Galoombas!

Why do we fight to take each others’ space, when there’s so mushroom to spare.

We could all have extra lives if we just share. 
 2020-06-25 16:19:40,120 - DEBUG - file running:  CASTLEVANIA!

One of my favorite game series of all time.

The myriad enemies you face in Dracula’s abode are made even better knowing that they

come from real mythology and folklore.

Wouldn’t it be nice if there was one place you could find the FULL BESTIARY of EVERY

MONSTER in Castlevania?

I think that would be nice.

OR AT LEAST I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE.

I swear to god, the first time I started filming this video, I thought it would be an easy

change of pace.

I mean, how many unique enemies could there really be in Castlevania?

100?

200?

How about more than 600.

So I booked 3 hours in this studio to film.

And then we ran out of time about halfway through.

So I went out to grab some lunch, but it start to rain, so I ate a chicken sandwich drenched.

That has nothing to do with the video, I just wanted you to know my pain.

So I had to start filming all over again, this time after hours in a random meeting

room in our office building.

And when I finished that, I had three and a half hours of footage that I was able to

whittle down into an hour long video that was very educational and extremely entertaining.

JUST KIDDING.

IT WAS BORING AS HELL.

But just when all hope seemed lost, I had an epiphany.

“I am going to throw myself into the sea.”

Luckily, before I could do that, my coworkers stopped me and convinced me that trying to

categorize all 600 Castlevania monsters was a bad idea, and instead, I could just pick the hot one.

Ask yourself, why are vampires always the hot monster?

Isn’t it someone else’s turn?

I’m here to answer that question now that I’m filming this video for the third time.

Be thankful that I’m not releasing an hour long video of me basically just lecturing

you on mythology.

I mean, who knows, maybe I’ll release that video some other time.

THAT WAS A JOKE.

I’M NOT GONNA DO THAT.

YOU’RE GONNA HAVE TO TRUST ME.

IT WAS A REALLY BAD VIDEO.

SO LET’S FIND CASTLEVANIA’S MOST ELIGIBLE BACHELOR!

*hot music*

*lonely squeaking*

Let’s cull down that list of over 600 enemies.

We’re gonna start by smooshing all of the ones with common mythologies into just one

enemy, so that way we don’t have to deal with the 96 different skeletons.

We're also going to go ahead and cut out the evil human beings, and that includes the Belmonts that

you fight as enemies, and also all of the vampires.

We all know that Dracula is hot.

We all know that Richter Belmont is hot.

I’m also going to go ahead and cut all of the enemies from Boku Dracula Kun, which was

just a spinoff series, and Getsu Fuma Den enemies, which only appeared in one stage

in Castlevania Harmony of Despair.

And now it’s time to cut the animals, mythical or otherwise.

Look, if they’re anthropomorphized sure, but for things like “Owl,” that’s not

a monster, that’s a bird.

What about ephemera like will o’ the wisps, or inanimate objects made animate, kind of

like golems or marionettes.

I went back and forth on whether or not to include these, and then I realized they creep

me out, so I cut them.

Now I’m going to cut out all of the gods and the god servants and the embodiments of

things like chaos and evil, because those are inherently unique.

I'm gonna cull this list a little bit more, because, let’s be honest, vampires aren’t the only monsters

that have had a taste *kiss* of that sexy limelight.

Witches and warlocks, zombie, orc, treant, werewolf, mermen, gargoyle, gremlin, ghosts,

Medusa, cyclops, yeti, fox archer, ogres, stained glass knight, from Young Sherlock

Holmes, where he appeared as the first photorealistic CGI in any movie back in 1985.

And finally, mummies, Brendan Fraser.

Wasn’t the mummy in the film, but he’s sexy enough that just by association.

But we’ve culled it down to the perfect number to figure out our sexy monster.

That’s right.

We’ve got 69 left.

Can I get a WOOP?

Patrick: Woo!

Clayton: woo.

We’ll work on it, Clayton.

Criteria for what makes a sexy monster: Number one, is it replicable.

I’ve already explained this, it can’t be a unique monster.

Anything unique can be sexy.

Look at Benedict Cumberbatch.

Number two, is it datable?

Can you have a conversation with this monster?

Can you bring it to Applebee’s?

And number three, can this monster…

GET IT?

We're gonna start with the viable ones that probably aren’t the best sex icons, like Mimic, which

is kind of a veiny blob.

The Two Headed Creature.

Part cyclops, part werewolf, all bad.

Wight, W.I.G.H.T.

comes from the old English term meaning human being.

It’s like a… just a blue zombie.

Necromancers…

I don’t know, they’re into weird shit.

Spriggans come from Cornish faery lore, and they are described as old, wizened men with

huge childlike heads, uh, which someone’s into, I’m sure.

Nominon is a beast that, like, sucks the dreams out of your brains.

And that’s not a very supportive partner.

Punaguchi is just a large protruding mouth.

I don’t want to know what that mouth do.

The Maneating Plant, the Wakwak Tree, and the Human Face Tree are all plants.

So if you would want to make the monster sexy, it would just… it’s just a plant.

The rug creature.

Uh, you never actually see what it is, it’s just always under the rug.

Which means it’s probably just like a cat.

Hearteater.

If you’re into bad boys.

Castlevania has some of the best design in any pixel art game, except for the Towers Guardian.

I don’t know what the hell this is.

A ghoul isn’t necessarily a zombie, it is something that eats corpses, which is just gross.

This one’s for the sapiosexuals out there… the Brain Float.

Alastor: you should be wary of anyone who builds their personality around swords.

Elementals are just embodiments of fire and frost.

Just hard to cuddle with.

The Legend of Zeldo.

It’s just a person with scythes.

They are also known by the name “the Night Stalker,” which is a big red flag.

The Kyoma Demon hangs out in mirrors and jumps out and scares you, uh, and I don’t need

anymore reason to be afraid of looking at myself in the mirror.

*pensive music*

Man Beast comes in two forms: twink and twunk.

They say that eye contact is important.

But maybe not this much.

I do think we need a sexy skeleton, and the epitome of skeleton in this game is Yorick.

Yorick comes from Hamlet, the famous soliloquy “Alas, poor Yorick.”

In the Japanese version, he isn’t called Yorick, he’s called Soccer Boy.

The Imp is a mischievous sprite.

And I was a bit worried about size differentials, but then I remembered Bee Movie, where a human

woman falls in love with a bee.

Jerry Seinfeld taught me that through love all things are possible.

Trolls.

It’s time for someone to give them the love they deserve.

The next monster is Evil Force.

And I want you to just go ahead and wipe away all preconceived notions.

Obviously, the name makes it sound bad.

Uh.

It also is terrible.

(Pat laughs off camera).

Edimmu are Mesopotamian demons that come back from the dead when they weren’t buried correctly,

which seems like super high maintenance.

The Slaughterer apparently skips leg day.

The Arthroverta.

Just a human face plastered on top of, like, an arthropod. I dunno, maybe?

Chon Chon, or the Bitterfly, comes from Chile.

It’s about Mapuche wizards that turn into this thing.

Kind of like vampires turning into bats.

It’s a neat talent.

*revealing my true Chon Chon form*

The Killer Mantle.

Comes from an urban legend in Japan about Aka Manto, which is a spirit that lives in

toilets and then asks you if you want red or blue toilet paper.

Red, they’ll stab you in the back a bunch, and blue, they’ll strangle you till you

turn blue.

I’m just not into toilet stuff.

I mean most of these monsters are pretty okay.

Um, they’re not the… they’re not like the most.

SURPRISE!

I LULLED YOU INTO A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY!

It’s time for a minigame I like to call, “If I were a Castlevania game... what title

would I be?”

Take your birth month, and that’s the first part of the title.

OF.

And your birth date is the second part.

My title would be Castlevania: Sonata of the Eclipse.

All of these games sound the same.

We’re halfway through the viable enemies.

We’ve got 35 monsters that I think are pretty good options.

We’re gonna start with the monsters that are supposed to be sexy, so it feels kind

of unfair to use them as the sexy monsters.

Lorelai, Lilith, and all of the succubi, Harpys, Headhunter, Arachnes, Dryads, Rusalka, and Naiads.

I’m just putting these ones all around the sides.

The demons.

The ones with the horns and the wings and they’re really ripped and muscular.

Mothman.

Everyone thinks the Mothman is pretty sexy.

Although this Jersey Devil depiction looks just kind of like a horse with wings, uh,

the actual Jersey Devil comes from an idea of a woman who cursed her 13th child, being like,

“UGH GOD I GOTTA HAVE ANOTHER BABY.”

And then it came out and it grew like a goat’s face and wings, and I just think we need to

start thinking of New Jersey in general as sexier.

And this might be the way to do that.

The Minotaur.

You gotta work through that labyrinth, but once you get in there and find the real Minotaur,

he might kill you.

But, he also might open up and be really lovely.

The Chupacabra is an impish little fella.

First sighted in Puerto Rico and is known throughout lots of Latin America.

His name translates to goat sucker.

Do I have to explain why...

The Fomorians are personifications of chaos and other evil ideas in Irish folklore.

Um, and they're these goat people, uh, and they're ripped as hell.

Lizard Man.

If you don't know why I'm putting this here.

*COME ON*

You gotta go what my Skyrim video.

Banshee comes from Irish folklore and will foretell the death of someone you know.

It's a bit spooky.

It's also super emotionally available.

You won't have to worry about what the Banshee is thinking.

They will tell you when they're upset.

And also when your parents are gonna die.

Slogra.

Doesn't have a folklore or mythology associated with it.

I got nothing for ya.

If you're not attracted to this, you're wrong.

Because the Rycuda only exists in Castlevania, it means that there's... very specific artwork

that you can find of it.

Very modern artwork has been made about the Rycuda, which proves it can be sexy.

Dullahan is an Irish faery that is like a headless horseman sort of character, it's

also another portent of death, but can you think about all the cool Spider-Man kisses

you can do with that?

The Jiang Shi is the Qing dynasty version of a vampire.

Keremet comes out when you bang on his pot a couple times.

It's a good face, right?

I could talk to that thing for hours.

There are so many armors in Castlevania.

No one can turn down a man in uniform.

Or a poltergeist in uniform.

Or literally just an enchanted uniform.

UGHHHHHHH MOTHER OF PEARL I forgot about goblins.

Everyone forgets about goblins though, so I'll put 'em over here!

I also forgot about Siren, that's another thing that's sexy and draws people in.

How did I skip so many of these?

The Guillotiner doesn't look like much, could be a problem, but it's time for us to bring it back.

Slime.

There are already things online.

The Tsuchinoko is a Japanese cryptid that is a snake that is fatter in its middle than

on its head or its tail.

Pat (off camera): I just don't see why it's sexy.

You don't...

Patrick, you gotta understand.

It's not about what you could first see, right?

Pat: I mean, but even after that, what do you see after that?

It has a propensity for lying and for drinking alcohol.

Patrick thinks it shouldn't be this high on the list, but fuck Patrick.

We're at the top five.

But before we get there, um, I have a confession to make.

I've kept six monsters that don't even fit my criteria, but I love them so much that

I think they deserve a chance.

First up is a unique character, it's Nergal Meslamstea.

The reason I think he deserves a chance is because is because someone named him Nergal

Meslamstea.

Of course he's gonna be fucking evil if you name your child...

Why, what is up with people in Castlevania naming their children dumb shit?

Seriously, Alucard?

Dracula, you can't just name your child your name backwards.

I'm not gonna name my son Nairb.

Scary Candle.

It's an inanimate object that is made animate, but I fucking love candles.

Next two I think are pretty self explanatory: Bone Pillar.

And if that doesn't make you happy, how 'bout the Bone Dragon?

This next one is a ghost, and I've already explained why that one shouldn't be included

in this, but I had to because the ghost's name is Duke Mirage.

And if someone comes up to me and introduces themself to me as Duke Mirage,

my pants are already off.

Finally, I know I nixed all animals.

But I really do think we should include Hyena with gun.

That hyena can GET IT.

We're at the top five.

The Malebranche come from Dante's Divine Comedy.

They're all unique demons that are used to help keep corrupt politicians under boiling

pits of tar in Hell.

They all have great names like Cagnazzo and Scarmiglione, which was translated into the

English version as Skull Millione, which is just a Soundcloud rapper.

They're already mischievous, and they hate corrupt politicians.

We can get behind that.

The Myconid is a sentient race of mushroom people.

We have anthropomorphized animalia, why not anthropomorphized fungi?

When I was a kid, my mom thought that I had a nutritional deficit because I kept wanting

to eat mushrooms so much, like I ate only mushrooms for like a whole week.

That has nothing to do with this.

I know I took out all of the werewolf creatures, uh, but this one isn't that.

This is the Princess of Moss.

The human version is based off of

PFBRRRRRRRR UHM OFF WITH THE-ERRR Let them eat cake?

(Pat: Mary Antoinette) Mary Antoinette.

I think we should have more moth creatures in our movies.

Right?

They're already drawn towards the limelight.

It's an Ukoback.

Why is this the second sexiest monster from Castlevania?

I'll tell you why.

He carries around a hot thing of coals in a spoon, and is also responsible not only

for fried foods, but fireworks.

HELL YES.

What a cool dude!

I think Ukobacks could be real sexy, right?

What is more sexy than feeding someone with a lovely fried dish?

And finally, the thing that I think should be new sexy monster.

The Mandrake.

Or the Alura Une.

Basically, any sort of plant person.

Alura Une actually comes from a 1911 book called "Alraune."

It's a German story.

I just think that this kind of gives you a blank slate on something, sure this, this

thing is born from the ground where hanged men bleed, which is spooky, and scary, but

it's not their fault!

Right?

You know, they didn't choose to be born.

Who does choose to be born?

Right?

Who chooses...

The metaphors of how our family raises us, you know, the mandrake is a perfect idea of

something that can become greater than its original circumstances.

*SIGH* So there you go.

The full bestiary of the sexy monsters.

Again, couldn't give you the full full bestiary, because that took me way too long.

And if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw myself into the ocean now.

I CAN'T DO THAT.

I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE COLD BUT I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS GOING TO BE THAT COLD.

Make sure to like this video and subscribe to Polygon if you want to see more Unraveled,

and go ahead and leave a comment of your new Castlevania title.

Maybe that'll convince them to make a new game. 
 2020-06-25 16:19:40,120 - DEBUG - file running:  Welcome to Unraveled Season 2!

You can tell it’s a new season because I’ve grown a mustache and cut my hair.

Ohoho I’m obviously just kidding.

These are both fake.

I know how much it would disappoint my friends if I changed my appearance.

I'm just kidding again.

I'm not your friend, and you have no say over what I do with my body.

And speaking of harsh realities...

The world of Dark Souls is frightening and murky.

How can you truly understand Dark Souls lore without living Dark Souls?

Grinding away tirelessly in inhospitable environments, under uncharitable overlords.

To truly understand Dark Souls lore, you must first understand the desolation of…

Working at a job!

Have you ever thought about the term Boss in a video game before?

Those terrible enemies have the same title as the people you’ll be working for

for the rest of your life!

Haha, what a silly coincidence!

Dark Souls is known for wildly difficult bosses that prove themselves on the battlefield,

but can they prove themselves in a more difficult setting:

the Lordran Hills Business Park and Commerce Center!

It’s across from the mall.

Today, I’m ranking every Dark Souls boss based on how good they’d be as a manager.

I'm not dancing this season.

Welcome to the Dark Souls Corp. onboarding seminar.

Now I'm only going to be speaking about the Dark Souls 1, 2, and 3 bosses.

No other “Soulsborne” games.

I was originally thinking about putting in the Demon's Souls, but they actually got integrated

into the Dark Corporation in a very messy merger.

All of the managers got sacked.

So we're not talking about them.

That leaves us with 96 Dark Souls bosses and minibosses.

And it leads us to the difficult part of our journey, how do we objectively answer the

subjective question: “What makes a good boss?”

So I started researching lists of “the x qualities of a good boss” on places like

LinkedIn and Forbes, and then I fell down the rabbit hole of the hundreds of corporate blogs.

And at the end of this journey, I realized... it didn't matter at all.

What does matter is making a catchy, powerpointable mnemonic device.

So here are the Five Cs that make a good boss:

Number one, clear vision.

Can this boss communicate their goals, give clear steps on how to achieve those goals.

Does this boss clearly hold their big old arm way up in the air before slamming it down on you?

Number two, consistent feedback.

It’s important for a boss to let you know that you’ve made a mistake, like challenging

Seath the Scaleless before putting on your ring of sacrifice, you absolute fool.

You child.

Number three, cherishes employees.

A good boss values employee perspectives and rewards good performance.

Like when a boss decides to die when you hit it in a good way.

Number four, compassionate leadership.

Honest. Trusting.

Worthy of respect from their employees.

The kind of boss you could chat with at the Estus cooler.

And the fifth and final C. Can really just go to town on a motherfucker.

Slices.

Dices.

Big old crunchers.

Someone who’s willing to do what needs to be done when the going gets tough.

Or someone who reveals an abyssal dragon that they’ve been keeping under their armor this whole time.

This is our main criteria for what makes a good boss.

But for 96 bosses, it's gonna be hard to differentiate their management style with just these five Cs.

Which is why I’m introducing the HR index.

If they're over here, they get a lot of HR compliments.

If they're down here, they get a lot of HR complaints.

Let’s be honest, some really well-loved bosses are very bad leaders, and some really good leaders

are SKEEZY AS HELL.

So let's rank some DARK SOULS BOOOOOSSEEEEEEEEES.

Here's our scale.

We're gonna start out with the neutrals.

They're the standard boss, so I'm just gonna skim through them.

Guardian Dragon, The Pursuer, Old Demon King, Demon of Song.

If you're watching this video and you see yourself exhibiting these lackluster tendencies,

I want you to ask yourself: What can I do to be better than the Royal Rat Authority,

who vomits acid all over the floor multiple times a day and is still considered a pretty

okay boss.

Aim higher.

Let's talk about the pushovers!

Now, these are like my favorite substitute teacher in high school, Mr. S,

who would go off on class-long tangents about his youth traveling the world

instead of teaching us about Lord of the Flies.

I loved Mr. S.

Objectively a terrible teacher, though.

Champion's Gravetender and Gravetender Greatwolf.

This guy’s so fun!

He brought his dog into work!

I love dogs!

Literally nothing's going to get done today.

Vordt of the Boreal Valley.

He runs around on all fours.

He's really disrupting the “walking” space.

It’s very ineffective.

Iron Golem.

He’s sweet, sort of bumbling, and you’ve asked him to approve your expense reports

like five times already.

Aava, Lud, and Zallen, the King's Pets.

Literally baked into the title, they're teacher's pets.

They suck up to the king.

Seath the Scaleless is a real sweetheart, but he is very risk averse.

And if you destroy his crystal, he becomes mortal, and takes it, like, really personally.

The Fume Knight.

He’s got two sides, two swords.

Look, he's still got his old sword back when he had your job.

But eventually he is gonna get rid of that sword.

He's gonna be a real asshole about it.

The Lost Sinner.

She, and I quote, “eternally punishes herself for the sins of her past.”

It’s important to have a boss that recognizes their flaws, but it's bad if your boss locks

herself in the conference room and flogs herself eternally.

I booked the conference room for three, I need to get in there.

Crossbreed Priscilla goes invisible at the first sign of conflict.

That's not showing up for the company.

Lorian and Lothric the princes.

One of them hangs around the other one's neck of the other one, who's actually doing all the work.

Which is the worst form of micromanaging.

The Four Kings.

You don't fight all four at once.

You fight one and then the rest come in slowly.

Which is kind of like every group project you had in high school.

The Carthus Sand Worm.

If you ignore them, they'll ignore you, and some people like that managing style.

But also if you stand on the sideline for long enough, someone else will shoot big arrows

into them and then they'll die.

And that's a bad boss.

The Dragonslayer Armour is actually just a puppet for these big wiry dragon butterfly things.

So they're well-loved by the higher ups, but only because they don't have any ideas on their own.

The Ancient Wyvern is the epitome of pushover.

Because you can just run through his stage and then kill him with one attack at the very end.

This is perfect for the employee that likes to, you know, fuck around on Reddit all day

and then send one email at five and then peace out.

I don't know what that's like.

I've never done that.

And finally, this is sort of a technical pushover.

It's the Ruin Sentinels.

They're kind of like a board of directors in that they all look the same and do the

same thing, which is to say not a lot.

But you gotta suck up to them if you want to get anywhere in the company.

Now we're gonna flip to the opposite side of the scale.

We're gonna talk about the sketchies.

These have a powerful understanding of corporate leadership...

but everyone hates them.

The Boreal Outrider Knight is a miniboss, but like, you can tell he really wants to be a boss.

Nashandra tricks you into opening the Throne of Want even though she just wants it for herself.

But manipulation gets you pretty far in business.

The Burnt Ivory King only comes to fight you after you kill literally all of his knights.

He gets it done, sure, but only when he needs to.

Dragonrider.

This dude doesn't have a dragon.

His job title is obviously false.

It's like if I got promoted to "Guy who had an okay time in high school."

Bed of Chaos.

Actually a very effective leader, but every time you have to have

a "Meeting with the Bed of Chaos,"

someone in HR gets an email.

Centipede Demon.

He nasty.

Manus, the Father of the Abyss.

Always screaming at me.

Bad anger management.

High Lord Wolnir has a lot of gold jewelry.

Very ostentatious.

All of his plans sound more like schemes,

BUT!

He does know the bassist for Maroon 5 and they've been looking for someone with like

really good hand dexterity and he's noticed that you've got something good so if you want...

Mytha, the Baneful Queen doesn't really have an understanding of personal boundaries.

She's kind of like that coworker who, instead of sending an email,

just peeks their head over the cubicle wall.

Except in this case that head is severed from the body and will explode.

Pinwheel can summon an unlimited amount of clones.

Most bosses wish they could be everywhere at once.

This one can be.

Slave Knight Gael came into the company with you, was a really good friend, and then he

got promoted over you, and he's been a real jerk since.

Aldia, Scholar of the First Sin is constantly testing you, because he sees great things in you.

But dude, not everything has to be a test.

This is a Game Stop.

Aldrich, Devourer of Gods has a bunch of skeletons strewn about his clothes, and those are the

people he ate on his way to the top.

Which is incredibly cutthroat, but at least he’s honest about it.

Pontiff Sulyvahn has two swords: a profane flame and a sword of judgment.

And he hits you with both of them.

He's the type of guy who sends you an NSFW link at work

and then reports you for clicking on it.

Dragon Slayer Ornstein and Executioner Smough get shit DONE.

They are a power couple...

that isn't sanctioned by HR.

They didn't fill out the paperwork.

It makes everyone very uncomfortable.

There is a LOT of PDA.

And it is weird.

Now let's move on to the good category, with the Old Dragonsl...

THIS IS JUST ORNSTEIN AGAIN.

THIS DUDE JUST PUT ON A DIFFERENT SUIT AND TRIED TO GET REHIRED IN THE OGDEN BRANCH.

That's not gonna fly!

Y’all ready for the stinkers?

You thought we had some pretty bad bosses up to this point, but we haven't even hit

the depths of bad bossery.

We're about to hit the Blighttown of HR.

Vendrick.

Dude, you gotta wear more than a loincloth to work.

Chaos Witch Quelaag and Scorpioness Najka are nude from the waist up...

and nude from the waist down.

Y'all, we have leftover shirts from the softball game, can you just go into the bathroom and

put one of those on, please?

Old Iron King is constantly working from home and he signs all of his emails,

"Sent from my hot tub."

GET OUT OF THE HOT TUB!

Ceaseless Discharge.

The name alone tells me you should have taken a sick day.

Oceiros, the Consumed King is always going on about his son Ocelotte,

showing you pictures of him and his rowing team.

You KNOW that this psych major is gonna replace you as soon as he graduates Yale.

Asylum Demon, Stray Demon, Demon Firesage all have a move called butt slam.

*camera nods in agreement*

Looking Glass Knight.

Reflects everyone's flaws back on them, doesn't look inward enough.

Curse-rotted Greatwood.

Another dress code violation.

Gwyn, Lord of Cinder is kept around because he was the founder and made a lot of money

on Wall Street in the '80s, but he’s hollow inside.

The Covetous Demon is always taking credit for the work that you're doing.

And he steals your lunch from the fridge every day, even though I label it, DAVE.

Abyss Watchers.

Infighting is a very dangerous thing for a group of managers.

The Crystal Sage does a little bit of work, and then vanishes, and then does a little bit more work,

and then vanishes, and then you see them on their instagram story at some beer garden.

Sister Friede is actually a very good boss, and should be up here, but unfortunately

she's the assistant to Father Ariandel

who is SO incompetent he can't untie a chair from his ass.

And finally, the worst boss...

The Gaping Dragon.

Under no circumstances should you be in a work setting

and described as gaping.

All that's left is the top right of this scale, the good bosses, but before we get there,

there are a few bosses that don't really fit into the standard "boss/employee" structure,

or they're basically corporations in their own right, so we'll talk about them as alternatives.

The Bell and the Belfry Gargoyles only come in when someone else is hurting.

So they're kind of like consultants.

Halflight, Spear of the Church could actually be a real-life human player.

And pitting employees against each other is a big no-no.

The Royal Rat Vanguard is one boss rat that's surrounded by a horde of indistinguishable other rats,

so it's just an episode of Undercover Boss.

Afflicted Graverobber, Ancient Soldier Varg, and Cerah the Old Explorer are a trio that...

like, they're just high school friends that decided to get together and open a burger joint,

and they're kind of incompetent but you love them anyway.

The Prowling Magus and Congregation is a startup because it's one charismatic weirdo who takes

credit for all of the hardworking people around them.

We've got some unions!

A good union would be the Skeleton Lords.

It's three lords and a bunch of minions who are recognized and working together toward

the same goal.

That's a good thing.

A worse union is the Deacons of the Deep, where the management only comes in

after five of their employees are killed.

Finally, we have the Executioner's Chariot, whose employees are trying to unionize,

but they keep getting trampled.

And that leaves us with the good ones.

There are only 13 of them.

The Flexile Sentry.

Great multitasker.

The Taurus Demon gives you the tools you need to succeed, and encourages you to climb that ladder,

so that way you can jump down and hit him on the head.

Gravelord Nito has a lot of skeleton friends.

A very good delegator.

The Duke's Dear Freja.

Yeah, she's a big spider...

but she's the Duke's DEAR Freja!

The Duke loves her!

When has the Duke led you astray before?

Come on, man!

The Duke loves her!

Give her a chance!

Pat (offscreen): Do it for the Duke!

Do it for the Duke!

Sinh, the Slumbering Dragon and the Last Giant are slow, deliberate, and they keep on going

even though they got a big fucking spear through 'em.

Elana, the Squalid Queen summons friends when things get a bit too much for her.

That’s good delegation and understanding your limits.

The Ancient Dragon doesn't actually fight you until you fight them, you can just have

a chat with this boss, and honestly, that's good enough sometimes.

Great Grey Wolf Sif is a big wolf with a sword.

FUCK YEAH!

The Nameless King and the King of the Storm.

Now, when the King of the Storm takes enough damage,

the Nameless King will put them out of their misery.

And it's very sad, but it's also what needed to be happen.

That's good management.

I fully expect my boss, Tara Long, to put me out of my misery when I stop being useful.

The Soul of Cinder.

If you kill him, you might become him.

And that's a very clear path to promotion.

It’s not a great path to promotion, but it is a clear one.

The Throne Watcher and Defender are another power couple, but they filled out the HR paperwork.

And they work great together!

They're super professional about it.

They constantly revive the other one when they die, and that's a good boss.

Also, relationship goals.

And finally, the best business boss in Dark Souls...

is The Rotten.

Because this company is employee owned.

Every movement is made by the collective.

Everyone gets a say.

Now you might think you are small, and insignificant,

and also dead.

But!

When you smash together everyone’s stinky, rotting corpse, you can move mountains together.

The best boss is you.

And all of your dead friends.

And in the Dark Souls Corporation, that means you need a job description.

So go ahead and use this handy chart to figure out your Dark Souls boss title.

And that concludes our onboarding seminar.

Make sure to print out your completion certificate at the end of this video

so you can send it to your manager.

Happy managing, and praise the sun!

Under no circumstances should you be in a work setting and described as gaping.

Pat (offscreen): Hey, yo, can I gape in here?

Brian (offscreen, laughing): You guys mind if I gape?

And that concludes our onboarding seminar.

Make sure to celebroderadfjoisfjid.

 2020-06-25 16:19:40,121 - DEBUG - file running:  E3.

The Electronic Entertainment Expo.

What began as a humble video game industry trade show has blossomed into something more

spectacular.

More flamboyant.

More… of whatever this is.

E3 is a chance to show off new games and the theatrical chops of your executives.

Because that’s what E3 really is now.

It’s theater.

It’s like Cats the musical but with more guns and a better plot line.

But this E3 is different.

A lot of companies are ditching the press conference altogether, and those companies

are cowards.

Sony isn’t even showing up to E3 this year!

And it’s not because they lack things to say.

It’s because they have forgotten how to say it.

The industry has lost its way.

That’s why I’ll be giving them the 10 keys to creating a perfect E3 presentation,

and then I’ll be giving you the perfect E3 presentation.

It’s theatre, baby!

The first step is throwing away everything you know about public speaking, because E3

presentations are a beast of their own.

You have to watch them to learn from them.

You might ask, "Brian, wouldn’t learning from old E3s keep you in the rut of old thinking,

making the same mistakes that past business geniuses have made?"

No.

And that brings us to the board.

I have watched hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours of E3

presentations and I have analyzed what makes them compelling.

I’ve distilled the essence of E3 down into 10 simple keys.

If you include these 10 keys, you will create the perfect E3 presentation.

And if you, like most people, aren’t putting on an E3 press conference, then you could

potentially use these 10 keys for like a drinking game or something, I’m not saying you should

do that, I’m saying it’s y… it’s possible.

You could do that if you wanted t… it’s not…

I did that, okay?

You can use these for the drinking game.

The first key: A weirdly high-budget opener.

It is essential to start the presentation with high energy, and it’s essential to

do it in such a way as to make the audience say,

“Hmm yeah wow they really paid for that, huh?”

Sony used to be great at this, starting 2016’s E3 with an entire orchestra playing the God

of War theme, and then last year they started E3 with an entire banjo player.

Weird thing to spend money on.

But both of these intros still get BONUS POINTS, because they started with a live musical number.

The second key is for the presenter.

They have the unenviable task of connecting with a notoriously difficult audience.

How can they reach the fickle gamer while still maintaining business poise?

Business Gamer Fashion.

Business Gamer Fashion is an outfit that is professional, and yet still conveys the idea

that this person could be seen sitting on a couch for 14 hours at a time.

It says, “I’m one of you…

but I’m also way richer than you.”

But the BONUS POINTS go to the one true business gamer fashion:

ill-fitting blazer,

diesel jeans,

gamer t-shirt.

The third key is set dressing.

This has to be theatrical, which is to say, inappropriate for a trade show.

Take a look at Sony’s weird barn church.

It was like an immersive theatrical experience, but with the 10-minute scene transitions of

a high school production of Les Mis.

But the BONUS POINTS go to live, human set pieces, like, I don't know, hanging bodies

from the ceiling that FLAIL AROUND when a character moves through them on the screen.

There’s that classic Sony magic!

I want to remind people that E3 is a trade show.

And this is kind of like if Disney held a press conference about the Avengers and then

DISINTEGRATED A MAN LIVE ON STAGE.

Now we’re moving into the meat and potatoes of the presentation with key number four:

Numbers.

Video Games are just programs and programs are just numbers and for some reason, gamers

love it when numbers are big.

A few good numbers to say are polygon count, amount of enemies on screen, RAM?

Maybe?

I don't know, who gives a shit!?

Honestly, BONUS POINTS go to saying a number that's completely devoid of context.

Because numbers mean…

INNOVATION.

Key number 5.

More specifically... less specifically.

I need this to be the vaguest discussion ever.

I need you to make claims about how you’re doing something that’s never been done before

and then not tell us what you're doing.

Here’s a list of innovative words and phrases.

It’s the presenter’s job to say each and every one of these.

But the BONUS POINTS go to the purest form of expressing innovation.

Looking up at the screen behind you, looking back at the audience, and saying…

“Wow.”

Key number six is the game trailer montage.

You’ve probably never heard of these games before.

You might never hear of them again, but the BONUS POINTS go to the game trailer montage

that comes at the end of the presentation, which is just showing you everything you've

seen so far set to an Arcade Fire soundalike.

These six keys are the foundation of a solid E3 presentation.

You hit these six, you’re in the clear.

But you haven’t achieved perfection yet.

But before we get into the final four, let’s talk about the notable absences.

These are anti-keys, things you’ll never see in an E3 presentation.

I got a list of them here…

Oh what’s this, it’s just a single entry that says “A legitimate discussion about

how to address the crunch crisis that's prevalent in nearly every game studio.”

Well I guess we don't need these anymore!

*wild laughter*

*frightening laughter*

*pained laughter*

*pain*

And now, it's time for the final four keys.

These are the Truly Special Moments.

They’re hard to build in, but they turn a good presentation into a transcendent one.

Key number seven: A “WHYW” game.

This is an acronym that stands for “What? Hell yeah! What!?”

and it's used for a game that makes you go,

“What?

Hell Yeah!

WHAT!?”

Often these are for games that are totally independent, but the best ones are for weird

entries into beloved franchise, like the Final Fantasy XV VR Fishing Game.

Even now, when someone tells me there’s a Final Fantasy XV VR Fishing Game, I go What? HELL YEAH! WHAT!?

But the BONUS POINTS... you know what, actually, no.

You only get bonus points if you make a VR fishing game for a beloved franchise.

I want to watch the Doomslayer catch a bass.

But sometimes, the presenter has a WHYW moment.

That’s why key eight is heartfelt emotion.

Genuine excitement about a game, joy, sadness.

This has to happen naturally.

Honestly, if I’m having a rough day, I will go back and watch the video of Ubisoft developer

Davide Soliani crying after Shigeru Miyamoto compliments him onstage, because that is the

realest and most joyful moment.

Honestly, who wouldn’t burst out crying if Shigeru Miyamoto, the architect of many

of our childhoods, complimented them?

You know, that, that tiny thing... that reminder that these people behind the games are human

beings and can be emotionally moved by the same experience that they get to share with you.

What could be better than that?

If they farted.

That's why key number nine is gaffes!

Gaffes are INTEGRAL to E3, so much so that they're split into three different categories.

The first is technical.

Gameplay going awry.

Cameras cutting back too early.

Mics not getting shut off.

The second category is human.

Awkward pauses, stiff actors, weird phrasing.

These stick in your brain forever.

Honestly, it feels like they’re planned in order to be meme-able and rememberoareble.

Mem- and memorable.

Memorable.

God, I can’t speak today…

OR CAN I?

THE THIRD CATEGORY IS PLANNED GAFFES.

I’m about to blow this whole thing wide open.

Everyone can quote at least one E3 gaffe.

Even people who don’t know who Reggie Fils Aime is have probably said “my body is ready”

at least once in their life.

And you want to know what that is?

GUERRILLA MARKETING.

The only reason there are so many gaffes in E3 presentations is to MAKE YOU SHARE THE GAFFES.

YOU MIGHT NOT REMEMBER THE GOOD PRESENTATIONS, BUT YOU SURE AS HELL LAUGHED AT THE MESSY ONES.

THE GAFFES ARE AN INSIDE JOB TO MAKE YOU BUY MORE VIDEO GAMES.

So honestly, I’m just gonna assume that all of these are planned from here on out

in order to make you talk about them online.

Except for when Todd Howard says something that's weirdly horny.

Todd: "You'll never know when you'll need a free hand."

That’s just Todd.

BONUS POINTS for horny Todd.

And the final key: The Big Finish.

This is a game announcement that falls purely into the fanservice bucket.

It is unimaginably amazing, incomprehensibly great, unbelievably too good to be true and

honestly, it's because it probably is too good to be true.

The presenter is gonna say “And one more thing,” and then they're gonna show a trailer

that’s probably a landscape shot, maybe some voiceover, and then just a title screen.

BONUS POINTS if it literally is just a title screen.

And then that game is probably gonna get stuck in development hell for 7 years and maybe

not get released ever.

But isn’t that what we want, as gamers?

To be disappointed?

And those are the 10 keys to a perfect E3 presentation.

Follow these and you can do no wrong.

And if you aren’t doing an E3 presentation, again, you could potentially use them as a

drinking game.

It's not like I wrote up all the rules already and you can click and you can play 'em along

with us since we're gonna watch all the E3 presentations.

And to prove the power of these keys, here’s my perfect E3 presentation.

Sony, go ahead and just plug your trailers into the placeholders I set up for you.

What does a gamer want?

(what does a gamer want, tell me what does a gamer want)

What does a gamer need?

(what does a gamer need, tell me what does a gamer need)

The games we make are powerful,

never been done before.

So let your inner gamer out, we’ll open up the door!

I know you’ll love these games, because I love these games, too.

And it feels the best when there’s an excited gamer inside you.

Hunter, Hunter, let me get off of the skate...

Jesus.

Hunter, get it!

Good afternoon, and welcome to Unraveled Games’ E3 press conference.

As a gamer myself, you can tell by the shirt, I’m so excited to share these fresh gaming

innovations with you all today.

But before we get to the fun part, let's talk some business.

Let me put on my blazer.

Let’s talk about how we’re changing the game… of games.

The new Unraveled Engine has allowed us to create experiences that are more detailed

than ever before.

I'm talking about 1,200 enemies onscreen concurrently, over 49 meganpixels of screen dissolution,

62 giganbotes of RAM,

and SEVEN HUNDRED and TWENTY THOUSAND…

I know it sounds like science fiction, but it’s science fact.

Why don’t we highlight a few of the games that are coming out on the Unraveled Engine.

We can go to the next slide.

Jen?

Jen, we can go to the next.

Next Gen!

First up, Unraveled Research 2.

Fans loved the experience of creating spreadsheets about video game lore, but in this immersive

sequel, you can do that with a mustache.

Wow.

And that’s not all.

We have Explaining Your Job to your Relatives Simulator, the Dark Souls of simulation games.

Experience the terror firsthand of trying to explain to your uncle that you work in

a very niche, unstable industry, but with graphics so lifelike you’ll feel like you’re

living in the world of the game.

No, Uncle Bob, I don’t make the video games, I just make videos about them.

No, they aren’t the trailers.

Terrifying.

And finally, something groundbreaking, something that seems impossible, but we did it.

I hope you come along with us on this journey of...

BDG Goes Fishing for the First Time

in VR.

*What?

Hell yeah!

What!?*

*Audience cheering*

I've got the rest of the press conference to get through, you

can quiet down, please.

But is that all we’ve got for you?

Not in the slightest.

Now it's time to show you some stuff from the company that didn't do the presentation,

and let us do all the hard work for them.

Hit it.

*Arcade Fire soundalike plays*

Wow.

You know, I, um, I'm gonna go off script a little bit.

I, uh, it just, I've...

It means so much to me to be up here on this stage in front of you.

It's been a dream since I was a kid to be presenting something at E3, and to have you

here in the audience... to, to feel the support that you've given Unraveled Games, is...

Honestly, it's, um...

I never in a million years thought that I could have-

OH JESUS, HUNTER, DON'T TRY TO...

God damnit.

Okay that’s it, uh, thank you all for coming.

Except we've got one more thing thing for you.

We’ve been working on something very special with some very special people.

From the visionary minds of David Cage and Peter Molyneux, we have teamed up with publisher

Konami to release an exclusive on Soulja Boy’s gaming console… you know what, I won’t

bore you with the business details, I’ll just let you see the trailer.

Voice over: Yeah.

I think it’s time.

*intense music plays*

*applause*

Thank you all so much for coming!

Thank you.

Have a great E3!

Hunter, get it!

*CRASH* Ha, we're good.

That's the take though.

*everyone laughing* Almost, almost broke a laptop.

But that's fine.

We're good.

Clayton (offscreen): Set a couple fires, it's okay!

Brian: We, we, this is the most intense...

Pat: We're not allowed to do this show anymore. 
 2020-06-25 16:19:40,121 - DEBUG - file running:  *hydraulic machine noises*

Fallout.

This scrappy, billion-dollar franchise takes a fun, kooky

look at planet-wide armageddon.

It's an alternate history, splitting off from our timeline somewhere

around World War II.

Despite the divergence, Fallout features some familiar real world

culture and plenty of cultural innovation. There are new architectural styles that are

stolen from Mad Max. And plenty of cool new fashion

that is also just ripped off from Mad Max.

And yet, even with this cultural innovation, Fallout has one massive problem.

And there's only one problem with the Fallout series right now.

Other than that, the Fallout series is doing just fine.

D-despite this one. It's just the one of them.

Why, Todd,

is the music still this?

*audio from three Fallout songs played simultaneously*

The same dozen songs from before the apocalypse.

You're telling me that humans figured out how to

make a gun that turns you into goo, and yet they haven't made any new music?

That’s garbage, Todd.

Fallout is a meditation on mutation and the ways that humanity and culture

evolve to meet new challenges,

and having music that stays the same the whole time is a plot hole.

War never changes. But music should.

And today, I’m going to change it.

*tech montage music playing*

Ooh! This is a new dance move for me.

I don't know if I like it yet.

Now, you may think that Fallout’s music is fine. It fits the aesthetic, and

it adds a sense of retrofuturism.

But you’re wrong, and here’s why.

The Fallout games range in time from 2102, the year of Fallout 76, to 2287, the year of Fallout 4.

That’s a span of 185 years. Imagine for a second that our musical sensibilities hadn’t been

updated in nearly two hundred years, and the current song topping the Billboard charts

was The Alphabet Song, a song literally written about 185 years ago.

Actually, that kind of sounds possible. Modern times are weird.

What I’m saying is that if 80% of humans died today, in 100 years,

we'd still have Old Town Road, but it would have a few more remixes.

Do you really think that if the world ended in 1997, our culture would linger over

"Barbie Girl" and "Tubthumping"? That we would be complacent with the cultural detritus of euro-techno,

manufactured pop, and third-wave ska?

NO!

And yet it seems the people of Fallout have

forgotten how to make music.

Fallout 76 is littered with instruments and bandstands and stages,

but by the time you get to Fallout 3, the only instrument left is a Stradivarius

violin locked in a vault surrounded by mirelurks.

Fallout 76 also has the highest track count,

nearly twice as many as all of the other games, which implies that these tracks are being

lost over time, and nothing is there to replace it.

Only two people in the entire 185-year-span

of these games are making new songs. The first is a synth that makes the same bluesy style

as the rest of the music.

It’s good but it’s not different.

The other is a burnout DJ who does not seem to know how to sing or play an instrument.

And yet he still insists on playing a guitar,

which goes to prove that even in the apocalypse, you can’t escape

the guy who will bring his guitar to your party.

Thank god the bombs went off before "Wonderwall."

People need food to eat, sure, and, you know, clothes to cover their sinful

bods so that makes sense that those areas have continued to flourish. But Fallout is

a world where people have ignored the basic human endeavor of making art.

I won’t stand for that!

We need art because of its fundamental importance to human expression.

Songs were made long before written language to help keep stories alive, and they'd be added to

and embellished, much like the cultural touchstone of our time,

TVTropes.org.

Science may improve our health and longevity, but art is what makes long life worth living.

And that’s why I am here — to scientifically improve on this art,

and synthesize a totally new genre of music that we should be hearing in the Fallout universe.

This genre should be inspired by the music landscape and culture of Fallout's world.

Any cultural step that goes One Step Beyond current accepted standards

risks alienating its audience by being too challenging,

too intelligent.

So let’s guide our creation by considering the 10 definitive purposes of music

and how they fit into the beautiful wasteland of Todd’s mindscape.

First, to create or control emotion.

From the soaring, triumphant music of Jurassic Park

to the ice cream truck version of "Pop Goes the Weasel,"

which, for reasons I don’t understand, always makes me cry.

Evoking emotion is the number one use for music.

So what does that mean for Fallout? Well, one thing the soundtrack does get right is the upbeat tempo

of most of the songs. It cheers up the experience of playing through the wasteland.

Except for the miserable, inescapable energy of "Johnny Guitar."

Play it again, my Johnny.

In the wasteland, you need something to rev you up, keep you moving. And that's why this new genre

will only feature peppy songs.

Two: remembering or sharing information.

These can be simple mnemonics like Schoolhouse Rock! Or classic story ballads

like Kesha’s "TiK ToK."

I actually believe these will be more important than emotions just because

written language seems to be pretty dead in the future. It’s all on abandoned computers

or in diaries safely tucked up in a skeleton's ribcage.

Up-to-date information is transmitted verbally, and think about how much further it could go if it was sung.

Even an S.O.S. signal gets more traction if it comes with a little ditty,

and I learned that from Rihanna.

Three: Entertainment.

*cheesy music plays*

Four: Jingles. In other words,

propaganda.

Commercial jingles are designed to make you remember brands, and political songs fit here, too.

Because what is the "Star Spangled Banner" if not America’s jingle?

Despite the amount of remnant advertising for companies like Nuka-Cola and Radiation King,

the only jingles that remain in Fallout are the ones on Gene Autry’s spurs.

*(I Got Spurs That) Jingle, Jangle, Jingle plays ominously*

In the song he says his spurs jingl-

Fallout does have a few antiquated political songs on Enclave Radio, but as Plato said:

“Any musical innovation is full of danger to the whole State...

when modes of music change, the State always changes with them.”

Thank you, Plato.

The transitive property means that the opposite must be true as well.

Fallout’s state has very much changed, and so too should the music.

So our music genre should be catchy to the point of propaganda.

You hear this song once, and you know the hook and exactly what it wants you to do.

Five: To mark time rhythmically in a group, like a chain gang or rowing.

An underlying theme of Fallout is a disruption of low-wage labor systems.

Half the locations are robot warehouses or Nuka-Cola factories

or the industrial goo pit where The Joker was made.

In the 2100s, commerce is no longer the main structure around

which a human’s life is organized.

So fuck the Man, and fuck the beat he made you drum to.

The Man was beating you down, so we’re gonna focus on the up-beats.

The off-beats. Something more syncopated.

This isn't to say we're going to get overly complicated with 7/4s and 15/8 time signatures.

Those time signatures only belong in math rock,

which is to say in the garbage.

We’re taking back 4/4 from the Man and we're making it our own.

Six: Tradition music, to mark events or occasions.

This can range from singing "Auld Lang Syne" on New Years

to playing "Pop Goes the Weasel" whenever one of your pet weasels died when you were a kid.

THAT'S WHY.

They’re just songs that usher in a specific moment, like an alarm.

But most cultures in Fallout don’t seem to use them.

At the end of the quest “A Nice Day for a Right Wedding,” there is a wedding but no wedding march.

And in the quest “For Auld Lang Syne,” they do not play "Auld Lang Syne."

Which means there’s a real opening to be the only tradition song for every holiday in Fallout.

It may seem lame to force a tradition song, like making all of your friends call you by a nickname you gave yourself,

but if you believe that every tradition song came about naturally, you’re naive.

You think Vitamin C didn’t know that the graduation song would become a once-a-year cash cow?

That when Green Day was writing “Good Riddance” they weren’t

thinking “Some sitcoms are gonna have to end someday.”

Tradition songs can be crafted,

and our first song in this new genre will fit this bill.

Seven: Ambient music or background music.

A.K.A. Chill anime beats to study and relax to.

Nobody in Fallout is studying or relaxing. This one is a guide on what not to do in our new genre.

Our genre should be present and aggressive, and when you’re listening to it, you are listening to it.

Eight: To create or maintain social groups.

Without labor to constrict a person’s time or movement,

people organize into social, cult-like gangs, which makes this category

a big one. You’ve got LARPers, the AV club, the rude boys, all of which have their own

cultural standards. But there is a distinct lack of punks, which came about through a

shared political consciousness expressed through music. But we can be that, we just need to

include identity-establishing lyrics that appeal to all denizens of the Wasteland.

Perhaps this genre will help unify all of the many warring factions.

Or at least create a new, very cool warring faction.

Number nine: Stimulating physical movement. Dancing.

There is no dancing in Fallout! Well, there are a few sex workers in Fallout New Vegas that dance, but it kind

of just looks like the dancing baby gif, so I don’t think that should count.

And Fallout 76 hasn’t included a singular dancing emote. All they have are things like “smoking kills”

and “join my polycule?”

This is probably to avoid overlapping with Fortnite, which

does have a pretty long head start on dancing emotes. So for the sake of originality, I

had my research assistant, Google, find all of the dances that haven't been included in Fortnite yet.

It's just a Regency-era quadrille, and skanking.

We will make it work.

And the tenth purpose of music is to use it as a crutch when you can’t think of a different way

to end a video.

Actually, I don't think this one really applies to the Fallout universe,

so I'm just gonna take it off.

So with our nine definitive purposes of music, we can

begin to build our genre. And the more I’m thinking about these nine purposes, the more

I'm realizing that Fallout has the opportunity to create the perfect genre. One not tied

down to the whims of society.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

The current music in Fallout is overwhelmingly jazz standards and rhythm and blues,

so we'll incorporate elements from those genres.

We’ll have heavy beats, syncopation, rhythm guitar, and honestly, any instrument

that fits in a mobile wasteland setting. So no pianos, but any marching instrument, like

trumpets and trombones. Things that stand up to roughing it and also would appeal to

the Brotherhood of Steel. Another thing these jazz standards excel at is having a powerful,

catchy melody sung by a main vocalist, but since it’s hard to maintain your safety

as a loner in the wasteland, we can have a lot of backing vocalists, too.

If you can carry a gun, you can carry a tune.

In terms of topics for the songs, we'll keep the themes

relevant to the people of Fallout, which based on my experience seems to be freedom from

tyranny, looting, and drinking so I can be stronger and carry more loot.

Now, we mix together these in-fiction elements with our nine definitive purposes of music.

One: We’re gonna make people happy. Needs to be Jeep commercial music. Yeah, your wife just got

eaten by a yao guai, but listen to that skiffle.

Two: All of our heroes are dead. So it's time

to make new heroes. How else are we gonna know how many beers Janice drank last week,

or how far Kevin’s head went flying when a super mutant tagged him with a fire hydrant.

Three:

Bangers only.

Four: What should I do with the information about how many beers

Janice drank? Tell me.

This is music for the scavenger, not the assembly line worker. There’s

a whole world of useful scrap out there, and this music should inspire you to get out there

and pick it up!

Six: The old ways are dead! And we've gotta make new songs to celebrate

the new ways. There is no song for when your Swamp Itch clears up.

But there should be.

Seven: Background music? NO. This is FOREGROUND MUSIC.

Eight: Fallout is a world divided,

awaiting a messiah of music to bring them all together

or at least inspire them to wear cooler clothes.

Nine: The music should inspire dances that are violent and rushed, just like

the world you're in. Yeah, your fists are used for melee, but that leaves your feet

and your elbows open to fuckin' jam!

You starting to imagine it? You starting to hear those first few notes in your head? THAT’S GOOD!

What are we gonna call this new genre that

is peppy! Informational! Good! Catchy! Pick up loot!

Traditional! In your face! Punk!

Kicks! Energetic! Educational! Fun! Sticks in your head! Pick it up!

For your cousin Ben's wedding! Right there! Society.

*dancing noises*

Spicy! Slaps hard! Pick it up! Propaganda.

Arbor Day! Pick it up!

Fuck you, Philip Glass!

Pick it up! Let's all wear the same shoes!

*repeating "DANCE!" and "PICK IT UP" over and over*

Pick it up!

*heavy breathing*

Did I just make Ska again?

*Ska music starts*

You spend your life living in a vault, and your mind begins to crack.

And when you get outside, there’s nothing to welcome you back.

She found me passed out in a rundown shack with Nuka Buzz in my hand.

She picked me up and she slapped my face, and said "Come on let’s start a band!"

She said: START THE MUSIC, Pick up loot, get off your ass!

If you don’t feel the Brotherhood of Steel, join the Brotherhood of Brass.

She said: START THE NEW, War never changes, that’s a bore!

You know we’ll eclipse the apocalypse

with a loud and brassy SKALLOUT WAR.

SKALLOUT WAR!

SKALLOUT WAR!

SKALLOUT WAAAAAAAAR!

SKALLOUT WAR!

I've never skanked so hard in my life. 
 2020-06-25 16:19:40,121 - DEBUG - file running:  Fire Emblem!

This magnificent franchise pushes the boundaries of gaming by daring to ask the question,

"What if chess made you horny?"

Fire Emblem is turning 30 next year, and with 16 main games and few spinoffs,

it's safe to say that it has grown into something extraordinary.

The games are packed with deep storylines and memorable characters, like Marth.

That's not Marth? Marth.

That's- which one is Marth?

Marth.

The problem with having such a prolific series is that the characters start to blend together.

One needs only to look at the Super Smash Bros. roster to see that

Fire Emblem characters are a bit hard to differentiate.

It's like trying to remember your coworkers' names after meeting them once at a work mixer.

Except in this case, your coworkers all have swords and can only make one facial expression.

But do not worry. There is an answer to this conundrum. Because today,

I'm going to teach you how to tell apart every Fire Emblem character.

*cheery synth music*

My face is just not built for this expression.

First step in this process is to collect a list of the characters.

Turns out, even after trimming the nonplayable ones and the ones from the Tokyo Mirage Sessions,

there are nearly 600 Fire Emblem characters.

I cannot explain that many characters.

I have made that mistake before.

"Trying to categorize all 600 Castlevania monsters was a bad idea."

But the beauty of making mistakes is that you can learn from them. And I now know understand

that explaining 600 discrete characters wouldn't actually be helpful.

Human beings aren't meant to remember 600 people perfectly. If you don't believe me,

just try to remember something about every single person in your contact list.

I have a contact for someone name Zain.

And in the company, it just says "Bocce Ball."

Who the fuck is this?

But unlike my contact list, Fire Emblem's have plotlines.

And in my experience playing these games, I noticed

that a lot of these different characters fit similar roles in their respective games.

And I'm not the only one who's noticed this. On the Fire Emblem wiki, there is a whole list

of archetypes based on different characters.

A list that I only found after spending whole day trying to categorize them on my own.

And it's just so fun to realize that you've wasted a whole day of work.

But this list intrigued me.

Stock characters in similar circumstances playing again and again in different stories.

Does that remind you of anything?

Of course it does!

It reminds you of the commedia dell'arte,

because it reminds me of the commedia dell'arte.

And it's so obviously the commedia dell'arte that I don't need to explain it.

But I will for the sake of extending this video.

The commedia dell'arte was an Italian form of theater that was big in the 16th to 18th centuries,

and it relied on stock characters wearing masks or costumes to designate who they were.

That way the audience could be like,

"Ah, that dude's wearing a tight fitting suit with a bunch of weird patches, that must

be Arlecchino, the servant clown — sometimes to two masters!"

This brought the audience in immediately. They knew what that character was about without any exposition.

In the same way, Fire Emblem has dozens of recurring characters that get you through each game.

And this is how we're going to tell them apart. By defining their archetypes.

Fire Emblem goes one step further.

Because these characters can not only serve the same story purpose,

but they can have a similar role in the gameplay.

And this goes to prove my theory

that Fire Emblem is not only the spiritual successor to commedia dell'arte,

it is its natural evolution.

An elevated form I call...

THE COMMEDIA DELL'ANIME.

The newer, more perfect form of theater.

We just have to boil down the Fire Emblem personnel into

*kiss*

syrupy stock characters.

Let's begin with the archetypes that are standard.

Cain and Abel are battle bros. They fight together, but not in the biblical sense.

Bord and Cords are similar except they're usually axe fighters.

Pegasus sisters are a trio of flying horses ladies.

You can't split these archetypes up into their solo characters because their bond is what defines them.

You can't have a Waluigi without a Luigi.

And in the same way, you can't have a Bord without a Cord.

Which is my favorite Dr. Seuss book.

Jagens are mentors that are strong in the beginning and then you'll quickly outpace them, and it's kind of sad.

Like the first time you beat your dad in a basketball game.

Oifeys are similar to Jagens,

except they'll keep dunking on you till you're dead.

Wendells but for magic.

Gotohs are mentors but only the last half of the game.

Beowolfs are mercenaries that you have to pay actual in-game currency

to recruit, and Ogmas are mercenaries that usually decide to join you out of their own volition.

Which is, by definition, not a mercenary.

Navarres are silent, moody sword swingers.

Kind of like if that person who said they studied the blade actually studied the blade.

There are also a bunch of villains but for different reasons. Power. Ambition. Loyalty.

Wyvern riding, I guess.

And getting possessed, which is a classic mistake.

Some archetypes are based on their gameplay requirements.

Very difficult to recruit.

Usually recruited after they've been kidnapped.

Late game recruits that could be good, but you have to work hard.

Super low level villagers that could also be good.

And if you recruit one of these pairs,

you can't get the other.

Kind of like if two of your friends start dating and then have a really messy breakup.

Corneliuses are usually the parental figure to the main character,

and they have this nasty habit of getting axed super early on in the game.

It's kind of like Fire Emblem doesn't know how to make interesting characters without making them

suffer traumatic parental death.

Tacticians. Young female mages. Young female healers.

Young male mages.

Thieves.

Jeorges do that thing where they pretend to be not important

and then SURPRISE, I wasn't an old crone, I was a magical witch the whole time!

Except they're not very good at hiding the fact that they're important.

And the creepy version of the Jeorges:

The Tikis.

Usually they take the form of a small girl or adolescent, except

they're really 400 years old and a god or a dragon.

And I honestly do not have the time to unpack this bullshit.

These 29 archetypes are useful, but they only cover 229 characters.

There are still 367 to go. If we keep this up, we're going to end up with 75 archetypes.

The commedia dell'arte only has about 17.

So before we move on, let's combine some.

These six are all mentors to varying degrees of usefulness.

These are all defined by their villainy and only some of them become playable.

Welcome to Cain Siblings Incorporated, where we all have a sibling like bond and do the same job.

These all have very specific requirements for recruiting.

These both do that thing where they don't seem important and then Surprise!

I'm important!

These are all hard to make good but they're worth it if you put the effort in.

These are all precocious little magic babies.

And that leaves the Navarres unconnected,

but that's because I'm changing the archetype to Spicy Swords. Because we can include so

many other characters if we just expand the definitions to any swordweilder

who's a little spicy.

In fact, by combining these other archetypes, there are now tons of other characters who

fit into these expanded definitions.

We are left with 288 characters to categorize. But before I get there,

I just want to commend Fire Emblem for have 596 playable characters

and only repeating three names.

When I was hired for my first job at a climbing gym,

I was one of five employees named Brian, and it was a small gym.

But I guess it's pretty easy to cut out repetitions when you use dope-ass names like Skrimir.

Dagdar.

Sleuf.

Fjorm.

Belf.

I could go on all day.

But I won't. Because it's time to get the rest of the archetypes on the wall.

*charging noise*

That took like 30 minutes. But let's begin.

The honorable knight, like Fiona, who cares passionately about her people,

and will always oppose cruelty to civilians.

Which is way better than the loyal knight, like Troude, who only is loyal

to Perne, and will do literally anything for him even though Perne is a bad dude.

But I'll get to that later.

These four archetypes are calm and aloof, and the only thing that differentiates them

is how much you would want to invite them to your birthday party.

I'm just gonna get the blank slate archetype out of the way now,

because Fire Emblem is a game with permadeath,

and so sometimes you just need more meat for the grinder, you know?

Similar to the blank slate is the protagonist,

which is always relatively heroic, but since they're a conduit for the player, they're all pretty vague.

I realize that by smooshing them all together into one category,

I've made the majority of the Fire Emblem roster in Super Smash indistinguishable.

But that's not my fault!

Super Smash should've included more magic babies!

Arrogants, hotheads, and edgelords all have a mean side,

but arrogants like Vaike just think they're the best.

Hotheads like Caspar want to fight anything that moves.

And edgelords like Niles retweet Joker accounts unironically.

A lot of these characters have rough childhoods but then turn out cheerful despite that.

And then there's the inferiority complex archetype, which I could have just called

"The majority of children in Fire Emblem: Fates."

Perfectionists, mischief makers, and flirts are all highly motivated.

But Subaki is motivated to meet high expectations.

Claude is motivated to make intricate schemes.

And Sylvain is motivated to be a fuccboi.

Buzzkills are just characters that aren't very fun to talk to.

And Fire Emblem, I will never forgive you for naming an unemotional, uber religious, deadbeat dad Gilbert.

It also doesn't help that I look like Hanneman Lite.

Oh god, am I a buzzkill?

A lot of these archetypes are based around one singular personality trait.

Scarlet's straightforward. Valbar's chill.

Linhardt's lazy. Sumia's clumsy. Petra's a sweetie.

And Ranulf is a furry.

Dramatic, painter, and fashionable are defined by their love of the arts

and how much it sucks that they gotta be a soldier instead.

Some archetypes upset the status quo by defying gender norms

or by calling out the noble class, and that's why they're comrades.

Child soldier.

Karin is canonically 14 years old.

Whoopsie!

But even if they aren't a child, they could still be naive.

Which brings around the overprotective archetype,

which is just essentially helicopter parents.

Manuela is constantly drinking and flirting and just being a hot mess and I love her for it.

And that makes her the president of vices.

The vice president.

But be careful not to do that around someone like Astram, who is constantly accusing people of treason

for no good reason.

There's a lot of characters in the meek murderer archetype

because Fire Emblem loves to make characters that are quiet and shy and really self conscious,

and then can WRECK SHOP on the battlefield.

Here's an archetype I call "what the fuck" and it's the three characters that make me say,

"What the fuck, Fire Emblem?"

People like Perne, who is said to be a sweet Robin Hood type,

except he does kidnap a young girl and keeps her as his slave.

Or Tharja, who practices curses on her own daughter.

Or Roger, who is act- he's not actually that bad.

But Fire Emblem does go out of their way to make his endscreen say that he never gets a date

and he stays single for the rest of his life.

And it's like, what the fuck, Fire Emblem? You didn't have to do him dirty like that.

The next archetype is called "actually pretty interesting." These characters are three dimensional

and well-developed. People like Libra, who struggles with his faith and has incredible

self doubt even though he's doing all he can to help those around him. Or Rhys, who dreams

of being a swordfighter, but his weak constitution won't allow him to become one. And so he helps

in the ways he can, but his whole story is one of unfulfilled dreams.

And that's it.

Those are the only two interesting characters in Fire Emblem.

Until we get to Raphael.

My sweet, bulky boy who only cares about eating and training and not about studying.

The thing is, the Fire Emblem world has moved past himbos and bimbos.

Welcome to the age of thembos.

There. 45 archetypes to help you differentiate the 596 Fire Emblem characters.

If you're a GOSH DANG ROCKET SCIENTIST!

45 is still too much! We can combine these.

We'll take these six and combine them to create a new archetype that is as important as it is bland.

These three can be more succinctly summarized in a category called

"Holy shit, why are you a soldier?"

Let's just go ahead and cordon off all of the assholes.

And now we can take these straight-talking suck ups and call them teacher's pets.

Shhhh.

These three archetypes all have tough exteriors to break through.

These three archetypes really explore familial bonds,

which is a RARE CONDITION, IN THIS DAY-

Whether it's a good or bad reaction doesn't matter to this group, they just want to be seen.

They're just too nice for all this!

These four archetypes will always be subverting expectations.

It's fairly surprising that these three archetypes were let in.

Chill dudes? Gambling? A bunch of hunks?

Damn if these aren't fun to hang out with.

All three of these are going to time out, 'cause they need to calm it down.

And there we go.

The 13 archetypes that make it possible to differentiate the Fire Emblem characters.

Just 13 of them.

That's fewer than the commedia dell'arte.

It's only 13.

Which is not only an unlucky number,

but it is TOO LARGE for your TINY CHILD BRAINS.

We can make it better! We can combine more! WE CAN PERFECT THIS!

Granted, it's a little bit harder to combine these archetypes, but just off the bat, we can take

"look at me baby" and "making waves" and just combine it into one thing, trendsetters.

And the "necessary but boring" and the "asshole crew" and the "teacher's pets" and the "calm it downs,"

they all fill me with a sense of UGH.

And obviously the "too nice for this" and the "lied on your resume" and the "holy shit why are you a soldiers"

are all just a bad choice for a war!

And that just leaves us with the characters that are hard to break

the ice with, and uh, the ones that got family issues, and the quiet ones, and the ones that

are fun to hang out with!

Uh.

And that just sounds like a pretty run-of-the-mill

awkward family reunion.

And when you think about it, these ones are just strange characters that

have, uh, that are good at fighting.

I mean if you include Dmitri in this, he has an eye patch!

Okay, which is similar to these ones.

Seteth and Byleth have the, they rhyme.

Uh we also, I mean.

Dorothea wears a hat until she grows out of the hat.

Think about that!

Don't even get me started on Oboro.

I don't know who that is.

Is it pronounced "dice" or "deesay?"

And we can have a category called

"anime character with a singular personality trait and a penchant for violence"

and that's just the one category!

Which PROVES that the Fire Emblem characters are all essentially the same,

and that you cannot differentiate them.

Mission complete!

What was this Unraveled about again?

...Sometimes to two masters!

Patrick: Now Italian.

(Brian in a shitty Italian accent) Ah! That guy is...

oh god I don't know if I can.

Ah that dudes wearing a tight fitting suit with a buncha weird patches it

must be Arlecchino the servant clown sometimesa to two masters!

(Pat and Jenna offscreen laughing)

Brian: Ah I don't know if... Okay.

Pat: We don't have to use it but we need to record it. 
 2020-06-25 16:19:40,122 - DEBUG - file running:  Should auld acquaintance be forgot.

And

all

that

JAZZ.

THAT’S RIGHT FRIENDS it’s Game of the Year season!

Which means it's time for us to hop on those message boards, chat about our favorite games,

and tear out each other’s throats when someone expresses an opinion

that is slightly different from our own.

By this point, pretty much every gaming publication has announced their Game of the Year...

uhh...

which means that I'm a bit late.

Anything that I say is just a drop in the ocean of discourse.

No one wants to hear my opinion.

WHICH IS WHY I AM NOT EXPRESSING AN OPINION.

I AM STATING A FACT.

That’s right, I have devised a statistical, analytical, number-crunching formula

that will SCIENTIFICALLY PROVE

THE GAME OF THE YEAR.

*hype 80s music plays*

They said it couldn’t be done.

A bias-free formula to calculate the game of the year?

That's a fool’s errand, Brian!

You are a fool!

They called me a fool!

But do I look like a fool to you?

I’ve done it, and with the knowledge I have found, I can go ahead and assuage any arguments

you might have with your friends.

There is nothing to debate anymore, there is only the truth, that the best game of the year is...

hidden somewhere, um, in these spreadsheets.

I'm gonna be honest with you, I haven’t...

there are a lot of numbers.

And I haven't had the time to, uh, do them all just yet.

But it’s only December 14th.

This video is set to go up on the 30th, which means I still have two weeks for new games

to come in before I can really call which game is the game of the year.

But I've at least finished the formula, and I’ve tested it on a few to make sure it

runs correctly.

And everyone knows that you can’t get full credit unless you show your work.

So let me show you how I made it.

First thing you gotta do when you're making a GOTY formula is find your list of games.

And obviously we're going to have to choose every single game that was released this year

in order for us to say that it is scientifically accurate.

So if we just go ahead and take a look at Steam and see how many were released since

January 1st 20-hmm.

That's over 15,000.

You can't make me do that, legally.

That's not in my contract.

Right?

I can't... they can't legally make me do that.

Look, as much as video game reviews can be an imperfect reflection of the person who

is writing them, they are still a pretty solid baseline for which video games mattered in our culture.

Even if a review is bad, it still means it was good enough for someone to spend time on it.

So I went Metacritic and I took all the games that were rated 80 or above, and at

the time of writing this script, that was 181 games.

So I'm gonna do the formula for all of those.

Some of these games were DLCs or re-releases onto new platforms.

The Switch alone resurrected about a dozen candidates from years past.

But since they were released this year, they are still technically in the running.

Fight me.

Now that we have the list, it's time to make the formula, and it might surprise you to

hear this, but I have not been in a pure mathematics class in about five years.

So I reached out to some scientists.

And then none of them got back to me.

So I called my old roommate.

“Hey, I’m Nicholas.

I’m a graduate student studying exoplanet atmospheres.”

Nick is working toward a PhD at MIT, and though I was a bit worried about reaching out to

him since his specialization is in astrophysics and not stats about video games,

he assuaged all my fears.

Brian - "Would you say you are a math expert?”

Nick - “No.”

We chatted for about a half an hour, diving deep into the scientific method and the selfless

goals of discovery.

Brian - “If I invent a unit... can I trademark it.”

Nick - “I think your final score should be, like, in Gilberts or whatever.”

Brian - "OK!"

And we finished our chat with the reassurance that this formula was not only going to help

the gaming community, but the scientific community at large.

Brian - “Do you think if I wrote this up, I could get it published in, like, Nature?"

Nick - “No.”

So where to do we go from here now that we have been scientifically rejuvenated?

It's time to build the criteria.

What specifically makes a game of the year?

Number one, what is the game worth?

We're not just talking about monetary worth, we're also talking about the amount of enjoyment

you get while playing the game.

Number two, how them graphics?

We’re trying to find specific numbers associated with these games, and graphics is just a bunch

of numbers anyway, so this will be a useful part.

Number three, how did it affect the cultural miasma?

Look, it’s all about those google results, how many people are talking about the game?

And most importantly, is the game art?

I've figured it out.

Which means that no one has to write any more goddamn thinkpieces about this topic ever again!

Given these four criteria, I sat down with Tara Long, former bioinformatics researcher

and also my current boss.

She and I figured out a formula that will end up with a numerical value that will tell

us the game of the year.

The higher the number, the better the game.

We’ll start with game worth.

Now it’s hard for us to find how worth it a game is to play from a numerical standpoint,

but if you take Metacritic’s score as a percentage of the game you enjoy, and you

multiply that by the average amount of minutes each playthrough takes using the stats from

howlongtobeat.com, then you end up with a number of minutes you have spent enjoying said game.

Now, to tie in material worth, we want to go ahead and take in the original listed price

of the game and divide it by this number so that way we can end up with a DPM: dollars

per minute enjoyed.

Now, it’s hard to decide if you want a high or a low DPM, because some people want the

most bang for their buck, while others are willing to spend a little bit more for a really

well-enjoyed minute.

But just to standardize this, I'm going to assume lower is better — that means you've

paid less per minute you've enjoyed — and that way I can use it to divide literally

the rest of the equation.

HOW BOUT THEM GRAPHICS?

In the past few years, people have cared less and less about how many

polygons you've got on the screen and more about the style.

But one thing that hasn't changed is frame rate.

People want the most frames per second.

So, factually, the more frames, the better.

That means we're going to go ahead and take the highest frame rate available in the game

and we're gonna multiply that by the seconds of average playthrough, again from howlongtobeat.com.

And that will give us the amount of frames per game.

The game frames mainframe.

But how many frames does a gamer game in the gameframe mainframe?

That's a good question.

Now if you go ahead and you take your frames per game and divide it by the number of gamers,

I’m talking about however many copies have been sold or however many number of downloads

there have been, then that's going to leave you with frames per game per gamer, and that’s

a really important number, because if you have 200,000 frames per game and you have

200,000 gamers, that's 200,000 gamers that have only had one frame per game per gamer.

And that is no good, is it?

Is it?

I actually have... um, I'm a little confused now.

We're gonna take frames per game per gamer and we're gonna put it on the top of this

equation, because we want it to be the biggest number possible.

And now it’s time for cultural relevancy.

We want our games of the year to be big and brash and bold and boisterous, letting people

outside of the gaming world know,

Hey!

This is a thing!

So how do we judge a game’s effect on the world at large?

Well, we go ahead and we take all of the Google results that come up when you search

the game's full name and the word game.

But that’s not everything, right?

That's just the bare minimum.

It's like saying, “This dude’s bad haircut is important just because a lot of people are talking about it,”

which I know isn’t true from personal experience.

So I went on twitter and I asked you lovely folks what descriptors you expect to see in

descriptions of games of the year.

And you gave me a lot.

So I went ahead and I plugged all those into Google’s advanced search along with the

game's name, and I took those results and I multiplied it by the base Google search.

And I got very big numbers.

But don't worry, we're going to bring these numbers down to size, because some of the

descriptions you sent in were actually pretty negative descriptions of games.

So I did a Google search using those descriptions, and then I multiplied those results by one

plus the number of Funko Pops made of characters in the game,

which is objectively a terrible thing.

Now this is going to leave you with BCE, or your base cultural effect, and we're gonna

multiply that by our FPGPG in order to get a pretty big number.

But before we’re done with cultural effect, I want you to ask yourself, is this the culture at large?

Does this go outside of our gaming bubble?

There’s really only one way to tell that, and that's by using the M.O.M. variable,

which stands for: "My Own Mother."

So I called my own mother for help.

"Hello, Brian, I'm a follower and a subscriber as well as your mother."

Brian - "That's very good to hear.

I... you support me so well and I appreciate that.

I should ask you, Mom, would you consider yourself a gamer?"

Mom - "When I play Mario Kart with, like, grandchildren and things like that, I always

go off the road."

Brian - "That's, but, on purpose to let them feel better."

Mom - "Very similar to my real-life driving skills, I find."

Brian - "I have a list of 181 video games, now I know that's a lot.

I'm basically gonna run through this, and I'm gonna ask you if you have heard of this game.

Red Dead Redemption 2."

Mom - "No."

Brian - "God of War."

Mom - "Yes!

I have heard of that."

Brian - "Oh, OK!"

While subjecting my mom to a litany of 2018's best games,

it became clear that she was very interested in the topic.

Brian - "We're only 57 in, so we've still got another 130 to go."

Mom - "I can't tell you how, what an exciting time this is for me."

Brian - "Now you get taste of what it's like to do my job."

Mom - "I tell you what, this is a lot of research into things that really have very little meaning."

Brian - "You're right.

It is."

So once I had asked my mom about all of the games from the game of the year list, I was

able to throw it into a boolean function.

If mom knows game equals true, then that’s a plus one here.

And then I could raise our base cultural effect to the power of mom, so if she doesn't know

it, that's just to the power of one.

If she does, that's to the power of two.

Finally, it’s time for our fourth, and perhaps most important criteria: Is this game art?

And when you start asking if something is art, then you really end up asking,

"Why should we even be defining what is and isn't art?"

And the only thing worse than discourse about "are games art?" is

the discourse ABOUT the discourse of "are games art?"

Look, art is experiential and that's a beautiful thing that should be allowed to flourish without

having some pseudoscientific proof of greatness thrust upon it.

Which is why I'm not proving greatness.

Instead, this part of the formula is so revolutionary because I am proving art.

So let's go ahead and throw this into...

Shit, I ran out of space.

You know what, this part wasn't that important.

We're just gonna cut it.

This big GOTY equation ends up with very large numbers, which would be too hard to show all of.

So I needed to make a new unit.

Something I could reduce them all down to.

I plugged in my favorite game of the year, Celeste, and I used that to be our new baseline.

Celeste equals one BDG.

Or Big Determinant of Game.

Everything else will be reduced down using Celeste’s score to a scale of BDGs.

So that's it.

That’s the entire formula.

And if you'll excuse me, I have to go do my dark bidding on these spreadsheets and I will

come back to you right now.

December 30th.

New year is at our doorstep.

Knock knock!

Who’s there?

It’s 2019!

Come on in, hope you're not as big of an asshole as the past few of your friends!

I spent the past two weeks crunching the numbers, and it is my honor to announce that

2018’s scientifically calculated game of the year, with 19...

trillion BDGs...

is Fortnite.

That can't be the right number, I'm gonna...

No, that's right.

You remember when Pluto stopped being a planet, and the scientists were like,

"Hey, that's just what the definitions say!"

And we were like,

"Hey, scientists, maybe your definitions are busted!"

Maybe my formula is busted.

The fact that God of War got 2.1 million BDGs and Red Dead Redemption 2 got 0.1 BDG...

Maybe I shouldn't have made my mom's knowledge of the game an exponential factor.

Brian - "You know Tetris.

You would really like this Tetris..."

Mom - *sings the entire Tetris song*

No, I stand by that decision.

Let’s be honest, the stats I was using definitely favored cultural importance, and Fortnite’s

cultural effect was orders of magnitude larger than any other game this year.

And though I've never played Fortnite

— which proves my lack of bias and also that I’m professionally irresponsible —

there can be no denying that it has made a lasting impact

outside of the video game world.

It’s the only nonseries game that my mom knew about.

And regardless of how you feel about the Fortnite, it drew together a collection of people that

might not have otherwise connected, and that’s a valuable thing.

And even when your Uncle Devin comes up to you at the holiday get together and says,

“HEY BRIAN, WHAT IN THE HECK IS THIS FORTNITE THING?”

it gives you a common ground to chat,

and you really haven't chatted with Uncle Devin in a while.

You should call him more often.

He wants to show you his Civil War books.

And his collection of swords.

But if you’re upset, and you didn’t IMMEDIATELY close this YouTube tab to send me an angry tweet,

I’ve got an extra little gift for you.

It's a new formula.

GOTY equals x times 1 quadrillion.

And x equals your favorite game.

Of this year.

Now you can go ahead and tell your friends that Brian scientifically proved that my favorite game

is the game of the year, and then you can share them this link,

and then they won’t click on it because it’s a 15 minute video, so your secret is safe with me.

And to be honest, your favorite game deserves it,

because if you liked it enough to call it your game of the year,

then it must be pretty meaningful to you,

and no one can take that away.

So congratulations, Fortnite, and congratulations, your favorite game.

Here’s hoping 2019 is full of wonderful games and even more wonderful experiences.

*wink*

Happy New Year.

OH.

OH MY GOD THAT IS SO HOT.

OHHH MY GOD.

IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PROP WATER, PAT.

OH I PROBABLY JUST LIKE RUINED THIS MIC, TOO.

JESUS, PAT.

I TOLD YOU IT WAS PROP WATER.

GOD.

I'm okay.

Mom - "Does enthusiasm count or anything like that?

Should it just be, or just be, just bare bones..."

Brian - "Mom, to be honest, I don't think you can do this not enthusiastically, so,

you're gonna be fine." 
 2020-06-25 16:19:40,122 - DEBUG - file running:  PC gaming is a vast ocean of entertainment,

and if you want to explore, all you have to do is sail out.

And speaking of selling out,

this is my first-ever sponsored video!

That's right, the-

the folks over at Riot have decided to corporately sanction

a video from a man who is best known

for hanging sad clown portraits in his apartment.

You see, they just released VALORANT,

and since I'm currently stuck at home

they were kind enough to give me a budget

to help turbocharge my computer,

so that way I could unravel how to get good at PC gaming.

But the thing about VALORANT

is that you don't need a high-end PC to play it.

Riot told me that even on an old clunker

with minimum specs, you can still play competitively.

And sure enough, I excavated my ancient PC

in order to test this, and it played great.

- It plays great.

Oh, that doesn't count.

So I could use that sponsorship money

to soup up my computer or I could use it

to solve one of PC gaming's biggest problems.

Unlike a console, which can plug into a communal TV,

true PC gaming needs a dedicated space.

I live in a three-bedroom apartment with two other roommates

and they are not gonna be cool with me

setting up my sick rig in the spot where we keep

recycling that we haven't taken out in two weeks.

In fact, the only unused personal space I have

is this four-foot square right next to my radiator.

And I like to keep that block unused

for whenever I wanna feel like a rich person.

- Check me out!

But maybe, with a little help from my sponsor...'s money,

I can turn those 16 square feet into a gamer's paradise.

Today I'm teaching you how to make the perfect gamer space.

(lively dance music)

Oh!

Yeah!

For inspiration, I asked a couple coworkers

what they look for in a PC gaming space.

- Hi, I'm Jeff Ramos.

- I'm Julia.

If there was anyone at Polygon who could lead me

to gamer space perfection it would be Jeff and Julia,

and in our discussions it became clear

that there are four major elements

to a good gaming environment.

The first is a solid foundation.

If I want to build a PC gaming space,

where should I start?

- First, I think you need a computer.

- Check!

But without these other foundational elements,

I'll have less of a gamer space

and more of an ominous obelisk.

From there, you can start embellishing your foundation

with element two, a virtual gaming space,

which is just a fancy way of saying

a place you can stream games from.

- It made me feel a little less lonely

as I'm studying and stuff,

because there's just like a voice.

And I guess I wanted to do that for people, also.

- Streaming for you was less about

getting big and it was more about

sharing an experience with your friends.

- If I got big along the way I would be like, "That's fine."

- Element three is aesthetics.

If you're gonna spend hours at your computer,

at the very least it should be nice to look at,

and it should represent you.

- Everything else at my desk is black.

There's very little decoration, and I like that

'cause it's clear mind, I can just focus

on what I'm doing at any given moment,

versus looking at a desk full of Funko Pops.

- I had, I think, this specific Pop figure

of Vi from "League of Legends."

and then it just kind of expanded.

Since I work from home, too,

I try to make my space fun and engaging.

- And the final element: Caters to bodily needs.

- What type of chair is that that you're sitting in?

- Oh, it's a terrible one and it's going to be replaced.

And it gives me consistent back pain.

- Does that affect your gaming at all?

- If I'm not comfortable, then I'm just thinking,

"Dang, my butt hurts, my back hurts,"

and then I can't pay attention to things.

- Do you ever eat near your computer?

Do you ever have to refuel?

- I try to separate eating from my desk space.

There is a space off to the left where I usually

will always have a coffee cup and a water bottle,

and sometimes there'll be like a snack.

- When you're in the throes of a match,

you don't wanna be worried about your back hurting

or feeling a little famished,

and that means your gamer space should provide

the fuel and comfort your body needs.

If you can amalgamate these four elements,

you'll have a good gamer space.

But I'm making the perfect one.

And how can we prove it's perfect?

An increase in gaming performance!

Ha ha, you thought I wasn't gonna do

what I was sponsored to do!

Get outta here, I'm just killin' two birds with one stone!

My coworkers said in no uncertain terms

that a good gamer space will make me a better gamer.

Once I have a dedicated space,

that's gonna be all I'm gonna need

in order to be proficient at this game?

- Well, you should still practice a little bit, I mean--

- Though I normally don't let little things like rules

stand between me and victory,

"Valorant" has anti-cheat software

that kinda makes that impossible,

so there really is no way for me

to get good at this game without practicing.

But a perfect gamer space will envelop me

in a cocoon of learning,

shutting out the world around me.

By the end of this build, I'll prove

that I've developed a perfect gamer space

by showing just how much better at PC gaming I've become.

Luckily, that's not a very high bar.

That doesn't count.

And with my four elements defined, it was time to start.

I taped out the four-by-four square

and purchased a desk that would fit within the perimeter,

built the desk, got the monitor unpacked,

computer, keyboard, mouse in position,

and we were in business.

Element one, check.

I hopped right into "Valorant," and things were going

way better than with my coffee table setup.

And in hindsight,

maybe I should've stopped there.

But I still had money to burn.

You see, I really was getting better at "Valorant,"

but I had no way of clearly showing

just how well I was doing.

And as Jeff said--

- 'Cause if I no-scope and there's no one around to see it,

then does it matter?

- I ordered a nice microphone and got out my old webcam

to set up my streaming space.

All right, check, check.

We are set to go, everything looks great on the... game.

Things do not look as great...

Although I was prepared to start gaming for the masses,

my room was not.

I can do better than this.

If I go live with this setup,

everyone's gonna make fun of my finger-jointed

builder's-grade garbage molding!

I can't be known as the substandard molding guy.

Luckily, I had two sources of inspiration

for gamer space aesthetics on opposite

sides of the spectrum.

I wanted to land somewhere in the middle.

Obviously, the first step

was installing RGB LEDs, because a gamer space

without constantly changing rainbow lights

is like a little league coach without wraparound Oakleys.

I also purchased a modest number of game figurines,

because even with a sponsor,

hoo boy, those things are expensive.

But at the end of this, my space still felt pretty empty,

so I gathered all the figurines I could find.

All of them.

Beyond this, there was nothing behind me

to brand me as a true gamer for the stream viewers,

so I mocked up a quick poster idea

and sent it over to my coworker Pat

for some illustration work,

and used a little bit more of that sponsor money

to purchase a large cloth banner.

Oh my god.

It's perfect.

Finally, I purchased a video game-themed birthday party set,

and with that my aesthetic was complete.

What's up, y'all!

I am back at it at the streaming setup.

We've got everyone here.

You can tell, as I always say back there,

don't talk to me before I've had my gaming.

I just have a little, there's actually nothing in this cup.

I should probably get something into this cup.

Jeff warned me about keeping snacks off my desk,

but I was worried about getting hangry

in the middle of gaming.

So I prepped some peanut butter toast.

Also, Julia had a specific piece of advice

about emotional needs.

- I have one of the guy from Beastars,

so when I get too mad about playing video games

I can look at him and he'll soothe me.

- Though the sight of an anthropomorphic wolf

isn't necessarily soothing to me,

I do think it's important for me to have something

to calm me down after the rough matches:

Warm milk.

And I still had some sponsorship money left over,

so I purchased myself a gamer chair.

Unfortunately, the only one that could ship in time

was the largest size, which meant

I had to rearrange some furniture.

And with that, the perfect gamer space was complete,

all four elements checked.

The gamer space is created,

and all that's left for me to do

is be the gamer within the space.

I played a few matches, taking a sip from the warm milk

any time I got a little flustered.

But for some reason, I wasn't much better

than when I started this journey.

It's just that my wrists hurt.

That's the only reason why things aren't going great.

Even after running to the drugstore

to pick up some compression braces,

my gaming didn't improve.

It didn't make any sense.

I had spent over a week building this gamer space,

which included dozens of minutes playing VALORANT.

Why wasn't I any better?

The space isn't perfect yet.

That's the only explanation.

I hadn't reached my goal of being a better PC gamer.

But I also hadn't run out of sponsor money.

It was time for a second pass.

My single monitor wasn't giving me

enough screen real estate for what really mattered:

My stream setup.

So I got a second one, and also some nice lights.

We have now upgraded our new space.

I can now see my game, and I can also see

what my stream setup's gonna be.

It's lookin' good.

Enough.

But good enough is never enough

when one is striving for perfection.

The problem with streaming is that most people are okay

with one camera and one game.

I am an auteur who understand the importance

of cilimintography, and if I'm supposed to stream

in a manner that matches my ourverver,

I NEED.

MORE.

CAMERAS.

Sadly, pretty much every webcam is currently sold out.

I was running low on time,

and that's one thing sponsor money can't buy.

But it can buy enterprise level

video conferencing solutions.

Just wanted to check in really quickly

to let you know that

I am unstoppable!

*CACKLING*

- [Roommate] Brian!

- Sorry.

I figured out how to do three cams on OBS,

and now I can play a game.

Which is great, except looking at the overlay,

it's a little busy.

Our little test proved that there were

two big issues with our space.

The first was that the cameras took up most of the screen.

The second is that my roommates didn't enjoy hearing me yell,

which is nothing new.

But that's when it hit me.

I have a plan on how to kill two birds with one stone:

By recycling all of the boxes I've received.

If I could create a soundproof box around my gamer space

and cover it in a green screen,

then I'd have more screen space

and my roommates would stop yelling at me.

So I used more of my sponsorship money

to buy a bunch of expensive studio foam,

and I taped it to a bunch of cardboard.

And then I threw a green screen over the top of it

and viola, a hermetically sealed gamer space.

Now, a few of you might be wondering,

"How does one get into this space?"

But you'll see that right behind my air conditioning unit,

there's a way that I can crawl underneath there.

And the best part about it, it's not even dark

because we've got the... I put in the LEDs!

All I have to do is just weasel my way in.

They say, "No pain, no gain."

And you know, I'm a gamer

"No pame, no game."

Maybe that's better than my current slogan.

Oh, get the head through first,

'cause that's the hardest part of it, you know.

Just kinda like...

being born.

Ah, okay.

Oh.

Do a quick one 180.

And then you swap up, and then you're here.

And then you're in the,

(sighs) and then you're in the gamer space.

As easy as pie.

After a vigorous four-minute entrance,

it was clear that things were working out great.

Check this out!

Look, there's so much I can,

you can see the whole UI.

So there is the problem of these screens.

I spend a lot of time trying to make sure

that I had a cool-looking background.

Such is the curse of the green screen.

Though you can put anything behind it,

sometimes you are left with the void.

I worked so hard to make sure

that my background expressed my gamerhood,

and the gamer box just covered it up.

I wanted to digitally recreate it,

but since I had three cameras it would have to be in 3D.

So I reached out to my coworker Jenna

to mock something up in Blender for me,

based on some previous images I had of my gamer space.

Okay, so we just got the new background set up.

Let's get up in here!

Alrighty, okay.

(grunting) Okay!

I can...

Shit.

(groans) My shirt got caught on a thing.

This was a rude awakening, but a necessary one.

My current clothing setup was not compatible

with the gaming rig, so I figured out a new way

to kill two birds with one stone.

The idea came from my compression braces.

My wrists felt so much better while compressed,

and it made me wonder:

What if all of me was compressed?

So I looked up those tactical black skin suits

that athletes wear in the Olympics,

but I was running dangerously low on time and money

so I had to order from a less-than-scrupulous vendor.

And when it finally arrived it was not to my specifications.

I didn't have any more time.

The deadline was fast approaching.

So I dealt with what I had,

crawled into my sweltering gamer space and--

I see what the problem is now.

My new compression suit was causing me

to dissolve into Jenna's wonderful background.

So I asked her to remodel it,

this time with a 3D photorealistic virtual Brian

that I could superimpose my face onto.

And the worst part of it was that--

And I forgot my snacks!

But in all tribulations there is a chance for greatness,

and greatness was found with a little inspiration,

a little heat exhaustion

and the very last of my sponsorship money.

I'm covered head to toe in this important green screen,

and I don't want this to get marred, obviously.

So what I've come up with,

instead of having to eat toast with my hands,

is that I've purchased

a horse feedbag.

And I was worried about, you know,

my hot milk is gonna start to cool down.

And my computer right now is running a little bit hot, too.

Why don't I just kill two birds with one stone?

There are tons of liquid-cooled computers out there,

and if I use this tubing, I can feed the cool milk

through the PC, cooling it down perfectly,

up around my headset, over the microphone.

Okay, I got my feedbag, which will allow me to eat my snacks

and then I've got my warm milk, which is also

gonna be cooling my computer in the box.

I'll have my snacks and I'll have my box,

and I can stay in there.

With the invention of the milk-cooled PC, patent pending,

and the feedback-sustained me, patent pending,

the perfect gamer space was complete.

Okay.

(grunts) Hello!

Gamers.

I have my feedbag, I tossed it over beforehand.

The crown of it all,

my milk-cooled PC.

(Brian panting)

Let's get gamin'.

Thought the feedbag worked wonders,

I was still doing poorly in my matches.

I was getting flustered and couldn't focus,

but that's nothing a little warm milk couldn't help.

Come on! (groans)

See, I don't get, oh, no no no no no, stop!

No no no, uh, shit!

Shit, shit!

Ah!

Oh, this is bad!

This is very bad!

This is very bad!

After mopping up the MILK MSTR's lactose coolant fluid

and toweling myself off,

I broke out the gaming laptop I borrowed from work

and sat back down in my original VALORANT test position.

And I was better.

Without the lights and the monitors

and the hands-free snacks,

I was gaming better on a coffee table

than in my dedicated space.

So did I screw up

and kill too many birds with too few stones?

Or was I a less than perfect gamer?

Perhaps I was asking a toddler to pilot a helicopter.

There's nothing wrong with

my hot cardboard box of gaming perfection.

I simply was not ready to handle it responsibly.

One day, I will reenter that cocoon

and emerge a wonderful gaming butterfly.

But before I grow my wings,

this little grub must learn to crawl.

And also how to defuse the spike without dying.

It seems impossible.

Has anyone done it yet?

I doubt anyone's done that yet.

That's ridiculous.

(cheery music)

Oh, I'm so dumb.

I screwed it in the wrong way.

- [Karen] I didn't wanna say nothin'.

- You didn't wanna say nothin'?

- [Karen] Well, I looked at it and I knew.

- You looked at it and you knew?

- [Karen] Yeah. (laughs)

- And you didn't say nothin'?

No! 
 2020-06-25 16:19:40,122 - DEBUG - file running:  Kingdom Hearts 3 is finally here.

And I have received an excessive amount of requests to explain the storyline.

That seems perfectly reasonable.

You want to be caught up before you hop into the third game.

But judging by the wording on a few of these requests, it seems like I have a…

TALL TASK

ahead of me.

But could I possibly help you understand the gargantuan, magnificent,

epic storyline of Kingdom Hearts?

You sweet summer child.

You babe swaddled in the cashmere blanket of ignorance.

YOU ASK TOO LITTLE OF ME.

Because not only can I help you understand Kingdom Hearts.

But I will give you the tools necessary to understand any story you are ever faced with

for the rest of your life.

*music plays*

Please, oh baby, don’t go.

~Simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonight.~

*CLAP CLAP*

Spoiler Warning!

I’m about to explain the entirety of the Kingdom Hearts series.

Now, if you don’t want to be spoiled for all of the games released up until now…

I don’t know why you clicked on this video.

Because I feel like the title kinda explained that that’s what I was gonna do.

So that’s on you.

Uh, but ALSO.

Potential spoiler warning!

You see, when I explain the tools of the literary trade, I might just be able to accurately

predict the true ending of Kingdom Hearts 3.

Now, the game hasn’t been released yet, and I have not played it, but…

Consider yourself warned.

We’re talking about the hero’s journey or the monomyth.

This is a concept that’s been around for a long time.

But it was popularized by a guy named Joseph Campbell back in 1949 when he released a book

called The Hero with a Thousand Faces.

Campbell inspired plenty of other creative writers and literary analysts, including a

guy called Christopher Vogler, who wrote his own book in the 1990s.

But before that, in the 1980s, he was working as a story consultant for a little company

called Disney.

When he was there, he sent out a seven-page memo that basically broke down all the big

ideas from Campbell’s book into 12 simple steps to writing good stories.

Did the memo work?

I don’t know.

Why don’t you ask Timon and Pumbaa?

They…

They’re from the Lion King.

That was a movie that Disney Produced.

A lot of people think it’s a great movie.

Kingdom Hearts as described by the monomyth.

We’ve got 12 stages up here, kinda like a clock.

It’s a story wheel.

And I’ll go through piece by piece explaining Kingdom Hearts 1, so that way you can understand

what these stages are.

Once you do understand these stages, you’ll be able to understand any story!

Because great writers, no matter how dense their sci-fi or fantasy world may be, use

these stages to help orient you.

I’m talking Dune.

Harry Potter.

Space Jam.

Number one, introduction in the ordinary world.

In Kingdom Hearts 1, this is when Sora, Riku, and Kairi are all just hanging out on Destiny

Islands, doing normal kid stuff.

Call to adventure.

What’s this?

Weird creatures showing up on the island?

Sora has a sword that’s also a key?

Refusal of the call.

Now we hit a bit of a hiccup here because he really does seem gung-ho to leave the island

at some point.

But I don’t think he wanted to do it on these terms, so I’ll still call this a refusal.

Meeting with the mentor.

At this point Sora is in Traverse Town, and he meets Leon, who ends up giving him some

guidance on what he’s supposed to be doing.

Crossing the threshold.

Or as true literary critics call it…

boarding the gummi ship.

Tests, allies, and enemies.

This is pretty much the entirety of the Disney worlds.

You’ll notice that a lot of times in these synopses of Kingdom Hearts,

people just skip over them.

It’s cause they all fit here.

Reaching the innermost cave.

This is such a pivotal moment in the story.

In Star Wars, this is when Luke goes into the cave and faces off against a shadow version

of himself.

And in Kingdom Hearts, this is when Sora goes into Hollow Bastion so he can fight Riku, who is

actually being possessed by Ansem, who is the Heartless version of Terra-Xehanort, who

was originally Terra but was then possessed by Xehanort before him.

Same thing.

Enduring the supreme ordeal.

After Sora has faced off against Ansem the first time, he has to stab his own heart with

a keyblade, so that way he can release it and save Kairi.

That’s a supreme ordeal.

Seizing the sword.

Now this is not a literal sword.

Obviously, Sora already has one of those.

But instead it’s the reward or the power that Sora can take with him.

So in this case, it’s him being resurrected, having all of the princesses of heart saved,

and having the power to defeat Ansem.

The road back.

Ansem has been defeated by Kingdom Hearts being opened and him being ripped apart by

the light.

And they are able to seal the doors, but unfortunately, they lose two of their friends in the process.

Resurrection.

Yeah, Sora did get literally resurrected a few stages before this.

Uh, but this is more of a metaphysical resurrection.

Them finally coming back from the brink.

Kairi going back to Destiny Islands.

Return with the elixir.

Sora, Donald, and Goofy all go back out, using their combined experience to try to save Mickey

and Riku.

And that's Kingdom Hearts!

That was pretty painless, don't you think?

But granted, that's not what people have an issue with.

People have an issue with all of the overarching story of Kingdom Hearts.

But, again, as long as we stick to these 12 stages, we should be able to take this apart,

piece by piece.

And though I am gonna stick with the 12 stages, I am gonna add just, uh, one little extra piece.

It's called historical background.

This is like The Silmarillion.

Or JK Rowling's twitter.

In Kingdom Hearts, this would be Union Cross, or Chi, or whatever the many names of this

web/mobile game ended up being.

Die-hard fans will get upset with me if I say this doesn't really matter to Sora's overarching story.

But I'm gonna say it anyway.

So this historical background is gonna just be up here.

And all of that knowledge is just gonna kind of bleed immediately into Kingdom Hearts 1.

Pat (offscreen): Uh, nope, you gotta do Birth by Sleep.

Pat: It's a prequel.

Brian: But, is Sora in it?

Pat: No.

No Sora.

Brian: Who's this guy, then?

Pat: That's Vanitas.

Brian: Why?

So I, uh, seem to have neglected, uh, like three other heroes' journeys in this hero's journey.

So I'm just gonna...

I'm gonna move these over a little bit so that way I can have a bit more space.

We, we do have to talk about Birth by Sleep.

Starting first with Terra's.

Um, now imagine it has all twelve of the stages of the hero's journey, I just didn't want

to write 'em all out, 'cause he gets norted, so he's not that good of a hero.

Same goes for Aqua, which is intersecting with Terra's.

And then we've got Ventus, who has the biggest bearing on Sora's hero's journey.

It means that it has to not only intersect over here with Terra and Aqua.

But, I'm sorry Vogler, I am gonna have to include another step on your hero's journey.

So here we've got the Ventus Diagram, uh, which intersects here at step point five.

The part of the hero's journey, uh, where the baby hero's heart goes and saves another boy.

That's the only big change we're gonna do to Vogler's story wheel.

Uh, everything else is gonna make sense in Kingdom Hearts.

And now we're going to take the wheel, uh, as if it is the overarching story of the entirety

of the games.

So Kingdom Hearts, the first one, instead of going from 1 all the way to 12, is actually

just gonna go from 0.5 to 5.

And then we start 5 immediately at Kingdom Hearts 2, which will begin with Sora...

Pat (offscreen): Nope.

Brian: What do you mean nope?

Pat: There's two more.

Once again I seem to have neglected a few, uh, interstitial pieces of Kingdom Hearts.

Chain of Memories and also three five eight days over two.

Which is a totally normal title.

It's totally fine, because it just fleshes out Sora's hero's journey.

And also... a different guy and his name is Roxas.

*pained expression*

I went ahead and I categorized Chain of Memories as a "hero's journey redux"

since Sora is just fighting against his own memories, the things that he has remembered

from the past hero's journey.

So it's just gonna hang out around here.

And then we have 358/2 Days, which follows Roxas, who is Sora's Nobody.

And a Nobody is like the shell of a person after they've released their heart.

358/2 Days happens then, and since it's the hero's Nobody, it's actually within the hero's

journey, doing its own thing.

Um, and, I'm gonna call this 4.5 remix.

This is a pivotal part of the hero's journey when, uh, the hero's shadow self goes off

and eats ice cream.

These two are tied together by a character named Xion, who works in Organization XIII

with Roxas, and also is made from the memories... of Sora.

She doesn't really have like a hero's journey...

I'll just tie it out for you.

And since this oblong actually crosses through the hero's journey twice, we're gonna make

this easy to remember and call it the

"Hero's Memories of the Hero's Journey Double Cross Oblong."

Or HMHJXXO.

In Kingdom Hearts 2, we start out with Roxas and Sora, and Roxas is on summer vacation.

We're gonna have him start over here and just kind of go all the way up to enduring the

supreme ordeal, where he finally gives up his body to Sora so Sora can be whole.

And we're just gonna call that "The Antihero's Cradle."

Alright, so, we're done with Roxas, we're back with Sora.

So this should be a breeze.

Kingdom Hearts 2.

Alright, he's already crossed the threshold.

He does the tests, allies, and enemies.

That's just the Disney stuff, we're gonna skip it.

He goes over, reaches the innermost cave, that would be the World that Never Was, where

he faces off against the supreme ordeal.

Xemnas, Organization XIII.

Seizes the sword.

He gets the power to close Kingdom Hearts.

And then finally, the road back.

They get home.

They get a letter from King Mickey, the contents of which will be revealed in...

Kingdom Hearts 3?

Pat (offscreen): No.

FUCK!

ALRIGHT ASSHOLES.

I have no more space here, so I made you a DATA CUBE.

ARE YA HAPPY?

The data cube contains the entirety of Kingdom Hearts Coded, which is all in a virtual space.

The data cube is that thing where the hero goes on a journey into his inner thoughts

and finds some data that an old guy put in him.

It's that THING THAT HAPPENS IN THE HERO'S JOURNEY.

And then at the same time, we also have Dream Drop Distance, which... is another hero's

journey inside of the hero's journey, and it's part of seizing the sword.

Because they have to go... into sleeping versions of the world's they've already been to.

But also maybe they're... they're going into each other's dreams?

And one of them is...

No, it doesn't fit here, I've got a better...

There's another part of the hero's journey, and it's called the Dream Drop Bucket.

And it's where you put the Dream Drop Distance until you need it later, and hopefully you won't.

That brings us up to Kingdom Hearts 3.

Granted, I thought when I started this, I would be able to...

perfectly predict, uh, Kingdom Hearts 3.

But, I don't know, I feel like I"m just missing something.

*CAUSE He GeTs NOrTEd.*

*BeING POsESSed bY AnSEM.*

*By XeHAnORT.*

*CAUSE HE GETS NORTED.*

I forgot about the villain's journey.

The villain's tridecagon.

The villain's tridecagon is definitely the key.

The tridecagon of villainy.

This is a 13-sided shape that goes one further than dodecagon of the hero's journey.

We have almost entirely ignored Xehanort.

He is the impetus for all of the anger and anguish in Sora's life.

And so he deserves a wheel as well.

We have to start at the very beginning of Xehanort.

And that starts in stage one of all villains.

You have to be contacted by a future version of yourself.

That brings us to stage two.

It gives you the ability to time travel.

And that's what this means.

This special string just shows that they can go wherever they want to in time.

Step three, you need to learn about a great power.

This is when Xehanort first discovers Kingdom Hearts and all of the power it could hold.

What do you do after you find out about that power?

You nort a boy.

Once you've got that boy under your possession, time to get real into unethical science.

That's when you're going to learn all about Kingdom Hearts and how to release people's hearts.

That means you can become a guinea pig yourself, therefore creating two versions of yourself.

A Nobody and a Heartless.

But are you happy with just those two versions of yourself?

You shouldn't be!

'Cause you're a villain.

That's right, it's time for nort boy redux.

Stage eight.

This is when Ansem, the Heartless version of Terra-Xehanort, the original norted boy

form, takes control of Riku.

And now that you're jazzed and ready to go, time to fail.

You do have to fail once, uh, in order to succeed later as a villain.

But don't let that failure get you down, it's time for stage 10.

You develop an organization to trick young boy into committing Heartless genocide in order to create

a new pseudo version of that great power you discovered back in stage three.

And then you fail again.

But guess what!

It's time travel time.

Your young self is gonna help you out by coming from over in step two to step 12.

You just do the same tenth step again, except instead of using other people, you use 13

versions of your own self.

Which leads us to the thirteenth point in the tridecagon.

The villain's variable.

You're either gonna win, or you're gonna lose.

This is the thing that we were missing.

The villain's variable is what will tie together the rest of story.

It's what will help us understand what will happen in Kingdom Hearts 3.

And judging by the villain's tridecagon, I can say that I don't believe Sora will seal

away the darkness.

In fact I expect Xehanort to win...

by norting Sora.

And then think of the repercussions of this.

Donald will kill Goofy by throwing him off a dock.

Riku will start cutting his own bangs.

Kairi will continue to not matter.

It's so much more interesting.

It's the true way that this story should end.

And I think this is what people want.

This is the modern hero's journey.

The true thing that all stories should follow from here on out.

As Utada Hikaru would say: Simple and clean.

So the next time someone tells you, "I don't understand Kingdom Hearts!"

You say, "Hey Bucko.

I think what you don't understand is basic storytelling."

Basic storytelling.

Did that work?

I don't know.

Ask...

Aladdin.

Did the memo work?

Why don't you ask Sebastian the crab. *sings Under the Sea*

You nort a boy.

*laughing*

Pat (offscreen): Ohhh no. 
 2020-06-25 16:19:40,123 - DEBUG - file running:  *cheerful music*

Kirby!

This pink puffball has been sucking his way through the denizens of Dream Land since 1992.

He has his own games, manga, tv series, and toys.

It’s safe to say he’s one of Nintendo’s most trusted mascots.

But he should not be trusted.

The problem with Kirby is that he is simultaneously Nintendo’s simplest and most powerful creature.

Those two realities cannot coexist.

He is a life form with neither the ambition nor the intelligence to make decisions,

and yet the world bends to his will.

Although it appears that Kirby is just a vacuous pastel marshmallow,

there must be some hidden wisdom that grants him the power he wields.

There has to be.

Kirby’s incongruity is terrifying,

but that’s only because we are terrified of things we do not yet understand.

And today, we are going to understand.

"Scientia potentia est.” Knowledge is Power.

Humankind’s attempts to harness the powers of the natural world

come from intense research and understanding of those powers.

And yet Kirby is granted powers well beyond his station.

What powers, you ask? Allow me to show you.

I have created two columns here: Simplicity, and Power.

What Kirby is, versus What Kirby can do.

By mapping the dichotomy of these two columns, we can peel back the facade of Kirby’s simplicity,

and figure out what’s really going on.

Because, again, this is not normal.

Let’s begin with simplicity.

Most people know Kirby as that cute little round guy, but is there more to him?

According to official, canonical information:

no.

Does this sound like an apex predator?

Even a bear enjoys a satisfying back-scratch.

This sounds like the lowest form of life,

someone who is stuck on the base of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs.

He wakes up, eats his caloric intake for the day,

and falls asleep watching The Great British Bake Off.

And yet, over here on the power column...

The things Kirby eats are completely obliterated.

Not just converted into something else, completely gone.

Kirby only cares about eating and sleeping.

And yet, he gains no energy nor pleasure from consuming these things.

Instead, he just lets them disappear.

Gone from this plane of existence.

So…

what the fuck.

Kirby doesn’t speak a language beyond saying the words “Poyo,”

and “Hi!”

Kirby mostly communicates via body language and grunts.

Even toddlers are more communicative.

By all accounts, he is either incapable of, or uninterested in, speaking language.

And yet Kirby is an incredibly skilled technician.

We see Kirby piloting mechs, and if anime is to believed,

and I believe anime,

this can only be accomplished by gifted teens grappling with psychosexual ennui.

He can effortlessly turn himself into a fighter jet,

something that only the most skilled air force engineers have mastered.

How can he understand these complex mechanical processes,

without having the language skill to read a textbook

or the "I fucking love science" facebook page?

Kirby’s origins are vague.

Let me take a moment to move over to a different board so I can show you Kirby’s origin story.

There’s NOTHING HERE.

Very little is known about Kirby’s origin.

He has no canonical species. He has no canonical age.

Masahiro Sakurai, Kirby’s alleged creator,

has stated he does not remember how Kirby got his name.

Kirby was originally a placeholder sprite,

set to be replaced by something....

More!

But no. Kirby survived. Kirby came from nothing.

And Kirby is nothing.

Or is he everything.

Because Kirby can be anything.

His copy ability gives him the powers and appearance of any creature he consumes.

But copy is a misnomer.

He does not duplicate his enemies.

He assimilates and replaces them.

In Smash, he takes the power of his foes, and then the foe is released as a sign of respect.

But in every other iteration of Kirby, the thing he consumes is destroyed in the process.

Does he absorb their DNA? Does he absorb their memories?

Is he the keeper of their souls?

All of these abilities point to Kirby being intelligently designed, which we know is not the case.

Sakurai fucking woke up in a crop circle with the name “Kirby” carved into his arm.

Kirby has no emotional intelligence. No relationships.

In the anime, Kirby seems to harbor no ill will toward King Dedede or Escargoon,

his main two antagonists.

He faces baby birds and full battalions of soldiers with the same vacant grin.

He eats and destroys indiscriminately, but counts no one among his enemies.

But those who count him among theirs…

are cosmic horrors.

Look at this thing.

Look at this thing!

These celestial powers probably have wants and needs far beyond our human comprehension,

and yet they trouble themselves with the destruction of Kirby,

a barely living kickball.

What do they see in Kirby that scares them?

What could scare this?

And the final simple evidence, Kirby is shaped like a friend.

This was the opening of Kirby’s Adventure. Let me show you something.

What did you notice?

That’s right. For the entire time I was drawing this,

I WASN’T INTERROGATING the true nature of Kirby.

This quote is cute and simple and a blatant misdirection.

It is a patronizing errand is meant to keep people like me from uncovering the truth.

The truth that Kirby possesses infinite power.

And that is a quote.

Planet Robobot explicitly states that Kirby possesses infinite power.

Kirby can ride a star. Kirby can punch through a planet.

Kirby is the only being in the entirety of the universe that survived the Galeem cataclysm.

A circle survived.

THIS SURVIVED.

HOW?

*deep breath*

Now that we’ve addressed these two columns, it is time to bridge the gap.

How can we reconcile the two canonical truths of Kirby:

that he is both nothing and everything.

How can this sentient garbage bag accomplish so much?

Let me tell you...

I don’t know.

I literally have no clue how this dumb fucking orb can have so much power.

I have worked my whole life researching and gaining knowledge,

and this dipshit sphere sleeps all day and has powers that gods fear.

And that’s impossible.

It should be impossible.

There has to be an answer here and I don’t see it and that’s NOT FAIR.

If knowledge is power, then power should be knowledge,

and Kirby is everything and he should know everything,

and yet we know nothing!

I can’t think in here.

I’m going outside!

How do I get outside?

Kirby!

The mystery of this florid Dream Landian has baffled me,

but I've taken a few months, and I've collected my thoughts,

and I’m back in the studio to deliver my findings.

Kirby’s incongruity is terrifying, but that’s only because we are terrified of things we do not yet understand.

And today, for real,

we are going to understand.

If you’ll recall from our first exploration of the rosy nightmare,

the problem with Kirby is that he is both incredibly simple and incredibly powerful.

In the intervening five months, I’ve learned a few pieces of information that contradict a few of my points.

First, Kirby can speak a language.

There was a Drama CD released in Japan in 1994 where Kirby speaks full sentences.

But in this, he says that a phone is “mysterious” and he doesn’t know how it works.

And yet, he can pilot a mech.

Two, Kirby’s name does in fact have a backstory,

even if Sakurai was too fuckin' zooted to remember it.

Kirby was named after John Kirby, a lawyer who passed away last year,

who defended Nintendo’s right to copyright Donkey Kong back in the ‘80s.

But this doesn’t make the rest of Kirby's origin any less vague,

and it doesn't change the fact that a creature cannot possibly embody both of these truths.

But that’s the problem.

I’ve been thinking of Kirby as a creature.

Consider, for a moment, Moby Dick.

You might receive this book in your English class and say,

"Hell yeah! A big ol’ whale?

I can’t wait to see Ahab level up and hit that big boy right in his weak points.

And sure, he puts his harpoon up in Moby D’s flanks,

but spoiler alert!

Ahab gets got,

even though he’s been grinding for, like, years

and Pale Whale's just a dipshit fish with a thing for sailor feet.

And so you say this to Ms. Mahoney and she’s like,

“Brian, don’t you get it? The whale is a metaphor for…

something,”

and then you write that on your final exam and you pass the class.

This is what I like to call “The Bookman’s Bluff.”

It’s when an author creates something, and people are like,

“Hey, that doesn’t make sense,”

but then the author says,

“Well, it does make sense if you consider it’s actually a metaphor.”

Here, I believe that Sakurai is pulling a Bookman’s Bluff.

Kirby, like Moby Dick, doesn’t make sense as a creature,

but he will make sense as a metaphor.

So what does Kirby symbolize?

Let’s take a look at some common metaphors.

Let's start with the seven deadly sins since everyone and their mother is basing characters on them.

Unfortunately, none of them really make sense for Kirby.

Wrath, no way. Greed, he’s not in it for the money.

I'm gonna skip over lust.

You could make an argument for Gluttony because he eats a lot.

Sloth, he sleeps a lot. And Envy, he's constantly copying other people.

But he never does it with any malice. Kirby does these things haphazardly,

without any sense of what he's doing.

And then there’s Pride.

Now, pride is the sin from which all other sins arise,

and its punishment in hell is being broken upon the wheel,

but Kirby is a wheel, so that ain’t gonna work.

But Kirby might symbolize someone else’s pride...

The Hubris of Humanity.

Think about it.

Has humanity ever paused to consider that perhaps our endless consumption

may not be a good move for the world as a whole?

Have we altered our course or simply continued to eat and sleep and copy others

without any thought of the repercussions?

In fact, perhaps we can go one step further. Kirby is a metaphor for capitalism!

Does our capitalist society assimilate and destroy?

Absolutely!

Technical and cultural appropriation are two of capitalism’s most trusted tools.

When it comes to a lack of emotional intelligence,

capitalism makes people willing to suck in and obliterate anything,

friend or foe, nation or natural wonder, so long as it makes money.

Is capitalism’s enemy a cosmic horror?

What could be more cosmically horrifying to a capitalist society

than a guy called Marx.

KIRBY IS A METAPHOR FOR CAPITALISM.

Sure, capitalism can sometimes be more cruel in its intentions than Kirby can manage.

That is... I'll take that.

Uh, also, it sure as hell feels like it could burn out at any second,

so the infinite power thing: not 100% true.

Um, and,

very-it's a-it’s hard to describe capitalism as being shaped like a friend…

and the whole eating and sleeping only is...

it doesn’t really make sense 'cause we have a hyper fixation on productivity and that being tied to worth…

so that doesn't...

This is not a very good metaphor, is it?

In fact, most of these metaphors are bullshit.

Especially this one.

I thought I could take five months and pause and contemplate,

and then I'd come back, and I'd have the perfect explanation for the dichotomy of Kirby,

but nothing has changed.

This horrifying bolus slips through my fingers again.

Maybe I’m just not good at this...

Jenna, can you...

I need you to keep my papers and push pins safe. I’m gonna go away for awhile…

I'm gonna find Kirby.

Jenna: Okay. Good luck bud.

I went to the woods because I wished to front only the essential facts of Kirby.

I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life,

just as Kirby might suck a Waddle Dee into his gullet.

I’ve been at it for a while now.

Judging by the length of my beard, I’ve been living out here for 2, maybe 3 years?

There are no pin boards in the forest.

I don’t have three cameras to catch my every side glance.

They don't teach you th...

It’s just me. And nature,

which has reduced me to my base instincts.

I only care about finding food and shelter,

eating and sleeping.

I am become Kirby.

I wish I could say this has given me a clear mind, but no,

nature has broken me.

I am confounded by it.

And we are terrified of things we do not yet understand.

Kirby is nature!

...I thought, after spending my first day out in the woods.

Sure, nature’s origins are still murky,

and what is evolution if not a really, really slow form of Kirby’s copy ability?

*inhaling*

And much like Kirby, Nature is neither cruel nor kind:

it doles out boons and punishments indiscriminately.

For every delicious handful of berries,

it also gives a completely unrelated bout of diarrhea.

But it took me only a few days to realize that this was another dead end.

Nature doesn’t destroy matter, or possess infinite power,

and its enemy is not a cosmic horror,

it’s us.

I'm sorry for using so much paper.

So I went back to the proverbial drawing board and have been stuck there ever since.

Nature is still terrifying to me.

And it is certainly not shaped like a friend.

How can Kirby live like this and stay so joyful?

How can he only care about his base needs and conquer any enemies that come before him?

I can’t conquer anything,

not even the mystery of a character from a children’s game.

All I can do is tumble listlessly through the wood,

like a star spat from Kirby’s maw.

*waves crashing*

I awake one morning upon the shore of a strange sea.

I do not know where I am, nor how I came to be here.

The sea stretches endlessly in front of me,

revealing the gentle, Kirby-like curve of the planet,

and I finally understand.

I was so focused on investigating the inner machinations of this bulbous boy

that I never asked why I was investigating.

I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things to mean something,

but Kirby didn’t need an explanation,

I did.

There is no bullet point or fan wiki entry.

Kirby is not nature or a metaphor.

Kirby doesn’t need a dark backstory or a logical rationale.

Kirby is just Kirby.

As I stand here watching the waves lap against the sand

miles away from civilization,

I realize I’m not simply standing on the edge of the ocean, but the edge of the world.

A world I’ve accepted without knowing its hidden meaning.

Perhaps there is no hidden meaning.

Perhaps it’s better that way.

Perhaps it’s time for me to go home.

“First you draw a circle,

then you dot the eyes.

Add a great big smile,

and presto, it’s Kirby.”

Kirby is an extremely strong circle,

and that’s all the explanation I need.

Unfortunately,

the same CANNOT BE SAID FOR DIDDY KONG.

WHO GAVE HIM A GUN? DID HE BUILD THE JETPACK?

THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE, HE'S A MONKEY, WHAT IS HE...

*suit ripping* Ahhh yeah!

This is satisfying. If you get in on this, you want to...

Pat: Yeah.

Brian: Roll... just put that in a bunch of dirt right now.

I'm gonna roll around a little bit.

*you hear a bunch of scrounging around*

*shirt ripping* Brian: Ohhhh incredible!

Pat: Are we gonna ride on the train like this to Coney Island?

Brian: Yeah maybe! 
 2020-06-25 16:19:40,123 - DEBUG - file running:  Mario!

He can jump, he can dance,

and he can successfully avoid conviction for war crimes.

It seems like the only thing he can’t do is settle down and just enjoy life for a bit.

Mario has been cleaning up messes in the Mushroom Kingdom and beyond since 1981.

That makes him almost 40 years old.

Most 40-year-olds I know are paying off a mortgage, buying a Peloton,

and desperately trying not to become their parents.

But Mario is still out there,

grinding at the same job,

and also, every other job.

Doesn’t Mario deserve some time off?

Doesn’t he get a chance to kick up his heels?

Enjoy a tropical drink while visiting the ol’ timeshare?

And more specifically, hasn’t he made enough coins to let him coast for the rest of his life?

That’s why I’m here to give him a little financial advice…

*ding!*

And figure out when Mario can retire.

*chalk board wheeling in*

Thank you both.

Why should Mario retire?

You might say “Mario loves his job,

and when you love what you do, you never work a day in your life,”

but that's bullshit.

I love what I do, and let me tell you something…

I’ve worked some days.

*threatening bass noise*

I personally can’t wait to retire.

As soon as I hit 50, I'm gonna be out there on the beach,

pina colada in one hand, sci-fi novel in the other,

soaking up mother nature's cosmic rays.

But Mario has a history of risk-taking behavior, and

it's possible he's planning to live fast, die young, and leave a beautiful, beautiful corpse.

That said, he’s made it out of every scrape so far,

and ground pounding at age 86 is hard on the hips.

Mario needs a backup plan.

Now, I’m not here to tell Mario how to live his life

*ding*

but I can take a look at his finances

and figure out when he’ll have enough money to finally hand Peach his resignation letter.

Foolish ol’ me thought that I could just google “how much money do you need to retire”

and there'd be a link that says “a million bucks,”

but no.

Turns out that everyone needs a different amount to retire based on what you’re used to.

If you’re making millions every year, you’re gonna need a lot more to retire,

because how else are you gonna support your dipshit failson’s bad business ideas?

But with all of the retirement calculators online, I was getting a little overwhelmed,

so I decided to reach out to a qualified financial advisor.

- Hi, my name’s Nate Choe, I’m a certified financial planner with Northwestern Mutual,

and I basically help people answer questions about money.

- That’s exactly what I need you to do today.

This call is not about me, um, I feel like I’m in a great spot right now in terms of my finances,

but I have some worries about my good friend, Mario.

I was looking online to see if there was, like, just a number of money you need in order to retire,

and it turns out that that’s not a thing that exists.

How do I figure out how much money you need to retire?

- Yeah, yeah, um, there are a lot of different things that you’d need to know.

At the most basic level, you need to know how many years you’re going to spend in retirement.

So basically, when you’re gonna retire, and at what age you’re going to die.

- So I have know, I have to be able to, uh,

to just discern when I’m willing to croak, is what you’re saying.

- Exactly, yes, you have to calculate a death at some point.

- Alright. What if I’m never gonna die.

- *chuckling* Then you’re never going to be able to retire.

And then you’ll need to know how much money you’re going to spend every single month…

- Okay…

- And then Nate listed off a bunch of other very important pieces of retirement info

and I paid close attention.

- Got it, okay.

I figure out how much money he’s gonna need per month, and then I’ll work backward from that,

based on how much money he can accrue, and then that will be how I can figure out when he can retire?

- That work backwards model is actually what we do in the industry,

but we have to offset what he has against inflation as well.

- Is there a minimum amount of money per month that you suggest people have for retirement?

- Yeah, typically, what we’re talking about, like, the average American,

it’s going to be about three thousand dollars a month, of today’s dollars.

- I feel like Mario is a very humble man,

and so I don’t think he’s going to need more than 3k a month, um,

just to make it easier for me.

So now that I’ve got a basic gist of the information I need to calculate Mario’s retirement age,

it’s time to collect the information.

Let’s start with something easygoing

and figure out when Mario's gonna die.

To keep things simple, we’ll assume that Mario was born the year he first made a game appearance.

This might not be perfectly accurate, but it would make him almost 39 years old,

and that feels pretty right for a strangely smooth-skinned mustachioed man.

Though current male life expectancy is around 80 years old,

I personally can’t come to grips with the fact that Mario is halfway through his life,

so I’ll be generous and say he’ll die at 90.

He’s spry.

In order to retire, Mario is going to need a monthly budget of at least three thousand US dollars,

but he uses coins.

Tons and tons of people have tried to figure out, how much a coin would be worth in US dollars,

but most of them have been thinking about coins as a solid gold object.

Judging by the amount of coins you need to purchase simple objects in the Mushroom Kingdom,

it seems like coins are not really worth that much.

Using Super Mario RPG as our guideline for a coin’s purchasing power,

the cheapest items are a mushroom and able juice: 4 coins a pop.

Shirt and pants are the cheapest nonconsumable items at 7 coins each.

I wanted to compare these with the most expensive items in Super Mario RPG,

but I don’t think I can figure out the real world price of a fire bomb

without getting put on a watch list.

After doing some heavy research, I settled on a conversion rate of 1 coin to 8 US Dollars.

Given our 3k figure for retirement,

that just means Mario needs 375 coins a month, right?

WRONG.

Super Mario RPG came out in 1996, and we haven’t accounted for inflation.

That’s why we gotta compare these prices to similar items Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga,

which came out seven years later.

I built my Mushroom Price Index on these six items, and just from a cursory glance,

it’s obvious that the prices have gone up.

But to figure out by how much, we gotta head back to algebra two.

The pert equation!

It's something I learned about a very long time ago,

and I’m pretty sure it’s used to figure out compounding interest.

Basically, I gotta plug in some prices and do some natural logs and

whatever else the internet tells me to do,

and it will leave me with an annual inflation rate for that item.

Then I just gotta average out the rates and it’ll leave me with a workable annual inflation rate

for the Mushroom Kingdom as a whole.

So I’ll just go ahead and do that math in my head real quick.

*thinking music*

Thank you, Clayton.

Now, rounding that number up, that’s an average annual inflation rate of about 15% per year.

Which is… really high.

The US Federal Reserve tries to keep inflation at a healthy 2%,

whereas the Mushroom Kingdom Federal Reserve doesn’t exist

due to aggressive lobbying by Wario.

In order to understand this a bit better, I googled Mario hyperinflation,

and I got some exciting search results

that were ultimately unhelpful.

But from what I gather, this means that if Mario spends 100 coins to buy a shirt this year,

next year, he'll have to spend a little more than 115 for the same shirt.

If inflation stayed the same from when Superstar Saga came out in 2003,

we can assume that by 2020, a simple mushroom is going to cost 128 coins.

A pair of entry level pants will cost 2049 coins.

So that original 1-to-8 conversion rate doesn’t really make sense anymore.

Using those same 2020 price comparisons,

the conversion rate is more like 36 coins to 1 US Dollar.

If Mario retired today, he would need 108,000 coins per month.

*MAMMA MIA!*

But let’s remember that Mario has been doing this for a long time. He’s definitely got a little something...

... away. So I talked to Nate about his job and ways he might be saving money.

- He has a bit of a strange job. He’s technically a plumber, I guess, in title?

- Is he part of, like, the plumber’s union? Does he have a pension?

- So I, I, I would be willing to bet he doesn’t have a pension just because, uh,

I think he might be the only plumber?

He’s not being employed by anyone, necessarily. He’s just doing it and then finding his payment along the way.

- Okay, so it sounds like he’s almost, like, a freelancer.

If he’s not getting W-2 income he can’t save into things like 401ks or Roth IRAs.

- Now, when you say Roth IRA, what is that?

- It’s a way to save for retirement.

Um,

you know, as a young person you should definitely be doing one, trying to max it out every single year.

It’s crucial for, for retirement.

- When…

But when you say crucial, do you…

do you mean optional?

So, maybe Mario doesn’t have a Rough IRA or a 4-in-1 Cake or whatever,

but no one has those. I don’t, and I’m well on my way to that beach chair in Boca!

And the fact is that Mario can get a lot of coins in his games.

How else could he spend so much on go-karting and tennis?

In the most recent Mario games, the coin counter can only go up to 9,999,

which is the maximum amount you can store in a mattress.

So let’s assume that Mario has been saving 10,000 coins every year since the release of Mario Odyssey.

We can assume that since he’s not in a union, he isn’t getting any raises to offset inflation.

So to finally figure out when Mario can retire, we need to know much money he’ll need every year before his death.

For example, if he lives to 90 years old, he’ll need 2.7 billion coins.

Which is the cost of living for just one year.

But we have to remember that he's been saving 10,000 coins for 54 years,

which means that he would have 540 thousand coins saved up… Which is…

point zero two percent

of what he needs to retire for just one year before his death.

And actually, if the monthly cost of living is already 108 thousand coins,

he's gonna be unbelievably deep in debt…

Which is actually what Nate told me, via text.

Mario can never retire.

You know what, that’s bonkers though, because there's...

there’s no way that, you know, inflation's gonna stay that high for that long.

In fact, in later Mario and Luigi RPGs, the prices are the same or lower.

So let’s just assume that from here on out the inflation rate stays a healthy 2%.

And you know what, let’s assume that Mario can save more than 10,000 coins a month.

In New Super Mario Bros. 2, the counter maxes out at one less than 10 million coins.

Granted, this is an outlier, and a ridiculous one at that,

but so is spending 2.7 billion coins just to survive at age 90.

There’s no way you could spend that much on Werther’s Originals.

So let’s say he's saving 10 million coins a year since age 31,

which, might I point out, is over a quarter of a million US Dollars.

Now if we just add up the cost of living of each year leading up to 90,

we can see that Mario will have saved enough money to chill out on his boat at age…

77.

Which is...

is just one year below the average American male life expectancy…

*I'M-A TIRED!*

Okay, you know what,

just for fun, let's just throw some random numbers in here, just to... just for...

just to see, you know, just wheaa- just for fun!

Let’s say Mario is starting to save money at, ppffff, I don’t know, my age, 26.

The inflation rate can stay the same, 2%,

and let's just say that the coin ratio is actually just 1-to-1 with US dollars,

so just he needs 3,000 coins today in order to retire.

And, and you know what, let’s, let's say he can save….

uhhh, psshhh, 10% of an average video producer’s salary in New York City.

Something completely random like that.

Assuming Mario lives to the ripe old age of 90,

we can just plug these figures into the equation

and figure out that Mario will be kickin' back on the white sands,

boombox blastin' Jimmy Buffett at the youthful retirement age of...

88?

Are you fucking kidding me?

Nononono... That can’t be right…

Because if Mario can’t retire,

then that would mean that I wo-

*uncomfortable silence*

Will you excuse me for a moment…

*tropical music playing in the background*

*Another day in paradise!*

*The sun is shining bright!*

*People laugh and people smile, 'cause everything feels alright!*

In order to understand this a little better, I googled Mario hyperinfla- *laughing* I just,

I'm sorry, I'm just accepting this now. I'm just accepting what I'm saying. 
 2020-06-25 16:19:40,123 - DEBUG - file running:  The Mega Man robot masters were not always evil.

In fact, most were mechanized workers, created specifically to make life on Earth more efficient

and wonderful.

AND THEN THAT MASSIVE DONGER,

DR. WILY, TURNED ‘EM ON US!

So Mega Man destroyed them, and the world was saved.

But... just how useful were these robots?

And were they useful enough to chance a robot uprising?

What if someone ranked every single Mega Man robot master from most to least useful to

see which ones were really worth the risk.

Someone should try to do that.

It’s me.

I’m the one who’s going to do that.

Before I get started on the gradient of worth it to not worth it, I’m gonna talk

about the protagonists, or “the good guys” even though some of them aren’t specifically good.

A lot of these robots were built to be sentient for the sake of being sentient, and I do not

feel at all qualified to discuss the philosophical implications of that.

So I’m gonna put ‘em over here.

Mega Man.

Mega Man X.

Mega Man red.

They’re all over here.

I’m not gonna touch that.

So what kind of robots are good when they’re sentient?

I think that it’s things humans cannot do.

Things that perhaps only a robot could do.

One that can think for itself would be pretty worthwhile.

So let’s start with those ones.

The ones that are good.

Number one: Chill Man.

Chill Man is a recent robot master who was built to help stop global warming.

And heaven knows we need that.

Definitely worthwhile.

Next is another cold friend: Freeze Man.

Freeze Man was built to make a non-polluting energy.

He would make that energy by splitting average temperatures

into hot temperatures and cold temperatures.

I’m choosing to think of that as something like nuclear fission as opposed to choosing

to think of it as dumb.

Commando Man.

Terrible name, but he was actually a minesweeping robot.

One of the first gens, Elec Man.

He controlled nuclear power plants.

He could help make sure the nuclear power plant was shut down in case anything bad ever

happened to one.

Hopefully it won’t!

SsssssSTAR MAN!

He was built to explore the universe.

Humans are real squishy, really, when you think about it.

It might be nice to have a man going out into the stars, a Star Man.

Also in his flavor text, he’s apparently a romantic and, like, loves poetry, and that’s

what we need out in the stars.

While he’s up there, Galaxy Man is helping figure out the trajectories.

Splash Woman!

She’s super useful because she goes and helps shipwrecked sailors, or just people

lost at sea.

I feel like she’d do a better job than, I dunno, the Coast Guard or whatever.

Not that I’m shitting on the Coast Guard.

They do do good…

I’m digging myself in a hole.

Wait, where’d Toad Man go?

*worry about Toad Man*

Where’s my guy Toad Man?

Toad Man.

He irrigates crops during drought.

Very useful.

Why’d they make him a toad?

Ice Man.

I swear we’ve got a lot of cold people up here at the front.

He’s built specifically to do human-like tasks in cold weather.

So he’s good!

More cold friends.

Blizzard Man.

There to help monitor the weather in arctic environments.

Looks and names can be deceiving, and Junk Man is super important.

Junk Man was built so he could find useable robot parts that have been left out.

Think about how much electronic waste we make.

It would be great if something could go dig through all of our trash and find the useable

circuit boards.

That’s important.

Hornet Man.

We’ve done some shit to bees y’all.

He pollinates the flowers.

Would be very useful if we continue to keep doing shit to bees.

And finally, we’ve got Cloud Man and Tornado Man.

They both are actually useful for, uh, controlling the weather when things are bad.

I’m gonna put Cloud Man in front of Tornado Man because Tornado Man, uh, was, was built

to stop tropical storms.

Which is not what a tornado is.

He needs a different name.

There we go.

These ones I would say are worth the risk.

We still have like 180 more to go.

We got a bunch of construction robots next.

We’ll start with everyone’s favorite: Guts Man.

Imagine there’s a line right here.

Maybe I’ll put it in in after effects.

That might be too much work.

I’m probably not gonna do that.

Good ones.

Now we’re into construction zone.

Guts Man comes first because he’s a civil engineer.

He’s not only strong and can lift big rocks, but he can build bridges probably.

We’ve got Aqua Man and Pump Man.

Both of them are used for water filtration.

I’m gonna put Aqua Man in front of Pump Man because Pump Man’s flavor text explains

that sometimes he’ll volunteer to wash off graffiti,

and no one likes a narc.

Bomb Man: bombs.

Ground Man: excavation.

Block Man: makes blocks.

Concrete Man: concrete.

Needle Man: needles.

I guess it’s drilling.

Drill Man: also drilling.

Bit Man, from the DOS game.

He is also a driller.

You think that after the first two went bad… they would’ve stopped making drill robots,

right?

Oil Man DOS.

He does oil… things.

Hard Man.

*trying to keep it together*

He doesn’t actually have a, um, flavor text explanation for what he is other than that

he is very heavy.

So I am assuming that he is for ground leveling.

Um.

But maybe he’s just big?

Impact Man: piling.

Cut Man: tree cutting.

Torch Man DOS: welding.

Fuse Man: electrical equipment management.

Oil Man: keeping things oiled.

Spark Man: making sparks!

I think he actually charges things.

Fire Man.

He was made to incinerate trash.

Bond Man.

He was supposed to be in the first game until they realized… he was just glue.

Stone Man.

I assume bricks, but actually they only say that he hangs out with Guts Man, so maybe

he’s just moral support.

Flame Man.

He generates thermal power.

But also he’s powered by thermal power?

Which seems recursive.

And also impossible.

Jewel Man.

He not only mines the jewels but he polishes them.

Finally, in the construction, it’s Slash Man.

He was specifically made to cut down trees so that you could build SECRET bases.

I don’t know why they insisted on saying it was for secret bases.

That seems like a waste of a robot.

To be perfectly honest, I don’t think we needed to make these ones sentient, because

you know what, Hard Man?

I think steamrollers were doing just fine.

Now we’re getting into a category I like to call…

Sure???

They’re not necessarily bad.

I just think we could probably do without Wind Man, who apparently helps with the harvest…

with fans.

Astro Man, who just works in a planetarium.

Gravity Man.

He can control gravity which could be useful?

Dive Man.

He was built to catch fish with torpedoes.

They made him look like a submarine and they gave him torpedoes.

Feel like they should’ve seen this coming.

Solar Man.

Now he investigates solar things, I guess.

He also apparently developed an exercise routine.

I don’t know why they needed to put that in the flavor text, but it definitely put

him in the “Sure???” category.

Top Man.

I’ll give ya…

I’ll give you a guess about what he does.

Did you guess “explore other planets?”

Because yeah, that’s what he was designed for.

Why the FUCK is he a top?

God these are all so good.

We’re getting into the categories where I can’t stop laugh…

*clears throat* *deep breath*

Serious.

Snake Man.

*laughter from everyone in the studio*

He, uh, was supposed to explore other planets

that had crevasses.

And he’s a snake.

Gyro Man.

He was supposed to be a really good plane, but then Wily ran out of money, so they just

stuck a propellor on his back.

Plant Man manages plants.

Pharaoh Man.

Only supposed to explore ruins.

Blast Man.

He manages fireworks.

Fireworks are dangerous.

Don’t play with fireworks.

But also, maybe, don’t make a robot to play with them.

I love Nitro Man.

I’m gonna be honest, I do feel kind of bad putting him into the “Sure???” category.

Uh, because Nitro Man was built specifically to do motorcycle stunts in movies.

The thing I really love about Nitro Man is that he’s the president of a stunt robot club.

Which I think is just wonderful.

He’s still not useful.

Here’s where thing get a little bit difficult for me.

Burst Man was built to be a guard.

I’m not sure about robot, highly armed guards.

But since he was specifically a guard…

I keep saying specifically.

I figure, like, that’s still defensive, and so…

I’ll put him here.

But it’s a good segue!

In the Mega Man games, not every robot was made by Dr. Wily or Dr. Light.

And in fact, there were some robots that were made by other robots.

Or were made extraterrestrially.

Or were made specifically as a joke, like “I can’t find my keys, man!”

I’m gonna put them kind of as the split in the middle to say, “Hey, these are nebulous,

but they’re definitely not good.”

Now that we’ve got this hard line of good to bad, even though, to be honest, I think

that the line should be here.

It’s time for us to talk about the bad robots.

J.J. Abrams.

Some of these robots were built specifically to murder.

We can all agree that that is bad.

I’m gonna put all of these murder robots over on the very bad side.

We also have a bunch of characters that are Sonic robots.

That is an affront to nature.

They’re in the bad side, too.

I also didn’t even print out all of the NetNavis from Mega Man Battle Network even

though I love those games because those were software built with the specific intention

of being mean online.

And that’s just Twitter.

I do just want to point out Aircon Man, who was a robot sent from the future to destroy

the world.

And he’s also an air conditioning unit.

Now *kick* let’s get into the fun part.

These robots have absolutely no reason to be sentient.

Chemistry Man.

He’s from the new cartoon.

He apparently taught chemistry classes that were so boring, he put kids to sleep.

And then he took it really personally, and decided to become evil.

Sheep Man.

He’s a shepard actually.

Tundra Man.

Built to do similar things to all of the high echelon frozen people, but I’m including

him over here because he got really bored at his job and then decided to become

an ice skater.

This is why you don’t make sentient robots, I guess.

Hypno Woman.

She was a therapist who hypnotized people into bad things.

DJ Jazzy J4-8950…

is a boombox.

You are a magnet.

Plug Man charged electrical things.

Like a plug could do.

Strike Man sounds cool, but he’s just a baseball throwing machine.

It’s me.

Spring Man can… jump?

Bright Man.

Built to explore dark places.

Kinda like a FLASHLIGHT.

Cold Man’s a refrigerator.

Seriously.

Sword Man.

He was developed to hold a sword that Wily stole from a place.

He’s not a sentient murder robot.

He’s a sentient picture frame.

Things that don’t really need to be sentient?

A vacuum.

It’s Dust Man.

Although, Dust Man is quoted as saying, “Don’t let me suck more than I can handle!”

So you know what, actually, I take this back.

He’s more important than Chill Man.

We’ve already done the worthwhile ones.

We’ve talked about the construction ones.

We’ve talked about the ones that are “eh whaat uh sure w-okay thas fine.”

We have all of the ones that are alien.

And we’ve got the ones that really didn’t need to be sentient.

We are left with the dregs of robotic society.

I call this category…

NO.

We’ll start with Crystal Man.

He was built to make crystals so that Dr. Wily could sell them for money.

Turbo Man is a car.

Or rather, he used to be a car, but then he was turned into turbo man.

Charge Man.

Is he a train?

No.

But he’s meant to camouflage as one.

I think Dr. Wily’s just real into trains.

You know what I think about when I think of “Safety Operations Manager?”

A big man full of magma.

Built to make sure a plant kept safe, but also had a bunch of cauldrons full of boiling

magma in him.

Time Man.

He’s a time machine.

That never goes well.

Acid Man was built to be a chemist.

What’s he good for, titrations?

That's a chemistry joke.

Centaur Man.

He... was a tour guide.

Just hire a 16 year old.

Like, they need the job.

Shark Man DOS.

Shark Man DOS not need to exist.

Oh we’ve been doing this for like five hours.

*CLAP CLAP*

Goddamnit.

Magic Man was built to be a magician in like a traveling circus sort of show.

And then he was not turned evil, he just decided to conscript in King’s army because he wanted

to show off.

Here’s the big rule of thumb:

magicians are always evil.

Shade Man.

He looks like a vampire, doesn’t he?

It’s ‘cause he was built to look like one.

He was an animatronic robot in a haunted house.

Somebody thought we should make that creepy animatronic robot sentient.

PHEW remember how Centaur Man was a tour guide?

Well so was Dynamo Man.

But they also made him constantly shoot off electricity.

That’s a bad tour guide.

When they got into, like, the late game stages, they were just like, “I dunno, he’s a

tour guide for a thing.”

Torch Man was built to teach kids about fire safety in the woods.

Which is kind of like if Smokey the Bear

was CONSTANTLY ON FIRE.

You thought torch man was bad, let me tell ya about Burner Man, who was made, and I quote,

“to bring harm to natural environments.”

Technically not murder.

Definitely bad.

Remember how I said that a lot of these guys were tour guides?

Well let me tell you about Blade Man.

Built to show off an old castle full of swords.

And also was a sword.

Tengu Man.

Makes typhoons.

HOOOKAY.

We’re at the final three here.

We’ve made it.

And I’d say that these three really hammer home the point

that we should not be making sentient robots.

We’ve got Pirate Man.

Not a murder robot.

But was built to do pirate things, like steal from other ships.

He does look cool as hell, though.

The second to last robot is not actually a terrible robot idea.

But it is a testament to just how trash human beings are.

Bounce Man was built to be a crash test dummy.

Some asshole thought, “Hey, you know that thing we throw against a wall,

many miles-per-hour,

every single day,

multiple times a day?

You know what would make that better?

IF IT COULD FEEL PAIN.”

WHAT?

Luckily, Bounce Man bounced from that job and then became an exercise instructor.

Humans are trash.

Finally, we’ve come to number one.

Clown Man.

Who has ever watched a clown and thought to themselves,

“Boy,

I wish that thing never got tired!"

Clown Man is terrible, and I’m not saying that clowns are terrible.

Okay?

Clowns serve their purpose.

They’re creepy.

Sometimes good.

And…

You know what, I do take that back, clowns don’t serve a purpose.

That’s it.

All 200+ Mega Man robot masters, of which 15 are kind of okay.

Elon Musk: don’t get any ideas.

This is what man has wrought.

You will see these men in your nightmares.

Particularly,

Spring Man.

Jumping around.

 2020-06-25 16:19:40,124 - DEBUG - file running:  Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.

A game that takes heroic and villainous characters and forces them to form fraternal bonds in

the crucible of battle.

Because for those who can superbly smash, there is no better place to make a friend

than on the battlefield.

That’s the battlefield?

Seriously?

How did they get permits for that?

That’s irresponsible.

Hi, I’m Brian David Gilbert, safety fan and bureaucratic wunderkind, please address

me as such, and I’ve spent the last week and a half poring over the regulations of

the United States Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration,

also known as OSHA.

I’m here to hold Super Smash Bros. to account.

Because when you take 70-plus beloved characters and force them to fight for our entertainment,

the least you can do is make sure the buildings are up to code.

So let's go ahead and FIND EVERY OSHA VIOLATION IN EVERY STAGE IN SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE.

First, let’s explain the process, we have to start by choosing the correct regulations,

and unfortunately, there isn’t a OSHA guide to “bloodsport,” so we're just gonna go

with construction, form 1926. 'Cause that's close enough.

The main thing to point out here is 1926.10 subsection A. I’ll read an excerpt for you

so you can understand the basic concept of this video, and also the hellscape I had to slog through

the past week: “no contractor or subcontractor contracting for any part of the contract work”

— that’s a real line — “shall require any laborer or mechanic employed in the performance

of the contract to work in surroundings or under working conditions which are unsanitary,

hazardous, or dangerous.”

Basically, we’re here to build a safer experience for these characters, because when you walk

into an unknown space, I want the first question on your mind to be:

There are roughly 350 regulations in form 1926.

How many pages is that?

About 684.

Don’t worry, this is... this is just a visual aid.

They're all blank.

I wouldn't waste paper like that.

*thinks of the times he's wasted paper*

Most of these regulations are irrelevant, but I

still had to read all 684 pages in order to know which ones to cut.

Which reminds me, this video idea came from commenter nshady16, so if you have an Unraveled

idea, why don't you go ahead and leave me a comment.

And thanks, nshady16, for making me read 684 pages of OSHA regulations,

you piece of garbage.

So I cut out all of the regulations that were just definitions, unrelated to stages, nonmandatory,

redundant, or about personnel safety, because again, we’re not talking about hard hats,

we're talking about the stages themselves.

Unfortunately, this also meant I had to cut out the entirety of subsection R.

Steel Erection.

So there goes like 80% of the jokes in this video.

Out of those 350 regulations, we’re left with 46 that actually relate to Smash Bros. stages.

And again, we're just using the 103 stages you get when you boot up Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.

Any any secret stages that pop up later, uh, that's probably just an underground fighting

ring, which is a different form of illegality.

I’m gonna explain all of these OSHA violations as we go along.

But I just want you to keep in mind that there is a maximum penalty of $12,934 per OSHA violation.

We’ll get into that later.

Let's get these OSHA violations on the board.

BAM!

That's all the OSHA regulations we'll be discussing today.

Let's start with the codes that pretty much every stage violates.

General safety and health provisions.

I threw these three here because they're just dangerous in general and they don't have that

many other specific violations.

Safety training and education.

Seems like most of these people don't have safety training.

Especially in Moray Towers, where they literally shoot guns at you as you fly into the stage.

Recording and reporting of injuries.

Wii Fit Studio is a gym, and so I would expect it to have paperwork if one of the gym members

gets injured.

Unfortunately, all of the gym members get injured.

Means of egress.

In most places, you have to have exit signs.

And also, you have to have exits that don't involve plummeting to your death.

Employee emergency action plans.

It's very important to have an emergency action plan.

Especially if that emergency action plan is for if a mountaintop breaks off and slides

into the ocean.

Look at this polar bear!

He has no fuckin' clue what's going on!

Accident prevention, signs, and tags.

Just put one wet floor sign anywhere, and I'll let it slide, okay?

Duty to have fall protection.

I mean uh... there's no fall protection.

How hard is it to put a harness on someone?

General requirements for stairways and ladders.

Anything above 19 inches of elevation needs a staircase or a ladder.

Not everyone can double jump.

Sanitation.

Most of sanitation deals with potable versus non-potable water.

But a lot of it also deals with toilets, and I have yet to find a Smash Bros. stage that

includes a restroom.

And I need to know where Donkey Kong pees.

So those ones pretty much everyone gets wrong.

Which means that we're at about 900 violations already.

Yikes!

I feel a bit bad hitting all of these stages so hard, so I'll be a bit lenient for 1926.50.

Medical services and first aid.

You have to provide first aid if someone has been hurt.

And I'll just let the max tomato fulfill that requirement.

451 states that you can't be using unstable objects as scaff.

I'm gonna call all of these scaff 'cause there's no OSHA guideline for levitating floors.

Jumping on an awning causes it to break in Onett.

That's totally irresponsible.

452 states that you need to have cross bracing.

Kongo Falls has so many things that aren't cross braced.

453 is all about aerial lifts.

You need to stand firmly on the ground while it is moving.

Stop jumping!

Housekeeping.

You gotta clean out the debris.

I don't care that you've got a big dog running around behind you... put the... put the blocks

away, that's debris!

Put your toys away, honey!

Occupational noise exposure.

I'm ignoring the fact that they're fighting on top of a jet and instead thinking about

how loud those jets are.

Pop some earplugs in!

Gases, vapors, fumes, dusts, and mists.

All of these stages have clouds that you can stand on.

Which means they're incredibly dense.

I don't care what it's made of, you shouldn't be breathing that in.

Illumination.

Those torches don't do anything.

I'm gonna trip and stub my toe.

Ventilation.

A lot of these stages need more airflow, better ventilation, but in Pictochat 2, there is

too much ventilation in the form of this man who blows air.

Who hired this man?

I don't want him on my job site.

Hazardous waste operations and emergency response.

In Flat Zone X, someone spills oil and then just leaves it there.

1926.150, 151, 152, and 154 are all about fire protection.

Most of these regulations are pretty self explanatory.

You need to have a fire extinguisher.

It needs to be readily available.

You can't have ignition hazards hanging around.

You can't store more than 25 gallons of a flammable liquid in one place.

By the way, I'm including magma as a flammable liquid.

I know they mean petroleum substances, but I think that's just a lack of imagination

on OSHA's part.

But 154 is all about temporary heating devices and how they shouldn't be kept in enclosed spaces.

Kind of like the charmander at the top of Saffron City.

The general requirements of electrical equipment.

They should be kept free from hazards that could cause death or harm to employees.

The large airships flying around you in these stages are not only electrical equipment,

but they are designed to harm and kill you.

Violation.

Specific purpose equipment and installations.

This is all about elevators and escalators.

WarioWare Inc. is one big elevator.

You don't need me to tell you it's broken.

Helicopters.

Is a Shy Guy a helicopter?

I think so.

You're not supposed to be working underneath hovering craft.

Even if they're bringing you fruit.

Conveyors.

That includes the stages that move back and forth and also all of the scrolling stages,

which are the fastest way to die in Super Smash Bros. Tools and material shall be secured

to prevent movement.

Don't move equipment unless it's safe.

They're on a live racetrack.

All of the things are moving.

Marine operations and equipment.

You have to have a lifering on a barge, and you have to provide a walkway between wharfs

and boats.

Paper Mario dissolves into a boat, but that doesn't count as a walkway.

And there is not a single lifering at the Donkey Kong residence.

I don't care how good you are at surfing, FUNKY KONG.

Underground construction.

If you're working underground, you're required to have a five-person rescue team on call.

And although Super Smash Bros.

Ultimate does allow up to eight players.

None of them will save you.

Working on or near exposed energized parts.

Does a pokemon count as an energized circuit?

According to OSHA, yes.

1926.1052 is all about stairways.

If you have a stairway that rises more than 40 inches, you need to have a handrail.

I imagine that Mario is about 40 inches tall, and this is at least four or five times his height.

Violation.

Violation.

VIOLATION.

VIOLATION!

Confined spaces.

These are places where you are building where it's hard to get in and out of.

You need to specify the acceptable entry conditions.

There are no acceptable entry conditions into a space with a pit full of acid.

Disposal of waste materials.

If you are dropping waste materials more than 25 feet, you need to be putting it in a chute.

Clock Tower: it is all debris that is falling infinitely.

And it SHOULD be in a chute.

850 is about preparing the demolition building.

You're supposed to remove any glass that could break.

And in Dracula's Castle, Death flies through the window and breaks the glass.

I couldn't give a shit about Death, you should've removed that stained glass first.

853, you can't have a aggregate of more than 25% of a floor destroyed, and in Find Mii,

he destroys half of the stage.

The manual removal of floors.

You can destroy a lot of things in Shadow Moses Island, but you shouldn't be standing

under them.

Tower cranes.

There is only one stage that violates this.

It's literally the only stage with a tower crane, and ya FUCKED IT UP!

Explosives should be stored in a magazine when they're not in use.

And in Wrecking Crew, they're just available for you to punch until they explode.

Firing the blast.

You shouldn't be in the proximity of the blast.

Nor should you be in the barrel that is causing the blast and shooting you off into space.

1926.53 and 54 are about different types of radiation.

Ionizing, which is nuclear, and non-ionizing, which is like lasers.

Final Destination is just flying around through random parts of space.

There is no protection.

You should be less worried about getting punched into oblivion and more worried about the cancers.

In Gamer, your mom fires lasers at you when she sees you gaming.

I'm not here to discuss her qualifications, but you are not allowed to fire those lasers

at employees.

JUST LET ME GAME, MOM!

Ladders.

Suzaku Castle?

You thought you could get away with that shitty-ass ladder?

Those ladder rungs need to be uniform.

They need to be evenly spaced.

They need to not be broken.

I know that ladder is there for aesthetic purposes, but THAT IS A VIOLATION, SUZAKU

CASTLE.

YOU CANNOT HIDE YOUR LADDERS FROM ME.

That leaves us with one stage.

The one that has violated the most regulations.

But I want to point out Boxing Ring.

The only stage that is OSHA compliant.

It's almost as if it was built to allow people to fight in it safely.

Sakurai, I know you worked so hard on this game, and I appreciate it so much, but you

could have stopped at just one stage.

You SHOULD have STOPPED at JUST ONE STAGE.

Finally, weighing in at 23 OSHA violations, it's 75m.

I'm not 100% sure if this had so many violations just because it is a construction site, so

it was easier for me to find all of the flaws with it.

Obviously, Brinstar is probably more dangerous, but I don't know how to categorize Mother Brain.

The thing that pushed it over the edge was material hoists, personnel hoists, and elevators.

They need to be enclosed at all times.

People can just jump on and off of these material hoists over there.

That's so irresponsible.

There's fire.

There are jacks that get thrown across the stage.

There is a large ape.

Again, I could not categorize that, but I know he shouldn't of been there! 75m is the

most OSHA violating stage in Smash Bros.

And if you have to get rid of one of them, that's the one you should get rid of first,

and then you should get rid of the rest of them, too.

Because, again, OSHA does not stop after one stage.

Let's remember back to the beginning of this video when I talked about violation penalties.

I mentioned that every serious violation of OSHA is $12,934 in fines.

I forgot to mention that every repeated or willful violation is $129,336 per violation.

I am going to pretend that I found all of these violations on the same day, and that

they didn't have a chance to fix them all, so therefore they are not repeated.

But that's still 1,317 violations.

Or $17,034,078 in fines.

Which is why I am sending you this video, Masahiro Sakurai.

Surely you can't afford 17 million dollars in fines.

I'm willing to let bygones be bygones.

OSHA doesn't need to hear about all of this evidence I've compiled.

All you must do is send me 50 US dollars.

I'm in a real tough situation right now and I just need to get through the month.

Please.

Also you could send me Kirby's phone number.

I know he is real.

Where are you hiding him?

And I have yet to see a Super Smash Bros. stage that includes a toilet.

And I need to see where Donkey Kong pees.

*Pat & Brian laughing* And I need to know where Donkey Kong Pees.

Oh god I was so close!

And I need to know where Donkey Kong peeHHSHSS.

*through laughter* sorry this is... *breathe in* AHHHH 
 2020-06-25 16:19:40,124 - DEBUG - file running:  *cheerful music, slowly diminishing*

Is life quantifiable?

Every breath, every beat of a heart...

Do they count as tallies etched tirelessly into the stone of our existence,

until one day, that stone is returned to dust?

Is there a number, an algorithm, underlying the spark of life?

And if given the chance to know the arcane secrets of that algorithm,

would you use that power for good?

Or would you use it to calculate your pet’s HP?

Because that’s what I would do!

*energetic music*

HIT POINTS!

What are they and how did they become the standard unit of life in nearly every game?

It all started with war games, tabletop games that involve a lot of little miniature military

forces fighting on a battlefield.

Back in the 1920s, the Naval War College created an early form of this in order to help evaluate

battles before actually fighting them.

They had a stat called “Life” which was determined by how many

14-inch shell hits a vessel could take.

So that’s what a hit point is, how many 14-inch shells it would take to kill you.

Every living creature is one hit point.

The end.

But that isn’t our current understanding of HP.

That came when war games shrank in scope and started to become more fantasy oriented.

In older games, you would roll dice, and then your troops would either survive or they would die.

You had large swaths of nameless troops so you could do this without feeling any remorse

over their deaths.

Haha.

War.

But when these games stopped playing with hundreds of troops and instead focused on

a few main characters, players realized they didn’t want their characters to die!

So the hit point was born.

Your character could survive X number of bad rolls before throwing them in the garbage.

So really, the hit point wasn’t made to quantify how easy something is to kill,

it was born from compassion and wanting to see your characters grow and thrive.

And then also to figure out how easy they were to kill.

We’ve had some semblance of HP for nearly a century, but we haven’t updated our real-world

understanding of what one hit point looks like.

So I’ll be doing that, specifically so you can quantify your pet’s HP.

A little disclaimer up front:

I am not giving you this algorithm so you can battle your pets.

Animal abuse is wrong.

And if you needed me to tell you that...

I’m glad I told you that.

I'm also not teaching you how to calculate human HP, because that power is too great to wield,

and it could easily be used for evil by some of the most wicked forces on Earth...

like health insurance companies.

No, I am teaching you how to calculate your pet’s HP as a fun bonding exercise between

you and your animal, or in case you happen to be at a house party where you don’t know

anyone but the hosts have a dog and so instead of just sitting in the corner pretending to

text people, you can spend your time calculating that dog's HP, which is a way more normal

thing to do in a social situation.

Now it is time for the research.

How are we going to effectively calculate ANY pet’s HP?

Luckily, there are plenty of games that cover pretty much every type of pet that you could

possibly have, but I’ll be using Pokemon as the main pet HP analog because it is literally

about having lots and lots of pets that you can love and cherish

and I’m ignoring all the other stuff.

And that brings us to our first criteria: Type.

According to the National Pet Owners Survey, here are the most common types of pets found

in U.S. Households.

I appreciate that they have included a category called “Small Animals,”

as if that means fucking anything.

So we're changing some things.

The standards are still there: Dog, Cat, Fish (and all aquatic creatures), Reptile, Bird,

Equine, Small animal is becoming small mammal for things like ferrets and rabbits.

We're also including bug, because I love bugs!

And if you have bugs in your house and you make the conscious decision to WANT those bugs in your house,

they aren't pests,

they're pets...s.

Amphibian for the frog people.

Farm animals covers any livestock that don’t immediately fit into the other categories.

Originally, I thought about classifying these quadrupedal animals as different sorts of dog.

Chunky dog, milky dog, horny dog.

But farm animal encompasses them a little bit better.

I am still keeping those names, though.

We also have a category I call “exotic,” which encompasses all of the animals you see

in instagram influencer pics that make you say,

This can go from monkeys to bats to hyenas, which, according to this incredibly reliable

website, I could technically own in New York due to a loophole?

*about to make a terrible decision*

Also, Millennials and Gen Z often live in tiny, “no pet” apartments and

don’t get paid enough to support a decent standard of living for themselves, let alone

a pet, so they’ll often turn to plants in order to feel the joy that comes from nurturing

a living thing in our rapidly decaying ecosystem.

*sigh*

So I’m extending pet status to plants so that way you too can do this HP calculation,

because, god, we all need a distraction sometimes.

By building a set of pet types, we are able to assign HP RANGES to each of them by finding

the lowest base HP and highest max HP of each type.

The absolute extremes of this scale are Shedinja, with a base HP of 1, and Wailord, with a max HP of 544.

Now, both of these would be pretty wild to have as pets,

considering one is the shell left behind after a cicada molts,

and the other is a fucking whale.

But that’s why they’re the extremes, and that’s why we are not done with our equation yet.

We might know the full HP range of a dog, but what is the HP range of YOUR dog.

I thought for a moment about having size be the next criteria, because you might think

that the larger the animal, the more HP it would have.

But that’s actually not true!

In fact, the Pokemon with the highest base HP is Blissey, this strange little egg woman.

And Onix, an enormous rock snake, has one of the lowest base HPs of all Pokemon.

This confused me, so I had to go back to the original popularizer of HP: Dungeons & Dragons.

And it was there that I realized what truly affects your HP value:

Your value is not defined by the size or shape of your body,

it’s about what you do with the body you’re given.

*cheesy motivational music*

It’s all about class!

As in, what standard gaming class does your pet fall into?

Every class has different HP ranges based on what they are expected to do.

Barbarians are out in the front lines, so they tend to have a lot more HP than a rogue,

who is slinking around in the back.

I’ve decided that the classes that make the most sense for pets are: Barbarian, Ranger,

Paladin, Cleric, and Rogue.

I haven’t included any classes like sorcerer, because if you have a magical pet,

what are you doing here?

Go cast spells with your turtle.

These class distinctions separate your pet’s HP range into 10 equal portions.

If your pet is a rogue, you get the first six.

If your pet is a barbarian, you're anywhere from five to 10.

Your pet’s personality will determine what class they fall into.

Your pet is a rogue if they are rakish, mischievous, and spry.

Cats tend to come to mind for the rogue category, simply because they’re always up in shit

they should not be up in.

Your pet is a cleric if they are kind, reserved, and healing.

A rabbit that hops onto your lap after a rough day of work and makes you forget all your

worries is 100% cleric.

Your pet is a paladin if it is loyal, resourceful, and, honestly, tries a little bit too hard.

Does your zucchini plant produce too many zucchinis?

A.K.A.

Any amount of zucchinis?

It's a paladin.

Your pet is a ranger if they are self-sufficient, aloof, and kind of do their own thing.

Ask yourself, am I holding my pet rat back from their true ambitions?

The answer is always yes, and your rat is a ranger.

And finally your pet is a barbarian if they are boorish, brazen, and courageous to a fault.

Does your dog dig under the fence so it can jump into your neighbor’s pool?

Your dog is Marmaduke.

It is also a Barbarian.

Your pet can have a combination of many of these traits, but it’s up to you to decide

which traits are most dominant.

Now that we have your pet’s type and class designated, we need to get into the nitty

gritty of their exact HP, which means finding your pet's level.

In order to do this, you must observe your pet in a scientific manner.

So I reached out to field biologist.

Hi, I’m Olivia.

I'm a wildlife biologist.

I contacted Olivia after she responded to my totally normal twitter request with this

dope-ass picture.

I figured that if anyone knew how to calculate the hit points of an animal, it would be someone

holding a huge bird like it was a torch.

Have you ever found the hit points of any of the animals you've been researching?

I've never been involved in any sort of study where that was something that we looked at.

So no.

Okay.

But there are probably plenty of studies about hit points with animals.

Probably.

Though she didn’t have experience with my specific question, I knew she would have some

useful advice for observing animals in their natural habitat.

When you're observing an animal, how much interaction should you have with it?

None.

None.

At all.

None.

You have to sit in like a blind or a tent of some sort where you're hidden or you look

like part of the environment.

You could wear a ghillie suit.

Brian - Oh!

Olivia - People have also done that.

How long of a period are you observing that animal for?

It depends on how much time and resources you have, obviously.

There have been scientists that have been observing the same hawk for, like, 20 years in a row.

So if I'm trying to... perfectly know my pet's HP, I should be observing it for

multiple years.

Yes.

Cool.

How do you take notes when you're observing an animal.

Right, so, I actually—can I send you something?

Yes, please.

This is exactly what I was looking for.

Olivia had sent me an animal behavior data sheet, which I could use as a template for

observing and recording a pet’s behavior.

But some of these behaviors wouldn’t make sense when observing your pet on a random day.

We ended up developing a new sheet that had standard behaviors and class specific behaviors

that had different weights associated with them.

You observe your pet for X number of hours, tally up all the behaviors they did over the

course of those hours, and then divide the weighted total by X to give you your pet’s level.

The logic behind this is that a higher level pet is more likely to do more intense and

class specific behaviors.

Then you plug that level into this algorithm, and you get your pet’s HP.

It may seem challenging, but science shouldn’t be easy, it should be correct.

This is probably the hardest scientific work you've ever had to do.

It really is.

Yeah.

With these tips in mind, I welcome you into my home.

In order to test these calculations, I need a test subject.

So I’m using my roommate’s cat, Zuko!

He lives in my apartment but he doesn’t pay rent and he eats my bagels if I leave

them unattended.

As I mentioned previously, finding your pet's HP can be a fun bonding exercise, and in this

case, I’ve been dealing with this small bastard’s antics for so long, I need to

remind myself why he’s here by quantifying his value.

The first step is easy!

He is a cat.

That puts him in the cat category.

Okay.

Step two, we gotta give Zuko a class.

As I mentioned previously, cats are often rogues, but I don't think that fits Zuko considering

he’s the least stealthy creature I know.

His meow sounds like he’s been smoking two packs a day for the past forty years.

*incredibly raspy meow*

And every time he does manage to sneak into his food cabinet,

he lets me know immediately.

Just wanted to check in on what's going on up here in the cat cabinet where we keep all

of the food for the cat.

*loud crash*

He is loud, stubborn, and not afraid to make terrible decisions in plain

view of me.

And that makes this guy a Barbarian.

Okay!

But now it is time to observe Zuko to find his level.

As per Olivia’s instructions, I must observe him for several years without any interaction.

After explaining why I needed it, my time off request was denied.

So instead, I ate some bodega sushi in order to induce illness, and I took a sick day.

Mmmm.

This is the hard part, because it's going to require me to observe Zuko as he goes about

his daily business without him noticing that I am here at all.

I assumed my position, and I waited for the interesting behaviors to start.

*cheeky music plays*

Not only was this terribly boring, but I was beginning to fear that Zuko

was not as strong as I had hoped.

DO SOMETHING!

PLEASE!

But then I realized there was a exploit in my system.

Though Olivia, a scientist, said that you should keep your interferences to a minimum...

I’m not a scientist, I’m a gamer.

And I began what is known as power leveling.

I had to get Zuko as many experience points as I could before my roommate got home and

asked me what I was doing.

Over the course of the day, Zuko averaged 63 behavioral experience points per hour,

although those behaviors were somewhat coerced by me.

I know that I broke my system by interacting with Zuko, but if it makes my pet happier

and it makes him less of a weak-ass scrub, why wouldn’t I game the system!

I had also noticed that Zuko and I had grown closer, our support level had increased to

at least a B. I no longer saw him as a freeloader who sometimes throws up in my bed,

I saw him as a companion...

who sometimes throws up in my bed.

When I felt lonely in my empty apartment, he was there for me.

When my stomach ached from the bodega sushi, he purred at just the right frequency to ease my pain.

When I was worried he was going to be under leveled, he soothed my anxieties

with his heavenly voice.

*beautiful meow*

And all this time I had spent trying to calculate his HP,

I hadn't realized he was replenishing mine.

So here is Zuko, Barbarian class level 63.

I love him with all my heart, and he loves me just the same.

Ow!

Okay, okay...

*lots of wonderful meows*

Beautiful.

Psst!

Remember when I said I really wanted to play the Cyberpunk RPG?

We finally did it.

Come watch me play as a totally uncool forum moderator called Vang0Bang0.

Guys don't say other things, we should only have one person in the...

You're making it sound like there are more than one person in...

There's only one person in the bathroom! 
 2020-06-25 16:19:40,125 - DEBUG - file running:  *drum beat*

THE SIMS! While other games push you through the meticulously crafted story

of some hero, this game allows you to experience the joy that comes from crafting your friends and family

and then making them pee themselves in doorless rooms.

I’ve been playing The Sims since I was a kid, and it allowed me to imagine what I might become.

A successful doctor, perhaps, with a mansion

and a pool that doesn’t have a ladder to get out of it.

And now that I’m a D-list internet video producer with a grungy apartment in New York City,

I’ve realized that I was using The Sims as wish fulfillment.

Perhaps there’s a better way.

I might only have one life, but my Sim can live many, many lives.

I was playing a game.

I should have been doing an experiment.

So today, I’m going to use The Sims to perfect my living situation.

*music stops*

Oh what a surprise!

Now, this Unraveled will be a little bit different

considering most of it is going to be game footage, meaning...

I don’t need any paper!

Let me explain my methodology. We will have two subjects:

Simulated Brian, and reality Brian, which is me, I’m Reality Brian.

Here’s my hypothesis: If Simulated Brian’s living situation can be perfected in the Sims,

then Reality Brian’s living situation can also be perfected by altering it the same way in real life.

Now, I could try to do this in a “perfectly controlled environment,” but life is messy and sometimes

science has to be messy, too. So before I can create my Sim...

I gotta measure my apartment.

Obviously, I have to work with what I currently have. And if I’m supposed to make an honest

simulacrum of my living situation I gotta make sure it’s to scale.

I should also point out that I live in a three bedroom apartment with two roommates and a cat. And although

they have rooms of their own, I will not be modeling them in the Sims.

Partially because I rarely spend any time in their rooms, but it’s more because I am a good roommate

who respects personal boundaries. I will not redecorate their personal spaces.

But I will exploit the common space for content.

When you cut my roommates rooms, you can split my apartment into 6 different sections.

I used vanilla Sims 4, because I didn’t want Simulated Brian to accidentally become a wizard, or a skeleton,

or a college student.

The first step is to make an accurate depiction of myself, both in personality and in appearance.

This took a good chunk of time, but it was worth it when I crafted an exact 1 to 1 replica

of myself in the Sims. Then, I built the space. I used my measurements and gave myself close

to unlimited funds to create the apartment, and bought myself the cheapest appliances

just like my landlord did.

At the end of this, I had a pretty exact reproduction.

Then it was test time.

I gave myself a career similar to my own, and then I let Simulated Brian do his thing.

My rule was that I had to have little to no interaction.

But after a few days, it became clear that there were flaws with my experiment.

One, it was too slow.

If I want a longitudinal look at Simulated Brian’s living situation, I need to see his ENTIRE life.

Two, this experiment is meant to perfect my living situation, not my job.

And currently, Sim Brian is finding enough fulfillment in his career, which is an uncontrolled space.

Sim Brian needs to stay in his apartment, and that means no job.

Three, Sim Brian was perfectly content reading books,

and everyone knows that books are BORING!

So I obviously need to fix whatever personality flaw turned my Sim into a dweeb.

I addressed the first flaw by downloading a mod that would allow me to put on Ultra Fast Speed.

I also altered my sim's personality to reflect my own… and I accepted that Simulated Brian’s appearance

wasn’t all that accurate in the first trial, so I fixed that as well.

With the new personality traits and the ultra fast speed mod, this trial was far more accurate.

I spent a lot of time standing in my bathroom, staring at the wall, or sadly contemplating my reflection.

And then Sim Brian died of starvation after 4 days.

Which is a MASSIVE SUCCESS!

I got to see the entirety of my Sim's life!

In trial 3, I took a hands-off approach.

I popped on ultra fast speed, and I let it ride.

In this trial, I die of starvation after just 2 and a half days.

Which makes me think that this mod might be so fast that Sim Brian can’t feed himself.

So in trial 4, I start on normal fast speed,

and I decide I’ll only jump to lightspeed when I’m bored.

And things start well enough!

Sim Brian manages to socialize and stay happy for two days.

It starts to break down on Tuesday, when I find my sim

sadly eating a grilled cheese in his empty kitchen.

And then on Wednesday, Sim Brian sadly eats cereal while staring out the kitchen window.

Things get real bad at 2 am on Thursday,

when he stares in the mirror for hours.

The ennui has set in.

That afternoon, he stands in front of some dirty dishes on the coffee table,

too depressed to wash them in the sink, which is mere feet away.

Sim Brian goes through the same motions for the next week.

Watching TV. Staring in the mirror. Sleeping at random intervals. He seems devastatingly unhappy.

But he manages to live a much fuller life than the past two iterations!

It takes him nearly a week longer to die of starvation!

Except, he doesn’t really die.

In an effort to expedite the death sequence, I accidentally hit ultra fast speed,

and for some reason,

this killed death.

I waited, hoping the reaper would respawn, but no.

So I rushed through the days.

Waiting for someone to find my collapsed body in the weird corner of my creepy hallway,

but the only people who noticed my quote unquote "death"

were the utility companies.

I used this moment to look around my neighborhood.

Most houses were far nicer.

I was alone in a little box surrounded by neighbors who had forgotten me, or perhaps never knew I existed.

Even death had forgotten me.

I watched my slumped body linger in limbo as nothing changed.

After a week, I resigned myself to quitting.

And then in trial 5 I peed myself!

A LOT!

Boy, trial 5 exemplifies how much my apartment needs an upgrade.

At the beginning of the trial, my sim left the house to socialize.

And he was so happy not being in his tiny apartment that he stayed outside for 12 hours,

ignoring his bodily functions, and at 9pm, while speaking to a potential new friend,

he peed himself.

Does this make the embarrassed and uncomfortable Sim go inside?

NO.

Sim Brian so loathes his living space that he decides to stand outside all night browsing the internet,

until again, he pees himself right before having a flirty conversation with his friend Terri.

Dirty, dirty Terri.

After another full day outside,

hunger, exhaustion, and the need to pee FINALLY make Sim Brian go home.

He was more willing to spend two nights soaked in piss before spending a single minute inside his apartment.

Big Mood.

The rest of his life was typical. Mirror. Standing. Dying of starvation.

After 5 control trials, it was time for the results.

Here’s what I learned:

One, I’d rather spend time outside my house in repulsive conditions than spend time inside my house.

Something needs to change.

Two, the only thing that ever managed to make Sim Brian happy

was “good decoration.”

I need to redecorate.

And three, Sim Brian managed his basic needs until he became desolate due to a lack of social interaction.

A hole so deep he couldn’t go anywhere but down.

And this makes me believe that the thing that killed me was not starvation,

but rather becoming so lonely that I no longer sought to fix my situation.

But that has nothing to do with my apartment,

so let’s focus on the things we can change!

Simulated Brian was happiest in these terrible trials when the decorations were good,

and that’s something I can fix in real life.

But before I do, let’s set some ground rules:

One, I can't alter any of the rooms in my apartment, or I'd lose my security deposit.

Two, I can't change the furniture, because my roommates bought it, and then they’d hate me.

And three, the money. I had considered giving my sim a budget similar to my own,

but money cannot buy happiness.

And if this is true, then money, when compared to happiness, has no correlation.

Therefore, money is no object, and my sim should be allowed to purchase anything regardless of price.

Infinite money.

Sims decorations show how many environmental points they are worth.

By this logic, it doesn’t matter how well a room is decorated…

it matters how MUCH a room is decorated.

So I spent a solid hour giving my apartment the most decorations possible.

Allow me to give you a first person tour.

The Living Room now has lots of beautiful paintings.

The Weird Nook now has a purpose as The JAZZ Room, because for some reason,

the Sims has SO MANY JAZZ PAINTINGS.

The TV has to stay, but now I have three maps around it to say, “I’m also smart sometimes.”

The Kitchen hasn’t changed because it’s small and there’s no space to hang anything.

The creepiness of the hallway has crystallized into Sad Clowns.

No one wanted to spend much time in this hallway before,

and now they REALLY don’t want to.

In my room, a bunch of portraits, an apple wall, and a pear wall.

This should remind my sim to eat food.

And finally, in the bathroom, I installed a second mirror so I can’t just stare at the wall.

Now let’s see it in action.

In the first trial, I did another hands off approach on ultra fast speed,

and my sim once again died of starvation super quickly.

So, yeah, maybe the mod is too strong.

BUT! In trial 2, things go way better.

For the first time in any of the trials,

my sim manages to go from Very Sad to Happy, thanks to the tasteful decorations!

Though Sim Brian has moments of ennui and loneliness, for the most part, the house is making him happier.

Sim Brian does so well that he survives after the utilities shut off his power and water,

and he dies of starvation after more than two weeks.

That’s nearly DOUBLE the length of any of the other trials!

MY DECORATIONS WORKED!

Yeah, I still die of starvation, but I’m living TWICE AS LONG!

And that’s all the proof I need that this is the perfect form of my apartment.

All I gotta do now is make it in real life.

Polygon said that they wouldn’t reimburse me for purchasing thousands of dollars worth of paintings,

even though I TOLD them it would make me more productive,

so I gave myself a budget.

Then I went to a lot of thrift stores to purchase

as many paintings as I could find.

Some fit the aesthetic. Others would need alterations.

But I got a lot of things! Or, I thought I had, until I got home and realized

it wasn’t even going to cover one of my walls, let alone all six rooms.

So I dug around my apartment to find anything that could be stuck on the walls.

In the end, I was able to fill the entrance, but the rest of the living room was pretty sparse.

In the Jazz room I put up a papier mache man playing the piano, a dart board that felt pretty jazz to me,

and a skeleton wearing a tank top that says "I heart my Daddy,"

because...

I honestly didn’t know where else I could put that.

In my own room, I put up the appletini painting and

hung a huge self portrait from my senior year of high school.

And that was it.

That’s all I had in terms of decorations.

I took the day off to do this, but I was done in an hour.

I even put on my suit in order to film the results of the trial,

but my house felt as empty as it had when I began.

I couldn’t start the live experiment because I couldn’t recreate my sim’s house.

But I wasn’t giving up.

If I couldn’t purchase the decorations I needed, I figured I could make them myself.

So I bought a bunch of washable paint and 1000 feet of butcher paper.

“I don't need any paper!”

I lied.

It was a week before Thanksgiving. I was going to be out of town

and I needed to finish this part of the video before I left.

That meant I had to create about 70 large paintings in less than three days.

I got a solid start, painting all of the apples and pears.

I even managed to edit the two paintings I got from the thrift store into Sad Clowns.

But I was halfway through the second Sad Clown when this process started weighing on me.

If I had to spend a few hours on 10 of the simplest paintings,

there was no way I was gonna get this finished before deadline.

I was alone in an apartment making shitty paintings for a video that wasn’t gonna get made in time.

I got a stress migraine, so I turned off the camera, and I went to lie down.

When I woke up from that heinous nap,

I decided to do one of the most difficult things I’ve had to do for an Unraveled:

I asked for help.

And if you’ve never had to ask your friends and coworkers

to help you paint terrible paintings for a stupid video,

let me say you’re not missing out on much.

It’s an uncomfortable thing to ask people to do.

And honestly, the weirdest part of this whole process is that...

people said yes.

People said they'd come help me paint.

And, and they said yes just because they wanted to,

and also 'cause I said I’d buy pizza,

but you gotta grease the wheels somehow.

So I turned my house into a painting factory. I cut the paper. I moved the furniture.

And that night, people came over. Not just my roommate and my coworkers but my friends,

and friends of those friends.

I was expecting one or two people to help me, but I ended up with 10 people in my house,

all painting large scale portraits

and REALLY GOOD SAD CLOWNS.

Seriously, who knew that my friends were SO GOOD at painting sad clowns?

I don’t 100% know how to feel about how good my friends are at painting sad clowns,

but I'm glad I gave 'em an outlet.

All of these people came over just to make my apartment happier.

To lend a hand when I was overwhelmed.

And not only were they helping me make my apartment happier by decorating it,

they made it happier just by being there.

This task that had given me a stress migraine became a really fun time.

And it reminded me that, although it can sometimes feel uncomfortable or embarrassing,

if you ask for help, more often than not,

people are willing to help

you paint large pictures of jazz men.

In three hours, a task that seemed insurmountable by myself was complete.

And I was so excited that I did the walkthrough while they were all still there.

The Living room with fabulous landscapes,

The Jazz room’s huge murals.

The Creepy clown hallway that was way too good.

My room with its amazing portraits and fruit walls.

And the bathroom, where I stared at myself,

not considering my flaws or my apartment, but just smiling.

That’s it.

Just smiling.

It’s been well over two weeks since my apartment was redecorated,

which is longer than I survived in the Sims trials,

so it’s been an incredible success.

My apartment is perfected, I’m happier with it, and it’s all thanks to the redecoration.

Or at least, that’s part of it.

I think that part of the reason I find so much joy in my apartment is knowing

that the decorations were made by people I care about.

There’s a story behind it.

Simulated Brian fell further into sadness due to his isolation,

but the paint night turned Reality Brian’s terrible situation into something joyous.

So I have to wonder:

Does my newly perfected apartment make me happier because of the decorations,

or because of the people who helped me decorate it?

Trick question, it’s obviously the decorations.

JESUS! 
 2020-06-25 16:19:40,125 - DEBUG - file running:  Ah, the Elder Scrolls, games chock-full of lore.

And Skyrim is no different.

Hidden amongst the draugr and dragons is a plethora of books full of very important

and incredibly niche details.

But with all the spellcasting and shouting you must do as dragonborn, who really has

the time to read all those books.

I DO.

APPARENTLY.

I read every book in Skyrim in order to answer the eternal question, “Should you read every

book in Skyrim?”

And I’m here to give you my top five recommendations of books, here in my SKYRIM BOOK REPORT.

Skyrim book report!

How many books are there, really, in Skyrim?

After all, there are only eight people credited as writers on Skyrim.

Those eight people are responsible for every quest, every voice acting line, every response

you can give to an NPC.

How much time do they have to write all those other books?

A lot!

Because they wrote this many books.

This many books.

*pained grin*

Or at least they wrote most of them because a few of them have been grandfathered in from

other Elder Scrolls games.

Before I get into the nitty gritty, let me explain my process on how I did this Skyrim

Book Report.

I printed out every book in Skryim, and then I spent multiple eight-hour days reading EVERY.

SINGLE.

BOOK.

I whittled it down to 338 books because I didn’t include journals or diaries.

Everyone knows that self-published doesn’t count.

In total, that’s 571 pages, five and a half point font, over three hundred and sixteen

THOUSAND words.

I had two reactions to this.

My first reaction was, “Wow.”

This is an incredible amount of world building.

To write 300,000 words that could essentially be skipped over while still having the full

Skyrim experience, it’s amazing, and it’s a level of world building that could only

exist in an interactive medium.

And for that, I commend you, Bethesda.

My second reaction to this,

was WHAT THE FUCK.

HEY TODD?

WHAT THE FU-

In my Skyrim Book Report, I will be discussing:

*smack*

That’s a smash cut.

Hopefully.

If I do my editing correctly.

338 books.

Uh, actually, 337, I just realized, um, over here, Songs of Skyrim, I put both of them

in there, but there’s a revised edition.

I lied.

It’s just 337 books now.

Obviously, I don’t have time to synopsize all of these, and believe me, you wouldn’t

want to watch that even if I could.

I’ve split them into categories to make this a little bit easier.

First up, historical books!

These book titles you see rolling up the screen are all biographies or histories.

What I categorized as histories was anything that had big historical dates in them, explanatory

histories, or pretty much anything that was boring.

History’s so BORING.

UGHHHH.

J.R.R. Tolkien

*kiss*

did the world a disservice by making every single fantasy writer think

that they need to chronicle every goddamn minute of their world in order for it to be

legitimate.

I don’t give two shits about a king who lost a war 700 years ago.

*snoring noises* Get OUTTA here!

Some of these biographies are actually pretty interesting.

But a lot of them are written like The Chronicles of Nchuleft.

I didn’t tab it out ‘cause it’s a shitty story.

“It happened in Second Planting (P.D. 1220) that Lord Ihlendam, on a journey in the Western

Uplands, came to Nchuleft; and Protector Anchard and General Rkungthunch met him there, and

Dalen-Zanchu also came to the meeting.

They talked together long by themselves; but this only was known of their business, that

they were to be friends of each other.

They parted, and each went home to his own colony.”

RIVETING.

Ugh.

History’s so boring.

I’m done with this.

Next category: Instructional books!

These are all field guides or basic recipes about how to make good armor or what flowers

go in which potions.

At best, they are in-fiction instructional books.

At worst, they are so obviously trying to get you to go do specific things.

Pulls you right out of the fiction!

C’mon man.

That’s all I’m gonna say about that.

Everyone’s favorite: the academic books.

Fun fact about academic books that I learned in college

is that no one has ever enjoyed writing or reading an academic paper.

WHY’D YOU PUT IT IN A VIDEO GAME.

Mythicaaaaal stories.

It’s kind of weird to differentiate things between myth and history, especially in this

world where you can talk to demon princes.

I split these two up because these are very boring and these are slightly more palatable.

They’re more like creation myths, or they’re just like random stories that are fun to read,

so they’re getting closer to good fiction.

The poetic and dramatic.

Everyone knows that poetry and theatre are meant to be seen and not read.

And you have NO IDEA how much it pains me that I do not have time to do staged readings

of all these.

Oh my GOD I would have loved that.

We have “eh.”

What genre is “eh?”

It’s the catchall.

Um, these tend to be accounts, kind of like medieval fantasy op-eds.

So I…

I just put ‘em here.

EH!

We’re done with these now, so…

Get outta here!

Finally, we have 59 books that I would consider good fiction.

GooooOOOD fiction.

What I did here is I gave myself three criteria about what would make good fiction in the

realm of Skyrim.

Number one, does it help build the world around us?

Number two, does it give us an interesting or different perspective on that world?

And number three, is it good?

Now you might say, “Brian, what gives you the right to say what is good fiction?”

I READ ALL 338 YA DINGUS.

BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY THAT THESE WERE THE ONLY GOOD ONES.

THIS IS ALL I’M QUALIFIED TO DO NOW.

I need a drink.

*deep breath*

Okay!

There’s still 59 of these, so I obviously can’t summarize all of them, but I have

left five off, and they are my top five books of Skyrim.

So we’re gonna talk about those.

Number five, Advances in Lockpicking.

Now Advances in Lockpicking is actually an instructional book.

But I think it does more than just the other instructional books, where you open them up

and suddenly you’re better at lockpicking, because it’s written by a thief in a very

interesting voice.

There’s a great ending line for this book: “Some thieves can’t read.

If you can’t read, get someone to read this book to you.

It will make more sense then.”

That’s great.

I think that’s a much more fun way than saying, “Here is how you pick a lock.

This is what this set of armor is.”

Better than instructional.

Just good fiction.

Number four, Palla.

In a world where crazy creatures exist, how do you make fiction that is compelling that

people can just kind of experience in their own life.

Palla is a necromantic romantic book.

It’s a story about a man who sees this beautiful statue of a woman fighting a beast and falls

instantly in love with this woman.

Turns out, she’s dead!

From fighting that beast.

He decides to get into necromancy to bring her back from the dead.

I kind of don’t want to ruin the surprise for you.

It manages to tell an interesting story while also introducing these ideas of monsters and

necromancy.

It’s kind of weird, but it’s very well written.

I’m gonna go ahead and put up three and two.

Why do I put up the Argonian Account and Feyfolken at the same time?

Turns out, it’s written by the same fictional author: WAUGHIN JARTH.

This one’s for you, Waughin!

I’m a big Jarth head!

He’s not actually in the story at all, I couldn’t find any instance of, like, him

as an NPC.

So I really hope he’s in the next one.

Because I want to meet Waughin.

I just want to meet Waughin Jarth.

These ones were not actually written specifically for Skyrim.

They were grandfathered in.

But they do an incredible job of building the world around you.

The Argonian Account is actually the second story in a series all about Decumus Scotti.

This is kind of like the Hobbit of Tamriel, where we’re taking this unassuming character

and thrusting them into this completely foreign, amazing landscape, except instead of a hobbit,

it is a midlevel bureaucrat.

It’s full of screwball comedy and wonderful worldbuilding about the Black Marsh which

is where all the Argonians live.

You have to fast travel by being eaten alive by a worm.

That’s great.

I want to see that whenever we go to the Black Marsh.

It’s so flavorful, and that’s why I’m a Jarth head.

Feyfolken.

It’s a story about a scribe who’s terrible at his job but gets this enchanted quill that

forces him to be amazing.

Sends himself into this madness, and he kills himself at the end of the book, spoiler alert.

But that’s not what this story is really about.

It’s an interesting fiction that teaches you about different Daedric princes, and which

ones could have caused this specific enchantment on the quill.

That’s good worldbuilding!

I am interested in the story!

You told me something that I can learn about the world.

I had a good time reading Feyfolken!

Jarth, ya did it again!

And that leaves us with the number one book.

It’s not The Lusty Argonian Maid.

I feel like I should broach this subject.

I’ll tell you why I didn’t include it in my good fiction list,

and it’s not because I’m a prude, who doesn’t love a little erotic lizard fiction?

*OOH COME ON BABY*

The reason I didn’t include The Lusty Argonian Maid as one of the best

pieces of fiction is because it’s SEVEN ACTS LONG.

Seven acts?

There is no way you can manage to maintain that level of erotic tension for seven acts.

That’s like five and a half hours!

As a person who has done one or two plays in my life, that’s just unfeasible.

Okay?

I’d like to see them try.

~I would like to see them try~

*OOH COME ON BABY*

Before I go to number one, I gotta go

get a flu shot.

This is not a joke.

It’s important to get your flu shot.

Alright, I’m back.

The number one piece of fiction in Skyrim, not Waughin Jarth, I’m sorry.

It’s Beggar, Thief, Warrior, King.

It’s four books, actually.

But it’s all part of Eslaf Erol’s story.

It is completely fiction even within the fiction of Skyrim.

The reason I put it first is because it’s the only book that was legitimately hilarious.

I straight up chortled.

*chortle*

That’s what I did.

In real life.

That’s amazing.

The writing style of these four books is just naturally hilarious.

There are so many bland, cookie-cutter stories in Skyrim that follow the same set up, twist, punchline.

This doesn’t have that.

It’s just a good story.

One of these writers was just flexing, and I think that’s wonderful that a writer had

a chance to—within the fiction of Skyrim—write something that’s just naturally funny.

You should all go home, onto your computers, boot up Skyrim, find these four books, and

then read them, in order.

It’s worth it!

That’s my quest, for you in Skyrim.

300 gold points.

That’s it!

That’s it, that’s all of the books.

So like, what did I learn from reading all 338 books of Skyrim?

Surprisingly, a whole lot.

Like, there are two main takeaways that I pulled from this.

Number one, this is a masterclass on how to write effective flavor text.

Between all of these, historical, instructional, the good fiction, and, you know, the iffy fiction.

This is a way to learn what to do and what not to do.

Obviously, not everyone is going to connect with certain types of flavor text.

I’m sure there’s a lot of people that disagree with me and think that the historical

is the most important flavor text.

And you know what?

They are valid.

And they’re wrong.

And they always seem to find my comment sections.

When you take something good like Feyfolken which teaches you about the Daedric princes,

but in an interesting way, it really shines in comparison to the three and a half million

biographies of Barenziah.

You don’t even see them in Skyrim.

I don’t care about Barenziah.

IT’S BORIIIIIII-

But not like Feyfolken!

That’s really interesting and effective.

Also it just teaches you about all these wonderful forms of fiction.

If you’re a fiction teacher, like, teach your kids with Skyrim!

TEACH THE KIDS.

WITH SKYRIM.

I got a creative writing degree.

That’s all I have to say about that.

Second takeaway, this is a wonderful teaching device about unreliable narrators.

So many of these histories are negating other ones.

This is a wonderful way of showing people you need to read everything if you’re going

to get the whole picture.

I read everything.

I am the keeper of the picture.

That’s every book in Skyrim.

So it’s time for us to revisit that ever present question, “Should you read every

book in Skyrim?”

NO!

WHAT?

HOW COULD YOU WATCH THIS WHOLE 10+ MINUTE VIDEO AND THINK THAT I WOULD SAY ANYTH- WHAT?

NO!

I BORE THIS BURDEN!

FOR YOU!

DON’T READ THEM!

NO!

Please don’t read them all.

DON’T READ THEM!

You can read the top five, that’s fine.

GRRRRR.

HOW DARE YOU JETTISON MY GIFT!

DON’T READ THEM!

NOOOOOOOOOOO

screaming

This new Sonic has a lot of fans crying heresy.

Sonic should be that cute, blue, cartoon hedgehog that’s gotta go fast,

and that’s all he’s gotta do.

But what if I told you that this was not the only blasphemous version of Sonic

What if I told you that nearly every single piece of Sonic media was heretical

I hold in my hand 13 pages that prove just that.

Before I hop into the deep end, I need to explain a little about Sega, these 13 pages,

and how Sonic was made.

You see, Sega was in a real tough spot in the early ‘90s as it tried to compete with

Nintendo and the overwhelmingly successful Mario.

So they worked internally to create a new mascot.

Not just for a game, but for the company as a whole.

Naoto Ohshima created Mr. Needlemouse, a teal hedgehog with red sneakers.

And then he worked with Yuji Naka to create a game around this wonderful creature.

A few tweaks and Sonic the Hedgehog was born.

Or at least one version of Sonic was born.

You see, Sega wasn’t just fighting with Nintendo, it was also fighting with itself.

Sega of America and Sega of Japan had a lot of tension between them, and they didn’t

see eye to eye on a lot of things, especially when it came to Sonic.

The original version of Sonic was a bit more punk rock and had a girlfriend.

A real life human girlfriend named Madonna.

And we all know that Sega would never make Sonic kiss a real human woman.

discomfort

So Sega of America started to iron things out a little bit.

Make Sonic a bit more family friendly.

More marketable.

Madeline Schroeder, the self-described mother of Sonic, wrote out this 13-page bible that

set out Sonic's true origins.

These 13 pages went on to become the true Sonic.

The Sonic we all know and love.

Right

NOPE.

THIS BIBLE HAS HAD VERY LITTLE BEARING ON THE SERIES AS A WHOLE.

But here’s the thing, friends.

It should have a lot of bearing on the series as a whole.

And I am willing to wield this bible as a paladin wields a holy sword so that I might

EXCISE SIN OUT FROM THE SONIC CANON.

I'm sorry.

That was a lot.

I was a bit too intense for...

I'm gonna tone it down a little bit.

Folks, we’re about to engage in a friendly session of biblical literalism.

Now, I’m not one to advocate taking a written account as the pure truth and nothing but...

but for Sonic I’m willing to bend my values a little bit.

We're about to take everything written in these 13 pages as gospel, and anything that deviates

from the facts therein as sacrilege.

Let’s get Sonically Fundamental.

I’m not gonna read this bible in its entirety.

You can read it online if you'd like.

But I am going to read the first paragraph in full, because I think it's important for

you to understand what we’re dealing with.

“Sonny Hedgehog was born on Earth in the early 21st century, in the town of Hardly,

Nebraska, population 1,226.”

From the first line alone, we already know that

1. Sonic’s birth name is actually Sonny.

2. He is a real hedgehog that was born circa 2000.

And 3. He’s a midwestern boy.

“He and his mother and five sisters live underneath a scraggly hedge beside the local

burger joint, and subsist on burger scraps, milkshakes, and the occasional slug or bug

that crawls their way.

They are a poor but happy family.”

From these lines we know that

4. Sonic's family lives in an actual hedge, which is I guess why they're called hedgehogs.

And 5. They have a very similar diet to me.

“Unfortunately, Sonny’s dad died when Sonny was just a few days old, after falling

into a gurgling, festering vat of toxic waste dumped in a nearby pond.”

…

What

Sonic, the lighthearted hedgehog we all know and love.

Never knew his father because he was reduced to sludge thanks to corporate pollution.

There are 30 key tenets in the Sonic bible,

and I'm just gonna go ahead and list them off real quick.

just a big ol' mess of words from the Sonic bible

The 30 tenets of the Sonic the Hedgehog bible.

Look at 'em up there.

Beautiful.

Practically glowing with potential energy.

The potential energy I shall release into a HOLY FLAME, SO THAT I MIGHT BURN OUT THE

BLASPHEMY FROM SONIC'S MODERN ITERATIO...

Pat I think, uh, we should probably just take a couple minutes, just to, just to like...

Brian Okay.

Pat I'll... do you need water or anything

Brian Water... yeah, I think that'd be good.

Now, most of these are not found in most of the iterations of Sonic, but there are three

that specifically decanonize every game in the Sonic franchise.

Let's talk about 'em.

Number 18 There are seven chaos emeralds, one is a stabilizer.

You might have heard me say the name Kintobor.

He turns into Dr. Robotnik after he is fused the powers of the chaos emeralds and a hard-boiled egg.

Not a joke.

But he was originally looking for the chaos emeralds so that we he could bundle them up

and then launch them into space, thus reversing all pollution on the planet Earth.

The reason for that is because the Chaos Emeralds “contain a microlytic copy of all the inert

energy of every gross and disgusting impulse or deed done by humans since the beginning of time.”

Ignoring that microlytic is the name of a company and not an actual scientific term,

this seems to state that the chaos emeralds are just a crystalline form of every gross impulse.

Every time you pick your nose instead of using a tissue.

That’s in the emerald.

Every time you wear your underwear five times in a week 'cause you think it doesn't smell that bad.

That's in the emerald.

Every time you go three days without shampooing

I get it.

Look, sometimes, you know, the shampoo has sulfates and that can damage to your hair.

We all have different scalps.

BUT THAT'S IN THE EMERALD, TOO.

Most of the games just state the chaos emeralds are an incredible source of power, something

that will help you to take over the world or become Super Sonic.

They don't ever mention that they are essentially just garbage diamonds.

Had Sega included one piece of flavor text, like “You got a chaos emerald.

You should probably go wash your hands, now.”

Then it would’ve been fine.

But they didn’t.

Number 21 Kintobor was a father figure.

Just as a reminder, Sonic’s dad died in a vat

of toxic waste.

Which is why it meant so much when Kintobor offered him an assistantship.

“Sonny was thrilled at the prospect.

Because although Sonny had never known his father, Kintobor reminded him of the kind

face in the photograph.”

Heartbreaking.

Can you imagine the drama in this

Sega, you keep trying to do these gritty reboots of Sonic.

Sonic plus gun.

Sonic plus getting kissed by a human woman.

You don’t need all that.

It's all right here!

You are literally pitting Sonic, a hedgehog without a father, against the man who became

his father figure and then turned evil thanks to the machines that SONIC HELPED CREATE.

I hear you saying, “Brian, there’s no evidence that Sonic doesn’t think of Robotnik

as a father figure!”

And to that I say bullSHIT.

I have NEVER SEEN HIM CRY AFTER DEFEATING ROBOTNIK.

I HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM HOLD THE LIFELESS BODY OF HIS FATHER FIGURE AND SAY,

I am sorry it had to turn out like this!

I am sorry!

LET SONIC CRY OVER THE LOSS OF WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN, SEGA.

YOU COWARDS.

And finally, the third and most important tenet that destroys the entirety of the Sonic canon.

Number 11 Sonic helps quilters.

Have you ever seen Sonic in a quilting circle

Cause he should be there.

“While making the rounds for juicy tidbits and gossip, he would drop in on the ladies

of the local quilting circle to offer a convenient pin or needle from his ample, portable supply.”

WHERE IS MY SONIC GAME WITH A QUILTING CIRCLE

Sonic CD shitty.

Sonic Mania trash.

Sonic Hedgehog 2.

More like Sonic the Hedgehog Too MUCH OF A DUNCE TO INCLUDE TO THE QUILTING CIRCLE THAT

IS SO INTEGRAL TO SONIC'S BACKSTORY!

And with that, we have decanonized the entirety of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise.

But from this scorched earth can bloom a mighty flower.

The true Sonic the Hedgehog.

What would that video game look like

What are the ramifications of a Sonic the Hedgehog game based on the bible

The Sonic the Hedgehog bible.

Let’s go through this piece by piece.

We start the game with a legitimate hedgehog who lives in a hedge and his name is Sonny.

And it's 2019, and he's got brown quills, and they won't become blue until he gets faster.

And he eats food that is similar to the food that I eat.

He lives in Hardly, Nebraska, which is where the entire game is set, so you better get ready

for running in lots of corn fields.

His eyesight’s not good, but it’s okay cause he’ll get rec specs since he is able

to read but is also on the track team.

So the entire game is actually just running in track meets in the middle of a corn field.

When he’s not running track, he’s at the bowling alley or the playground or the quilting

circle doing normal hedgehog things.

The problem is that his town has SO MUCH POLLUTION, which is how his dad died, and it’s also

why Kintobor (now Robotnik), the trim kindly scientist who gave Sonic his new nickname

and the ability to speak the human tongue, was trying to solve with his new physics theories

and his machines and all of those terrible gross seven chaos emeralds before he became

evil and also a bit of an egg.

This is especially rough because Kintobor, before he became Robotnik, would feed Sonic

really good food and was basically a father figure to him.

Also Sonic is good at computer science.

So the game is basically an evil polluting scientist being taken down by a midwestern

teenage hedgehog track star with daddy issues.

So it’s basically if the CW rebooted Sonic.

Reach out to me, CW, I will license this.

But I haven’t used all 30 of these tenets.

See, there are four of them that, to be perfectly honest, shouldn’t be possible.

And beyond that, they are impossible to put into a game.

I've hit a bit of a roadblock.

Number seven shows Sonic's dead father winking at him through a picture on the wall, which

proves the existence of an afterlife in the Sonic Universe.

Number 15 shows that Sonic is able to hibernate below delta waves.

And those are the slowest possible brain waves.

About 0.5 hertz.

To go below them, Sonic would have probably died.

And yet he is resurrected and lives again.

And number 24, Sonic is shown to run at the speed of light.

And if the rules of relativity are to be believed, that means his mass would have to infinitely

expand, and he would need infinite energy to do this.

And that would destroy the world.

And yet he is able to do that without harming himself or those around him.

Number 30 is actually within the bible itself.

It states, “But like most peaceful times in the twenty-first century, it didn’t last long.”

This bible was written in 1991, nine years before the twenty-first century, and yet it

prophesied our challenging political landscape.

These four pieces of information are not purely canonical information.

They are...

divine miracles.

So of course I could not put them into a game.

They could only fit in a religion.

So I went on to wikiHow, the foremost explainer of how to do things, and I knew somewhere,

hidden in their beautiful imagery would be the way that I could spread the word of Sonic

to the masses.

And before you get upset with me, saying,

Brian, aren't you just starting a cult

Look at this question answered by Cutegirlcorr

Technically speaking, religions and cults are the same thing.

So I have formed my religion around Sonic the Hedgehog.

And guess what

I have a confession!

I'VE NEVER PLAYED A SONIC GAME.

NEVER IN MY LIFE.

I only tell you this now because you've already made it this far into the video,

and the sunk cost fallacy states that if you feel like you've invested something,

you're gonna see it through to the end.

But it's okay that I haven't played a Sonic game.

Because that means I haven't been tainted!

I have never beheld the false Sonic!

Only someone blind to the modern blasphemies of the Sonic franchise

could see as clearly as I!

Because if a hedgehog could commune with the dead,

be resurrected,

run with infinite energy,

and HAVE HIS GOSPEL PROPHECY THE FUTURE,

THEN EITHER SONIC IS A GOD

OR COULD KILL GOD

AND I DO NOT CARE IF THERE IS A DIFFERENCE!

Hello, friends, I’d like to take a moment now and apologize for my recent outburst.

I’ve taken some time and cooled down since filming this video, and though I suppose I

could have just not uploaded it to YouTube, I decided it would serve well as a cautionary tale.

You see, taking lore to be purely literal, whether that's for a video game or backstory

for a TV show, is a dangerous rabbit hole that can often lead to anger.

Biblical literalism is just an early form of fandom.

Sometimes, you gotta be a little bit more lenient.

Because sometimes, the bible was written to make a character

more marketable to kids in the '90s.

So let’s learn from this example, and make sure to take new additions to our favorite things in stride.

Even if it’s these legs.

I’m sorry, I can't in good conscience agree with that.

I do not agree with those legs.

I'm sorry.

I could spr... if you spray painted my legs blue, I could cosplay as this Sonic.

Do you think I should do that

Do you think I should spray paint my legs blue for a Sonic cosplay

Just half...

Just half, half down Sonic.

Not gonna do anything else to my body, just...

everyone loses it 
 2020-06-25 16:19:40,126 - DEBUG - file running:  Stamina! That mysterious green juice that powers our muscles.

In video games, it allows characters to cleave dragons, climb volcanoes,

and lightly jog through a prairie.

I look at these heroic tasks, and I think…

How?

Look, I’m usually pretty high energy, but the fact of the matter is that

I’ve been stuck at home for the past two months

and I’ve cultivated the stamina of a cartoon basset hound.

I used to be so much more productive, and my energy has just completely vanished.

Is it because I’ve been having trouble adjusting to this new working-from-home lifestyle?

Or is it because my build is trash?

Today, I’m saying goodbye to that boring, languid Brian, and I am going to use the things I’ve learned

from video games to maximize my stamina.

*synth music*

I gotta go ham on these graphics ‘cause I don’t have a studio anymore.

There are two main ways that stamina is represented in video games:

stamina bars that automatically replenish, and stamina bars that don’t.

And these different representations lead to different techniques for boosting that stamina.

My hypothesis is that if I use these same stamina techniques in real life,

then I will finally have the energy to address laundry chair.

*Sad accordion music*

There are four methods of augmenting your stamina in video games.

Let’s start with the easiest one to understand. Item Refills.

You expend some energy, you eat something to replenish that energy. It's basic biology.

The Krebs cycle or something like that…

I am not interested, get that shit outta here.

The problem is that most video games are usually more fantastical than real life.

Oftentimes the item you need to consume is an elixir made from arcane magicks

siphoned from the very lifeblood that sustains our world.

Or, if you’re Hideo Kojima, it’s Monster Energy.

God bless you Death Stranding for having a magical canteen

that effortlessly turns dangerous Timefall into a branded energy drink.

You know, for a video game that loves to give you a 40-minute-long cutscene

explaining why some dipshit is named "HOTWETMAN" or whatever,

this piece of world building has a much simpler explanation:

MONEY.

And thanks to this shameless product placement, I have a concrete way to determine how to refill stamina.

Judging by Sam’s experience, it takes about 600 milliliters of Monster Energy to fully juice your bar.

And given the fact that this logic exists in a world where everyone is stuck in isolated homes

and delivery people are among the most important of essential workers,

I think it’s safe to say that conditions could not be better suited for this experiment.

The biggest difference between me and Sam Bridges is that I’m not getting paid by Monster Energy,

so I don’t have to pretend to like it.

Technique 2: Slowing Depletion.

Unlike item refills, this one asks you to do some planning.

You only consume one of these items before you have to do a huge task,

so it usually shows up in games where preparation is key,

like when you have to go fight a 40-ton pickle.

Monster Hunter has battles that can last upwards of an hour,

which can make the preparation as important, and as long, as the actual fight itself.

Kinda like eating a full pasta bake before the big track meet.

There are quite a few ways to slow stamina depletion in Monster Hunter,

but sometimes the simplest option is the best one,

and in this case, the simplest option is steak.

Steak is made from raw meat in Monster Hunter

— and also the real world —

and if you eat it, it boosts your max stamina.

But the effects change based on how you cook it.

A rare steak refills your stamina bar and makes it longer,

but a well-done steak does all that AND it slows your max stamina depletion.

The steak snobs among you may turn up your nose at the assertion

that a well-done meat is better than a wet, juicy, rare one…

But I posit to you this question:

Which one would you rather have jangling around in your leather satchel?

So I’ll be cooking these meats until they are all-the-way gray.

Technique 3: Stamina Regeneration.

With this technique, every time you use stamina, you’ll get it back faster.

And there is no game that makes you say,

“come on refill come on come ON COME ON COME ON REFI-”

more than Dark Souls.

In Dark Souls you consume stamina every time you attack, block, run, parry, roll, backstep,

backstab, ripost, jump, shoot arrows, call your mom, check your bank account…

And if you’re in the middle of a boss fight and you have run out of the stamina necessary

to dodge roll or swing your big sword,

well, them’s the breaks, kid.

Luckily, there are some accessories that speed up that stamina regeneration.

And even more luckily, you can purchase legitimate versions of these items for about... 300 bucks.

Uh, no thank you. I can make that at home.

And even if I did have the means to purchase these official props,

there’s still one massive problem.

The in-game items are imbued with dark, abyssal magicks

that I simply do not have the arcane wisdom to conjure.

Luckily, I do have one little piece of magic I can use.

It’s called: The placebo effect!

There are plenty of psych studies that show that clothing choices

can have an effect on our mood and your confidence,

and there are even more studies that show that placebos can have legitimate beneficial effects,

so why wouldn’t donning The Mask of the Child help me deal with laundry chair?

*More sad accordion music*

And finally, technique 4: Permanent Increases.

This is by far the best way to maximize your stamina.

When you’ve got all the stamina in the world, even the heaviest of tasks won’t phase you.

There are plenty of realistic games that use this technique, like Red Dead Redemption 2,

where the only way to increase your max stamina is to do a bunch of stamina heavy tasks, like sprinting.

But the thing about this technique is that…

IT SUCKS.

UH, I’M SORRY?! You’re telling me that in order to have more energy,

I have to use up all the little energy I have? That’s recursive logic.

I don’t have any energy to begin with, and you want me to run a mile? Bullshit!

So since Rockstar doesn’t actually care about realism, let’s talk about a more grounded game:

Breath of the Wild.

In this game, Link can trade four spirit orbs to increase his hearts or his stamina.

But I want to focus on this little guy, the Horned Statue.

Here, you can do a different sort of trade… a devil’s bargain. You can increase your max stamina...

YOU JUST HAVE TO GIVE UP SOME LIFE.

The only problem is that I can't figure out how I would gain more stamina

by doing something physically detrimental, like using a shampoo with sulfates.

I would never do that.

So for now, I’ll be focusing on the first three techniques.

Here’s how the experiment will go: I will spend one day on each technique,

rating my stamina level every hour of that day.

If I’m at a 0, then I’m either sleeping or dead, so most of my stamina levels will be between 1 and 10,

with a 1 being the stamina level of a hotboxed sloth,

and a 10 being the energy of a 6-year-old at a laser tag party who just finished his first can of mello yello.

My goal is to be at a level 10 at all times.

I’ll also be rating the boosts based on three criteria: Boost speed, Boost endurance, and Boost Quality.

But first, we have to do a control trial. Which is just a normal day.

“Just after 7 o'clock on a Monday. I'd say my power level is at a 5. I'm about to have some coffee."

I went about my day as I normally do, which is to say, boringly.

If we take a look at this graph, you’ll see that there were two little spikes.

The first one, which happened after I had my morning coffee,

and the second one after I hit a real low spot right after lunch.

I have no idea if I’m pointing to the right places.

“It's half past one. I decided to be productive by at least leaving my house.

Gonna go buy a liter of Monster.

You can't tell because I'm wearing a mask, but I'm grimacing under here."

This is obviously just one control trial,

but it is emblematic of the lethargy I’ve been feeling for the past few weeks.

I never got above an 8, and in fact my average for the full day

was just a little bit higher than how I was feeling right after I woke up. That’s pretty bad.

But it means there's nowhere to go but up.

And I’ll be going WAY UP with the first technique trial.

“Feeling about a 5, not super tired, not super energetic.

But instead of making coffee, I instead will go and take a swig from my canteen,

which I have filled up with three different Monster Energy drinks, up to the liter mark.

If I'm at halfway through my stamina right now, I should be drinking 300 milliliters. Let's see if this kicks in!"

And the effects of Sam Bridges’ favorite concoction did, indeed, kick in. "8 o'clock!

Let's, okay, obviously the energy drink has, uh, affected me. Let me put this down so I

can move around with my hands. I can still have more stamina. Yeah, I feel like I'm at

an 8 right now. You know normally I'd say that that's fine. I'm trying to be at the

peak performance level. Another 120 milliliters down the hatch. Let's do some work, baby!

*singing* Don't mind me, just gonna do some work right now. Feeling fine! Probably a 9.

Or maybe a 9 and a half! Maybe a 10? Probably... I'll, mmm, 9 and a half. Can we get waffle

fries? Does anyone deliver waffle fries? NO FILMING! Let's go write more scripts!" Things

were going great for me in the stamina department. Until they weren’t. *incoherent mumbling*

"The crash, and then right after eating lunch has kind of... just brought the whole thing

down to a 3. Now that I have seen that Monster gives me a super high and then immediately

crashes me, I’m going to do the only thing a sane person would do, and consume more monster

energy. Let's go to work!” And though I went searching for that magnificent, full

stamina feeling I fleetingly experienced in that morning, I still averaged less than the

control trial for the rest of the afternoon. I drank 3 full cans of Monster Energy.

“If I hadn’t had the monster energy, would I have been dead right now? I don't understand.”

There was only one little spike that happened after I had to go outside to pick up steaks

for the next day’s trials, and though the energy drinks didn’t keep me up all night,

there were some other side effects, that ultimately led to a bad review of this technique. “My

body is tired, but my mind is just, there's some anxieties in there? And also I feel,

like, physically not great." Still I had high hopes for Trial 2. Since the previous two

trials trended downward, I had hoped that Slowing Depletion would help. Unfortunately,

due to the previous day’s trials, I was operating at a deficit. "Went to bed alright

and then I woke up about 2 hours after that, and then kept waking up every 30 minutes.

I'll tell you what, more than anything in the world, what I would love to do is go ahead

and brew myself a pot of coffee, but you know what, I’ll do you one better.

Super cheap, beef eye-round steak.

I’m gonna ahead and grill one of these puppies up to a healthy 160 degrees Fahrenheit.

Let’s get some breakfast going.”

I tried my best to go into this experience unbiased, and honestly, the first steak of the day wasn’t that bad.

“I feel more powerful."

And though it didn’t give me quite the same bump as the Monster Energy,

my stamina levels rose and stayed level for the entire morning.

“It feels like I'm maintaining it a lot better.

Maybe I really am not degrading my stamina. It is almost lunchtime.

Maybe I'll eat two well-done medallions of steak."

That’s exactly what I did. Sadly, the second meats of the day were not as wonderful,

and this is where the true challenge of this technique came in.

“I do really wish I was eating something other than this.

The problem is that I'm still very hungry, and... but I also don't want to eat any more well-done steaks.”

With my stomach rumbling and my stamina flagging, I decided to try to take my mind off it by

working on the accessories for the next day’s trials. And this did give me a little stamina boost,

and that stamina maintained, but other things weren’t going so hot.

“Great, stamina’s going alright, but I am so hungry,

and also so upset with idea that I have to eat more of these well-done pucks of meat.

But I'm gonna make the last two!

Now a lot of you might be wondering, doesn’t it get easier over time?

And the answer is obviously no.”

By the end of the day, it's easy to see that though my stamina didn't get quite as high,

it did last longer, so there might be some truth to this slowing degradation technique.

But unlike the Monster Energy trial,

this one was both literally and metaphorically harder to swallow.

There’s a reason energy drinks aren’t chewable.

Luckily, our final trial didn’t make me consume anything.

“I slept a little bit better last night, at least, so I'd say I'm at, like, a 4.

But the goodnews is that I know just what to do. Let me go put on my accessories.

I already feel energized.”

Okay, full disclosure, as much as I believe video game logic,

I did just tape some tin foil onto some cardboard.

I wasn’t expecting much from this trial.

But the results speak for themselves.

“Why don’t I carry around a shield more often!

This makes me feel so powerful!”

I had a morning boost that rivaled Item Refills!

Sure, working in full garb was a little bit annoying,

but that didn’t stop me from being an active participant in my virtual meetings.

"Yeah, I can, I can help out with that, Jenna, if you need any extra help on that one."

Jenna - "Yeah, Brian. I guess so."

But around 11, the mask and shield were getting to me,

so I started altering which of the accessories I was wearing.

There’s no set bonus, so as long as I have one item equipped,

my stamina regeneration should be a little bit faster than normal.

“For the past hour, I took off the mask, and I’ve just been living on the Chloranthy Ring.

I do feel more tired. I'm gonna rethink about the mask."

At 1:30, I had to do a stream, and I did that in the mask.

And sure enough, my stamina was boosted after that experience.

In fact for most of the day, the accessories helped and didn’t make my stomach hurt,

but there were other costs.

“I don’t like wearing this mask.

I feel like my stamina has increased. But it seems like there's an obvious trade off going on here,

because, like, it's not, it’s not comfortable to wear. You can see, like, it's been squishing my nose.

I’m deciding whether or not I want to have higher energy levels or if I want to feel comfortable,

is really what's happening at the moment."

Take a look right there.

I imagine that the Wright Brothers wore a similar expression the day they went to Kitty Hawk,

because that is the face of a man who is ready to soar.

Remember how I said I couldn’t figure out how to trade health for stamina?

Well judging from these previous trials,

each one of them was physically detrimental in a specific and wonderful way.

"I feel, like, physically not great."

"Why am I still so hungry?"

"It's not comfortable to wear."

Perhaps I could trade my health for more stamina by doing every technique at once.

Welcome to The Final Trial!

“Waking up this morning and realizing what I was going to have to do today

really just made me not want to get out of bed.

I am about to do all three stamina things at once.

I’m not expecting it to feel good, but I am expecting

an increase in productivity unlike... anyone has ever seen from me.”

So after donning my outfit and grilling up a well-done steak,

I sat down for breakfast.

“God I hate this steak.”

And by 9 o’clock, I felt the effects.

“I think maybe god didn’t intend for us to wake up and drink an energy drink

and eat a well-done steak and then wear a tin foil mask.

I’m at a 5.”

Okay, so the boost didn’t happen right away,

but let’s remember that some of these boosts take a while to warm up.

And given the fact that I'm increasing my max stamina,

I should be hitting a 10, maybe an 11 or 12, by midmorning.

Except things didn’t change.

“It's 10 o'clock and I'm still at a 5. What the hell?

I'm just gonna cook all the steaks, I'm gonna drink all the energy drink, I'm gonna wear this while I'm doing it.

I'm just gonna do it all right now. I'm tired of this. I'm also physically tired."

I ate four steaks.

I drank all of the rest of my energy drink.

I was GOING to increase my maximum stamina.

“I’m ready to take on the day.”

*pained moan*

It turns out that doing every single stamina boosting technique at once fills your stamina bar so full,

that the bar explodes.

I felt physically ill and had to lie down for several hours.

I can’t even review this boost technique because it just knocked me unconscious.

But I will say that I did rebound later that day.

“So I left my house.

Came out here to take a little walk while maintaining adequate social distance.

I feel... I feel a WHOLE lot better.

You can't tell, but I'm smiling under this."

And this made me rethink some of my trials.

Most of my afternoon boosts weren’t due to gimmicky ingestibles, they were because I took a small walk,

or I did a fun craft, or I talked to my friends online.

Was I doing these techniques for nothing?

Is video game logic wrong?

No.

I just didn't understand what video games were teaching me.

Getting good at Dark Souls or Monster Hunter is about knowing how many swings of your big sword

you can do before you need to take a break.

It only becomes a major issue if you completely run out, and you have to spend a few seconds staggered,

or spend a few hours lying in bed.

Maybe the real stamina technique I need to learn is recognizing that, right now,

I may not be able to do as much as I want to.

But if I focus on the little wins,

I can manage my stamina, and I can manage my expectations for my stamina.

So although I may still wear the Chloranthy Ring, it will just be for the fashion.

And today, I’m gonna take care of laundry chair.

You tell me when the camera stops rolling so I can stop folding.

*SYNTH BANGER* 
 2020-06-25 16:19:40,126 - DEBUG - file running:  WALUIGI.

The tall bastard man that Nintendo loves to disrespect. We know he's number one.

But who really is he? And where did he come from?

And why hasn’t Nintendo given him his own game.

The cult following of Waluigi cannot be overstated. He is an icon.

The patron saint of weird content creators.

But isn’t it strange that this character so beloved by Nintendo fans

seems to be completely disregarded by the company?

I don’t believe that’s actually the truth.

Nintendo cares almost too much about their characters.

They rarely put a character into a game unless they're 100% sure it’s a good fit.

And I think this is the reason why Waluigi has been sidelined:

Nintendo doesn’t know what Waluigi is all about.

So, Doug Bowser, I have collected every single piece of Waluigi lore into this one

simple video, and I’ll be presenting it to you, so you can finally make that Waluigi game.

Wahaha!

That was my first attempt, I'll get better.

In order to understand Waluigi perfectly,

we have to take a look at every appearance he's made in a Nintendo game.

They’re the only ones that count toward canon.

If you'd like me to discuss Waluigi's noncanonical appearances, I can definitely do that for you, Doug,

it'll just have to be in my off hours

because it is DEFINITELY not safe for work.

Here’s every Waluigi appearance sorted by release date.

These 63 games contain the entirety of Waluigi’s characterization.

He is playable in 50 of them, and we can split those playable games into Sports and Party Games.

I combed through each of these appearances, grasping at any piece of Waluigi characterization,

but the vast majority of them treat Waluigi as a meat puppet. A space filler.

An extra body on the character select screen. And, honestly, that’s one way to see Waluigi.

I hear you, Doug Bowser. Why should I care about a space filler character?

Well, you already care about a space filler character.

A little fella named Mario.

Let’s discuss Waluigi’s counterparts to shed some light on his origin.

The original Donkey Kong was supposed to have Popeye characters, but Nintendo couldn’t get the license,

so Shigeru Miyamoto created an unnamed player character as a stand in.

And that space filler was later named Mario.

People think that characters have to have some deep backstory in order for people

to like them, but that’s NOT TRUE. People love Mario BECAUSE of his humble origins.

The same cannot be said about the rightfully despised coward boy that is Luigi.

You see, Luigi was made because they needed a player 2 in the game, so they just palette swapped Mario.

That is a character filling a space by copying another filled space.

As much as I hate to admit it, I will have to revisit Luigi later in this video,

because he is key to developing the personality of Waluigi, and that's partially because of Wario.

Wario wasn’t made by Miyamoto. Supposedly, the team behind Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins

didn’t enjoy being forced to make a Mario game because they didn’t create the character.

So Hiroji Kiyotake created a bad Mario, someone that had all of Mario's evils exaggerated.

And finally, we have Waluigi, who was created by the same character designer who worked on Golden Sun.

The guy who made Saturos and Isaac and all of these intense powerful characters

used his talents to make the most intense, most powerful character.

And he made him for a very important reason:

because Wario didn’t have a doubles partner in Mario Tennis.

If Wario is just the evil exaggerated form of Mario, then Waluigi's the same for Luigi.

And that’s really all we get from Waluigi’s first encounter.

That, and the fact that Luigi is not afraid of him.

*Mario Tennis music plays*

"Luigi not afraid."

Luigi, the milksop who is afraid of all, is not afraid of his evil, funhouse mirror twin.

There’s something to that, but I don't know if I can quite grasp it without discussing all of the lore first.

So let’s switch back here.

As I mentioned before the tangent, Waluigi often plays the role of meat puppet,

so not all of these games have lore that is useful to us in developing a Waluigi game.

So I’ll take them off the board.

After cutting, we're left with 5 references to Waluigi, 7 party games, and 13 sports games.

From these 25 appearances, we can take all the juicy morsels and put them into a list of Waluigi Truths.

Let’s start with the references.

Though Super Smash has notoriously snubbed our large purple child,

the trophies do a pretty good job of fleshing out his character.

Super Smash Bros. Melee lays out 8 Waluigi Truths in just three sentences:

Four things right there: Tall. Thin. Evil looking. “Seems” to be Luigi’s rival.

That one isn’t really definitive, so we’ll keep it ambiguous.

Waluigi is a mischief maker, and he takes it seriously.

Luigi is exactly the same age as Waluigi, and I do not know who that reflects worse on.

Also, I love that Waluigi is connected to Wario, but no one's ever cared to take a closer look.

Are they friends, accomplices,

lovers?

It’s unclear!

The next Smash games really hammer home these truths,

only adding that he must also have a crooked mustache, a large nose, and a love of kicking.

Hmm.

*crashing noise*

The final reference comes from Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle,

where a large rabbid called Bwaluigi appears.

This is the closest Waluigi has ever come to appearing in a plot-based Mario game.

A fucking rabbid has had more screen time than the original Waluigi.

What can we learn from this?

As we move onto the party games, a lot of Waluigi’s lore is reiterated.

The main additions are that he is a misanthrope who loves to party.

There are two strange pieces of info in the party games.

In Mario Party 5, each pairing gets a different team name, and Mario plus Waluigi are “Psuedo Bros.”

Not enemies.

It seems like Mario is okay working with Waluigi instead of Luigi.

The second weird piece of info is in Mario Party 4, where Waluigi is described with the quote:

“That Waluigi's a serious sneak! Watch out for his Sparky Sticker..."

This quote doesn’t have any useful info for us, but the phrase “watch out for his sparky sticker”

is the worst and I hate it and why’d you put it in a family friendly video game, Nintendo?

Finally, we have the Sports games, where Waluigi started.

Mario Tennis set the tone for Waluigi with two truths.

One, that he’s highly skilled as a technique player. And two, that Luigi is not afraid of him.

This one's still weird to me.

These ones all have quotes that reiterate what we know about Waluigi.

He's hardworking and he's skilled, even if he cheats sometimes.

We have some metaphysical characterization in Super Mario Strikers, where the legend states

“Waluigi's ego tends to be his biggest enemy.”

In Mario Hoops 3-on-3, his Baller Name is “The Question.”

Which I think just solidifies him as an enigma.

Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games shows that Waluigi is a great jumper,

and Waluigi’s special move in Mario Super Sluggers is the Liar Ball, which is a ball that

he splits into two copies, one real and one false,

which emphasizes his mischievousness.

In Mario Power Tennis, there is a blooper reel where Waluigi is aware that this is all a show.

Does this mean that Waluigi is able to break the fourth wall,

or does it prove what I already knew,

that Waluigi is great on camera.

It's hot under these lights, anyone else hot in here? I'm just gonna pop this bad boy off if that's okay.

*crashing sound*

And in Mario Tennis: Power Tour, Waluigi appears without Wario.

Their relationship was never clear, but it is surprising that Waluigi, who was built to be Wario’s tennis partner,

can appear in a tennis game without him.

Luigi’s still there. Why can’t Waluigi exist without Luigi, save us all a headache.

And that’s basically all of the Waluigi lore you can learn from the games. The 23 Waluigi Truths.

And you can use them to create a Waluigi video game.

And I could stop this video here, Doug,

but I’ll tell you what, I'll do you a favor.

I'll tell you what I think the Waluigi game should look like, since I’ve done the research for ya.

If you’re gonna make a Waluigi game, you're gonna need to make it distinct.

Nintendo does a great job of tying gameplay to what makes a character special.

Mario’s got platformers locked. Wario has eccentric greedy microgames.

Luigi...

you know what, let’s actually go through Luigi’s truths and see how it led to Luigi’s Mansion.

Luigi is foolish, he's a coward, he's weak, he's pitiful.

And you take these truths and you think, hmmm, what kind of setting would allow this mistake of

a human to really exhibit his uselessness?

A haunted house!

This man has been bamboozled into comedic haunted house entrapment three times,

something most Hollywood stooges have only been duped into once.

He’s a big dumb idiot, and I would HATE to be associated with him.

But Waluigi is Luigi’s twisted reflection, so his game will be far removed from this numpty.

Let’s make it.

First, we're gonna move the truths that are physical traits to the side, since they're baked into Waluigi.

Next we have to decide on a cast of characters.

Honestly, Waluigi has been sidelined for so long that this needs to be a solo mission.

Now, let’s talk about the rest of these truths.

If you were to separate them out, you could probably make dozens of different games.

A mischievous prank game. A, uh, game where Waluigi gets schwasty every night.

And I’m not opposed to these games, but Waluigi contains multitudes.

Why does he turn to mischief? Why does he work so hard only to be cast aside by society?

Who is this enigma of a man, whose true enemy is himself?

The Waluigi game, like the man,

should be a mystery.

Nintendo already has wonderful mystery games, but they’re too cute.

Waluigi is raw. He's real. To convey the complex emotions of a complex man,

we can’t rely on traditional animation styles.

The Waluigi video game

should be Full Motion Video.

Doug, I know this is a wild concept. Nintendo is not known for live action video mysteries,

but Waluigi is just the intellectual property to explore this new genre.

Imagine Waluigi as a hard-nosed investigator, struggling to pick apart the pieces of who he is.

A man solving himself.

I mean, there is the issue of casting.

You gotta find someone who’s evil looking, and has a crooked mustache,

and a big nose and is great at jumping.

And, you know, that's a... that's a hard task to find one guy who's got all those features, you know, I...

Well now, wait a second, Doug.

If you take a look at my truths, you'll find that they're nearly the same as Waluigi's.

I’m hard working, I’m a bit of a scamp, and though I might not be as tall and lean,

there’s enough of me that WANTS to be Waluigi that I’d devote everything to being him.

I need this role, Doug.

I’ve spent the past few months devising this pitch for you. No one wants this more,

cares more about Waluigi than I do.

I will fight Charles Martinet for this role.

Is that what you want, Doug?

YOU PICK THE WEAPONS.

I WILL END HIS CAREER.

And that’s why I hope you’ll consider me for Waluigi’s Currently Untitled Full Motion Video Game.

But there’s something that's still nagging at me.

I’m sure you noticed that I didn’t address all of these Waluigi truths.

Why does every single quote state that Waluigi "thinks” he’s Luigi’s rival?

You could read this as Waluigi not being important enough for Luigi to consider him as a rival,

but why go through the trouble of putting that in EVERY SINGLE description?

Why not just make their rivalry canon?

And the fact that Luigi is not afraid of him is mind boggling.

Luigi’s personality is 90% fear and 10% being green.

Mario is shocked when Waluigi appears, and yet Luigi is calm,

like he somehow expected him.

And if Waluigi thinks his biggest rival is Luigi, then how can his actual biggest enemy be his ego?

Does that make Luigi the ego to Waluigi's id? A-a-and if...

"You can't have a Waluigi without a Luigi." "He splits into two copies, one real and one false."

"Pseudo Bros. Not enemies." "Why can't Waluigi exist without Luigi?"

Luigi and Waluigi are the same person.

*Vesti la Giubba starts playing*

It’s so simple. Luigi is just manifesting his own repressed desires as an alternate personality,

a shocking twist that no one's ever done in media before.

Waluigi is just the exaggerated form of Luigi’s deepest desires.

The want to be skilled. The want to be respected.

The want to PARTY.

Waluigi is everything Luigi wishes he could be but could never be

under the famous gaze of his famous brother.

What an amazing twist. What an amazing truth.

What an amazing role for me as Waluigi.

Think of the accolades, the game awards, the respect.

As someone who wished to be Waluigi for so many years!

As someone... who wished...

If there are two personalities, am I number one, or am I the one who is longing?

Oh god. I'm not a Waluigi.

I’m a Luigi.

No no no... Nonononononono!

*mirror shatters*

*shaver buzzes*

And that’s just ONE potential ending to Waluigi’s Currently Untitled Full Motion Video Game.

If you’re interested in licensing the idea, Doug, feel free to reach out to my agent,

and we can get filming tomorrow.

Or in like… five months 'cause I am gonna have to grow the mustache back-

I probably shouldn't have shaved it before we...

You know what, I don't have an agent, so just don't contact me.

I don't want to play Luigi, so.

Pat- "Can you sob while doing it?" Brian - "Okay."

*sobbing while shaving*

Pat - "Head back."

*Brian gags and coughs* *Jenna and Pat laugh*

Brian - It's so hard to sob while shaving because it gets in your mouth. 
 2020-06-25 16:19:40,126 - DEBUG - file running:  I love the Legend of Zelda series.

But the canonical timeline doesn’t make any sense!

Perhaps it would make more sense if someone tried to put every single piece of Zelda media,

canonical and noncanonical, into one timeline.

Someone should try to do that.

Let’s go!

Let’s start with the canonical timeline.

So we’ve got Skyward Sword at the very beginning.

Created Demise, and then he becomes Ganon later on.

Link gets resurrected.

It’s Minish Cap.

It introduces Vaati.

He’s a wind sorcerer.

And then he also shows up in Four Swords.

That comes next.

After Four Swords, Vaati is sealed, Ganon’s back, baby!

And it’s Ocarina of Time.

So Ocarina of Time splits into three different timelines here.

In one of them, Link decides to stay an adult, Ganondorf gets resurrected, and Link is nowhere

to be found.

And where’s Link?

Where’s Link?

I’ll get to it, don’t worry, I’ll get to it.

And then the whole world floods, and we get Wind Waker.

This one I’ll call “Adult Link.”

In this one, he decides to stay a child, the sacred realm is sealed, he’s finished his

entire meaning of existence by the time he’s like 12, and so he goes and does Majora’s

Mask, which is also very existential.

And then over here, Nintendo decided to make a timeline where Link loses.

Link just can’t do it in this one.

Ganondorf does whatever the hell he wants to, and now it’s A Link to the Past.

One of my friends invited me over to watch him beat Ocarina of Time, because he was really

close to finishing it, and then I went over and then he couldn’t do it, and so then

we decided to go outside and play basketball.

This is that timeline.

So we have “Adult Link,” “Child Link,” “Basketball.”

Let’s go back to “Adult Link.”

After Wind Waker, he just goes and hangs out with pirate friends in Phantom Hourglass.

We go to Spirit Tracks.

This is on a different island, and technically there is Link and Zelda, except Link is really

into trains now.

Let’s do the child one!

We go from Majora’s Mask into what is canonically called the Era of Twilight.

Obviously, it’s Twilight Princess next.

Then it gets a little bit darker and goes into the Age of Shadow.

We do Four Swords Adventures, which is different from Four Swords.

One has Adventures in the title.

Here’s some issues with canon over here in “Basketball” timeline.

In the Hyrule Historia, which came out in 2011, it states that next should be Oracle

of Seasons and Oracle of Ages, but the Japanese Zelda website technically states that it goes

Link to the Past, Link’s Awakening now.

So they’ve reversed those two.

So even the canonical timeline isn’t, like, super hard set-in-stone canonical, which goes

to show that it sucks.

He does this thing and then he goes sailing and then he crashes and has a dream and then

dies in the ocean.

I’m gonna keep Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages tied together right now.

A new Link, new cycle, and he goes A Link Between Worlds.

And then it’s another existential crisis, but this is my favorite one because instead

of having an existential crisis and then going to have to save the world from a moon, or

having an existential crisis and hanging out with pirates, he just gets really into fashion

in Tri Force Heroes, which is what I plan to do in my midlife crisis.

It’s The Legend of Zelda, the first one!

Zelda II: The Adventure of Link.

This is the same Link between these two.

A cult wants to resurrect Ganon or something.

We’re at the most recent game, and the most recent in the timeline, it’s Breath of the Wild.

You might be wondering, where does Breath of the Wild fall?

In which timeline?

Is it “Basketball,” is it “Child,” or is it “Adult?”

Well guess what: IT’S ALL THREE.

NINTENDO COULDN’T FIGURE IT OUT, SO THEY DECIDED TO JUST PUT IT IN ALL OF THE TIMELINES.

WHICH ISN’T HOW TIME WORKS…

TO MY KNOWLEDGE.

*vague gesturing*

I’m gonna make this timeline much worse, but I’m gonna also explain the convergence.

So what I’m gonna go to next is Zelda spinoff games.

I’m not gonna talk about some specific things, namely cameos, or when you can buy Link’s

clothing in other games, or some of the mangas because they’re just the same exact stories

as some of the main canonical timeline games.

I’ve wrapped all of these up.

Some of them don’t have connections yet.

Don’t worry, I’ll get to it.

Let’s start with the easy Zelda spinoffs.

There were a lot of them during Twilight Princess.

Link was also learning how to use his crossbow for big game hunting, and also it was Twilight

Princess Picross.

Midna wanted to… she thought picross would help him…

beat Zant.

We’ll start from the beginning.

Skyward Sword was supposed to be the first one, but they’re wrong.

Hylia chose her first hero, there was, like, a lot of time between the first hero and the

one that happened in Skyward Sword, and in that time was the Zelda Game & Watch.

Just like in Skyward Sword, there was an upper level and a bottom level, and then there were

dragons also in Skyward Sword.

That’s my logic behind this one.

You say “Zelda Game & Watch, what about the Zelda Game Watch?”

That’s right, the Nelsonic Zelda Game Watch.

This was a watch that you could play Zelda on, and there were only four dragons in this one.

Why?

Because the other Link already defeated the other ones!

There were three other dragons in Skyward Sword, and they were nice because they learned

that Link would fuck their shit up!

Link: The Faces of Evil and Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon.

I’m not an expert on this one because I’ve never played them.

Which I think is probably the best decision I’ve made in my life.

Right over here, why?

Because in Link: The Faces of Evil he has to go to the island of Koridai.

Islands?

In the great sea!

Obviously, that’s where they make sense to go.

Uh, Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon can go there, too.

SQUADALA!

But that’s not the only CD-i game!

There’s also Zelda’s Adventure.

Ganon, I guess he stole some celestial something-or-others, and then it started the era of darkness.

And remember what I said before about how it went to twilight and then to shadow?

What comes after that?

That’s right it’s darkness, baby!

Y’all know about the Satellaview?

It was a weird thing for the SNES, or the Super Famicom because it was just in Japan.

It insisted on all of the Satellaview games including the letters BS.

BS The Legend of Zelda: Kamigami no Triforce was just basically A Link to the Past, so

I didn’t include it in this one.

But there are other BS Legend of Zelda games, and they’re weird because they don’t actually

include Link.

They include these two characters that you could choose, and they technically part of

the Satellaview thing, so it wasn’t Link who was there, but… um…

I’ll explain in a second.

I cut one of the titles in half.

Clayton, we have to start over.

A Link to the Past happens and then Link goes away on a journey into the water and then

he dies.

What’s happening while Link goes on adventures is BS The Legend of Zelda.

It happens after that, during Link’s Awakening, when Link runs away, which is why those kids

are the ones in this.

And then after that it goes Link…

The Legend of Zelda: Ancient Stone Tablets.

And technically, since those kids are the ones that are in BS The Legend of Zelda, that

technically means that they are an iteration of Link, and so BS-X: The Story of the Town

Whose Name Was Stolen, which was a game that included those protagonists, but, um, didn’t

include anything about Zelda, technically is still a Zelda game, so I included it in

this one.

Barcode Battler II, you had to scan cards with a barcode and then you would have to

battle those enemies using it.

A different retelling of the same story as A Link to the Past, just like looking at it

from a different camera angle.

Tingle exists in actually two different timelines, and he also exists in every timeline, because

Tingle is, um, the perfect evolution of humanity.

He shows up in Majora’s Mask first, and he also shows up in Wind Waker.

We have an origin story for Tingle in Freshly Picked Tingle’s Rosy Rupeeland.

He starts to get the taste *mwah* I love rupees.

And then he starts selling his maps to you in Majora’s Mask, but at the same time as

Rosy Rupeeland is the Dekisugi Tingle Pack, which was, uh, DSiWare, and it just basically

was like a calculator, and like a fortune teller or something.

Tingle’s Balloon Fight DS.

This happens at the same time as Wind Waker.

Over here in “Basketball” timeline, we’ve got Ripened Tingle’s Balloon Trip of Love.

I’m not gonna explain how it connects just yet, because I’ll do that later.

It’s the final Zelda spinoff.

Hyrule Warriors Definitive Edition, and I’m using the definitive edition because that’s

just the collection of all of them, ‘cause there’s three different versions of this game.

I’m gonna put Hyrule Warriors over here, and I’m gonna call this the TIME BREAK.

*THE TIME BREAK*

They made three timelines already, so why can’t I make my own?

Hyrule Warriors is the second most important game in the entire timeline for how it ties

everything together.

Hyrule Warriors.

Think about that, Nintendo!

You made me care about Hyrule Warriors!

But we’re not done with Zelda games.

We’re gonna talk about Zelda character appearances.

If Miyamoto doesn’t, like, email me after this video goes up and say, “Brian, you’ve

cracked the code!”

I’m never gonna play another Zelda game ever again.

This whole goddamn suit is so tight, I feel like a Christmas ham.

I haven’t connected these two right now, because in “Adult Link” timeline, Link

just kinda slacks off, ‘cause he has, again, existential crisis.

He finished beating Ganon, what does he do for the rest of his life?

I’ll tell you what he does: He go-karts, and he fights people…

FOR SPORT.

Super Smash Bros. the original one, Mario Kart 8, and Soulcalibur II.

Got nothing better to do, might as well go have fun, and you know what, I respect that,

but you did forget that Ganondorf got resurrected, and then the whole world flooded.

So that’s on your conscience.

I imagine that Link still has, like, access to the Temple of Time, which is why in Super

Smash Bros. Melee, it happens simultaneously in Ocarina of Time, because he can change

himself into Young Link, and also Ganondorf’s there, and I don’t know why he’s allowed

to fight.

I’ve put these three Super Smash Bros. after Hyrule Warriors in the TIME BREAK.

*TIME BREAK*

And while we’re hanging out in the time break…

Sonic’s here.

Sonic’s in the time break baby!

I swear to god I’m not just using the time break as a catch-all, but it does work as

a catch-all.

There’s this weird-ass game for the Wii called Captain Rainbow.

Technically happens at the same time as Link’s Awakening because it includes Crazy Tracy,

but Link’s Awakening happens within Link’s dream, so that means that Captain Rainbow

might be happening within Crazy Tracy’s dream.

So it’s very much like Inception.

And that means that Joseph Gordon Levitt exists in the Zelda timeline.

That’s a joke.

Joseph Gordon Levitt doesn’t exist in any timeline.

And these are also gonna come down here next to Ripened Tingle’s Balloon Trip of Love.

WarioWare, all of them, and then Scribblenauts Unlimited.

And again, I will explain that later.

Phew, I’m getting too worked up about this.

Canonical games, spin-offs, Zelda appearances in other games, what’s left?

Every other type of media.

I swear to god if I get one “well actually…” comment.

That’s a lost cause, right?

Let’s start with books.

I mentioned before that Skyward Sword was not the first game and that Game & Watch was

the first game.

But it’s not the first instance of Zelda and Link.

Himekawa’s Skyward Sword manga does include the origin of literally… it’s like the

first Avatar, it’s the first Link, first Hylian chosen hero.

First instance of Link.

I really don’t know why Nintendo hasn’t included the choose-your-own-adventure books

because they love to have things that have confusing timelines where Link could potentially

die in them, like in “Basketball” over there.

The Crystal Trap and The Shadow Prince happen canonically after the original Legend of Zelda

and Zelda II.

There are, like, 11 or 12 or 18 different endings.

Stick with me here: you could win The Shadow Prince with high points or you could win The

Shadow Prince with lower points.

Those are two separate timelines in my head.

So low points from The Shadow Prince, you go to the Valiant Comics, and now we’re

gonna talk about TV.

If you win with high points, we go into The Legend of Zelda TV Series.

“Aren’t I sweet?”

After The Legend of Zelda TV Series, Captain N happens, and it’s weird because in this

one, the hero is a guy named Kevin.

He gets sucked into a television.

Captain N creates this potential option of being able to summon yourself into the game,

which explains THESE THREE THINGS.

I TOLD YOU I WOULD EXPLAIN THEM LATER!

Ripened Tingle’s Balloon Trip of Love starts with a dumb 35-year-old man who lives in his

parents’ house and then he gets sucked into a book, and then he goes into Tingle’s land

and he becomes Tingle.

WarioWare shows that the Zelda games exist at the same time which is in Captain N, and

also Scribblenauts Unlimited is here, too!

I haven’t necessarily figured that one out.

Board games!

There are Zelda board games, and they also deserve to be in the timeline.

The Legend of Zelda board game…

The Zelda board game happens if you die in The Crystal Trap, how does that sound?

Alright?

You happy?

But what about Zelda Clue?

That’s…

I guess, happens, uh, during the Super Smash Bros. time, right?

Because they’re having fun together, hanging out.

Zelda Chess!

*exasperated look at the camera*

There’s no plotline in Zelda Chess.

Put it in Ocarina of Time like everything else in this dumbass timeline.

Let me double check that I’ve gotten everything…

But what about the TIME BREAK?

*TIME BREAK*

I told you that I would explain the time break, didn’t I?

And I’m gonna explain it right now.

Why does no one understand the time break except for me, Brian David Gilbert?

Why am I the only scholar in time break studies?

I’ll tell you why.

Hyrule Warriors Definitive Edition happens outside of the timeline entirely, similarly

to Breath of the Wild.

It exists in all of the timelines because Ganondorf’s soul gets split into multiple

pieces that go into different timelines, and again, that’s in the story itself.

Link figures out that there are multiple timelines in this time.

And then he defeats the thing and he goes into existential crisis mode, just like over

here, and like over here, and like over there.

But what does he do when he knows that all of these timelines exist?

He goes and plays Super Smash Bros. with all of his friends in every single timeline.

That’s how Super Smash Bros.

Ultimate can exist, because it’s everyone, all the time, everywhere, and also Sonic!

But the time break still doesn’t fit in.

It’s still by itself over here, right?

Okay, the time break doesn’t have a space.

Link knows about every timeline, and he’s done hanging out with his friends here in

the time break, so what does he do?

He decides to settle down, get a real job.

And what can he do better than anyone else?

That’s right, he knows every location in every timeline.

I’m talking location, location, location.

HE GETS HIS REAL ESTATE LICENSE.

He buys up every land, he consolidates every timeline and pushes it all into one space.

How does he do it?

LEGEND OF ZELDA MONOPOLY.

THE MOST IMPORTANT LEGEND OF ZELDA GAME OF ALL TIME.

THE ONE THAT MAKES BREATH OF THE WILD MAKE SENSE.

REGGIE: TAKE FUCKING NOTES.

I JUST SAVED YOUR ASS WITH MONOPOLY.

THIS IS THE PIN THAT HOLDS THE ENTIRE ZELDA TIMELINE TOGETHER.

YOU MADE ME USE MONOPOLY!

That’s the entire Zelda timeline, including 55 pieces

of Zelda media.

Don’t ask me to do this again.

King Koopa.

The authoritarian turtle with a penchant for princess-napping.

His very name strikes fear into the heart of man and mushroom alike.

And he’s also pretty good at figure skating.

But when you focus on Bowser’s many attempts to put the Mushroom Kingdom under his rule,

you might forget that to order fuel his violent vanity projects,

he must put hundreds of henchmen into harm’s way.

And by harm’s way, I mean in front of Mario.

But me?

I never forget the troops.

And today I’m honoring those who have put their lives on the line for a megalomaniacal turtle.

Today, I’m presenting you with Bowser’s military hierarchy.

I can’t go any further than that, I’m sorry.

“But Brian,” I hear you ask, “Why does Bowser need a military hierarchy?”

And folks, I hear you.

I hear your questions constantly.

They come to me in my dreams like a prophet receiving visions from an angry god.

Bowser needs a military hierarchy because of the Geneva Conventions.

Y’all remember those things?

Those little rules that keep you from committing war crimes?

Look, I know Bowser is a bad dude, but I don’t think that Nintendo would actively create

a war criminal and then allow him to sit in the backseat of a go-kart with a baby.

This is thanks to how we define armed conflict.

I read through the entirety of the Geneva Conventions in order to find this information,

which turned out to be unnecessary because there is a far more succinct definition in

a far shorter paper.

But do I regret reading the Geneva Conventions?

Of course not.

Knowledge is its own reward.

And could I really call this an Unraveled if I didn’t spend a whole day reading 224

pages of dense legalese for no good reason?

Of course I couldn’t.

Of course I couldn’t…

If Bowser wants to keep his armed conflict above board, we need to codify his aggressions.

So this means his henchmen need to follow a command structure.

One that is not at all clear cut in the games.

All we need is a list of Bowser’s troops.

That’s where this book comes in!

It’s The Super Mario Bros. Encyclopedia.

The official listing of everything you could ever want to know about the 17 games in the

main series of Super Mario Bros.

The main series are just the platformers, none of the RPGs or spin offs.

But the silver lining to this means that I can spend a different Unraveled talking about those games.

Because God has cursed me for my hubris, and my work is never finished.

Of the 17 in the main series, I’m gonna cut these three games, because they don’t

have Bowser as the main antagonist.

And I’m also gonna include Super Mario Odyssey, because that came out after this book was published.

That leaves us with 15 games and 226 enemies.

I came to this number because I cut out the variants.

I cut out all of the shadow versions of Mario, the minigame enemies, the enemies that are

just machines, and Bowser’s fursonas.

Because those should never be exposed to the horrors of war.

Now I need to figure out how to structure this hierarchy.

I asked myself, is there an analogous military that is somewhat bloated, often antagonistic,

and seems to be the only thing that the leadership cares about funding?

Unfortunately, I couldn’t find any real life examples of this.

So I’m loosely basing it on the US military.

That means Bowser’s military **SMACK*** will be split up into branches based on which

henchmen work best together, and I’m also going to try to fit them alongside commissioned

officers and enlisted troops.

The standard command structure that’s found in most militaries.

Let’s start with the heads of state: Obviously, we have Bowser up at the top, the commander in chief.

His secretary of defense is gonna be Kamek,

with Kamella standing by as the National Security Council.

We’ve also got Bowser Jr. up here, but he’s not in a military role.

He’s actually Secretary of Transportation.

But that’s just pure nepotism.

The rest of Bowser’s henchmen are going to fit into this hierarchy, and I’m just

gonna say one henchman per rank, the one that epitomizes what that rank means.

And I’m gonna list the rest of the enemies on the screen.

Because I do want to save at least a little bit of paper.

Uh.

Obviously I don’t want to save paper that much.

*paper guilt*

Starting with our infantry, we have our enlisted ranks with Private Goomba.

This makes sense.

It is the basic troop.

Moving up a step to the corporal, we’ve got the Galoomba.

It’s more mature than the Goomba.

And also, its name has an extra syllable and is way more fun to yell.

Pat: Look at this Galoomba!

Brian: LOOK AT THIS GALOOMBA!

Chargin’ Chuck is a great pick for sergeant class, because this troop obviously enlisted

right after being their high school star quarterback and moved up through the ranks quickly.

And now that we’re up at warrant officer, the top of the enlisted ranks.

We’ve got, it’s just a tower of Goombas.

Kind of like the Naval Academy’s Herndon Monument, Goombas become stronger and work

together better when they’re standing on top of one another.

Moving our way up to the commissioned officers, we start out with officer cadet.

And that’s gonna be Twirlip.

It’s got the round, soft body of a day one ROTC recruit,

but there’s ambition in those eyes.

Second lieutenant, we’ve got the Snailicorn.

It’s the natural evolution from the officer cadet, but a bit more dangerous.

By the time you’ve reached First Lieutenant, you’ve really proved your mettle and are

ready to show your dedication to the cause.

And what better way to show your dedication than to be literally shot from a cannon.

By the time you reach captain, you need to have a top-down perspective.

And that's why the Pokey's height is great for this rank.

Also, the Pokey understands how to take calculated losses in stride, like having literally all

of their torso punched out from under them and still maintaining a smile.

Next we have Major Squizzard, and I’m gonna gloss over him, 'cause his name makes me uncomfortable.

For lieutenant colonel, I chose Wiggler, because they're able to maintain composure and only

release their aggression when it's absolutely necessary.

But quick shout out to Stairface Ogre, who is also a lieutenant colonel and sounds like

he could be a member of the Wu Tang Clan.

Next, we have Colonel Spike.

At the colonel rank, you’re not only dealing with wartime issues, but also the internal

politics of the military,

which is why Spike makes time to have a few rounds of tennis with the boss.

A Brigadier General needs an eye for detail and a strong guiding hand.

And that's literally all Knucklotec is.

Major Burrows really deserves the rank of major general because he has demonstrated

a powerful understanding of many strategies in many different battle arenas.

But more than that, he has this tender leadership quality that makes him not only respected,

but loved by his peers.

And then above him is a fucking T-Rex.

Unfortunately, even the military hierarchy is not insulated from nepotism.

And though no one would describe Petey Piranha as capable in literally any circumstance,

his father took a bullet for Bowser back in the Korean War, so now he’s a general.

And finally, we have our field marshall, the five-star general.

Obviously, this person is going to oversee every aspect of Bowser's infantry, and it

has to be filled with the most overpowered troop.

So it's Ukiki.

This shitheel of a monkey plays dumb, but he’s the Sun Tzu of Bowser’s army.

Listen to these quotes:

And that is the basic structure of Bowser’s infantry, though there are also three special

divisions of infantry units that are trained to fight in different conditions.

The Lava and the Ice divisions are still found under Field Marshal Ukiki and they don't have

any enlisted troops.

I won't talk too much about these two, but I think they are epitomized by the Bully for

the Lava group, and the Chill Bully for the ice group, who is exactly like the Bully,

except he'll kind of go easy on you if he can tell you're having a rough day.

And the third special unit in the infantry is the spectral unit, or the Dry Corps, because

not even death can excuse you from service in Bowser's army.

I do want to talk about the implications of this unit for a moment.

Specifically Dry Bones and Dry Bowser, whose naming conventions confuse and frighten me.

When I die, will I become Dry Brian?

Is a living Bowser...

Wet Bowser?

Why do Piranha Plant have bone in it?

Next we have our aquatic troops.

Where can you find pleasure, search the world for treasure, learn science technology?

Um.

Where can you begin to make your dreams all come true, on the land or on the sea?

*SINGING* IN THE NAVY!

I won’t overstay my welcome on the naval forces because we already understand what

each of the ranks in the hierarchy entail.

But I did just want to point out one troop.

The Gushen.

Because its name is the Gushen.

And I had to learn that its name was the Gushen.

And now you need to know that it's called a Gushen as well.

And of course, the admiral of the fleet is going to be Unagi.

Because Unagi is the most terrifying character ever rendered.

Get fucked, Mr. X.

Now on to the Air Force, we start with the Paragoomba at our lowest rank.

And honestly, we're gonna skip ahead to wing commander, because most of the Air Force is

just infantry but with wings attached.

Lakitu is our wing commander.

You might remember him as that helpful guy who picks you up in Mario Kart.

But he actually got his start in carpet bombing.

And it might seem redundant to have Klepto as the marshal of the Air Force.

But if there's one strategy that Bowser's military understands better than anything else,

it's stealing hats.

And these are the branches of Bowser’s military.

Of course, there are also Special Forces.

Units that Bowser can send in when he needs something to be done quietly and cleanly.

Like when the he sent the Broodals to perform the extrajudicial killing of Professor E. Gadd.

Next we've got the Bros.

I'm talking the Hammer Bro, the Fire Bro, every bro in between.

You can learn more about them in the HBO series, Band of Brothers.

I assume.

I've never watched the show.

It’s time for the special forces called The Funny Parade!

It’s the Funny Parade!

You know about Thwomps, but did you know that there are Thwimps?

And the Whomps have Whimps?

Thwimps and Thwomps and Whimps and Whomps and Grindels and Spindels and Grrrols.

There's Tox Box and Flomps and Rhomps and Bomps and Walleyes and Wallops and

they're all pretty much invincible and they will crush you without hesitation

like a cartoonish Sherman’s March to the Sea.

Next, we've got the Koopalings.

They're sort of like the Seal Team 6 of Bowser's army.

Iggy, Larry, Lemmy, Roy, Wendy O., Ludwig Von.

Notice that I did not include Morton Koopa Jr., because despite what he has written in

his memoirs, he's never actually been active duty, and he’s a valor stealing bastard.

And the final special forces team.

It’s the Stus.

Strollin’ Stu (strollin' stu).

Soarin’ Stu (soarin' stu).

Swipin' Stu (swipin' stu).

Smolderin’ Stu (smolderin' stu).

*Pat laughs offscreen.*

I don’t know if they’re good at fighting

but they are good at being the best fucking characters in Mario.

And that is every troop in Bowser’s military.

Except for these six specific ones.

They didn't really fit in the military structure.

They don't act like military.

The Koopa Troopas from Super Mario 64, they don’t even antagonize you.

Like, they go about their business unless you go out of your way to attack them.

So, again, they don't even, like, feel like military.

Uh, they act more like civilians, to be honest.

*realizing an unfortunate truth*

Oh my god, they’re civilians.

Okay, so maybe reading the full Geneva Conventions wasn’t such an unnecessary thing after all.

There’s this thing called the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, and in

Article 8 Subsection 2, it states that grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions

count as war crimes.

And if these Koopa Troopas are in fact not Troopas, but civilians, and Mario kills them,

then that is a direct violation of Article 8 Part 2, subsection B, 1: (i) Intentionally

directing attacks at the civilian population...

Mario is a war criminal.

But that’s not the only breach, God no.

Subsection A 4: Extensive destruction and appropriation of property.

Destroying a brick to gain a coin.

Subsection A 5, Compelling a prisoner of war... to serve in the forces of a hostile Power.

What else could you call using Cappy to possess enemies

and then forcing them to fire on their own friends?

Subsection A 8, Taking of hostages.

What was Mario doing with that penguin child?

You might think, hey, maybe Mario's just become hardened after years of onslaught

by Bowser, but LOOK BACK TO MARIO’S YOUTH!

I know I didn’t include Yoshi’s Island in these lists of games, but Subsection B, 21:

Committing outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment.

Yoshi made Burt the Bashful’s pants fall down!

But Baby Mario gave the order.

He already feels bashful!

You didn't need to pants the man!

Mario has committed at least 5 war crimes,

and I’m not even including the child soldiers he has enlisted in the RPGs.

But luckily, I’ve already compiled an extensive PDF that I have just emailed to the Hague,

outlining Mario's crimes.

Still, it’s important to note that Bowser is also at fault.

The great loss of Goomba life is a tragedy, no matter which side you are on.

The true enemy is war itself.

And to fix that, we have to turn to the only thing that’s worked in the past.

Song.

One more time everyone!

We are the Toads.

We are the goombas.

So please stop jumping on each other, ya big Galoombas!

Why do we fight to take each others’ space, when there’s so mushroom to spare.

We could all have extra lives if we just share. 
 2020-06-25 16:20:08,557 - DEBUG - file running:  CASTLEVANIA!

One of my favorite game series of all time.

The myriad enemies you face in Dracula’s abode are made even better knowing that they

come from real mythology and folklore.

Wouldn’t it be nice if there was one place you could find the FULL BESTIARY of EVERY

MONSTER in Castlevania?

I think that would be nice.

OR AT LEAST I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE.

I swear to god, the first time I started filming this video, I thought it would be an easy

change of pace.

I mean, how many unique enemies could there really be in Castlevania?

100?

200?

How about more than 600.

So I booked 3 hours in this studio to film.

And then we ran out of time about halfway through.

So I went out to grab some lunch, but it start to rain, so I ate a chicken sandwich drenched.

That has nothing to do with the video, I just wanted you to know my pain.

So I had to start filming all over again, this time after hours in a random meeting

room in our office building.

And when I finished that, I had three and a half hours of footage that I was able to

whittle down into an hour long video that was very educational and extremely entertaining.

JUST KIDDING.

IT WAS BORING AS HELL.

But just when all hope seemed lost, I had an epiphany.

“I am going to throw myself into the sea.”

Luckily, before I could do that, my coworkers stopped me and convinced me that trying to

categorize all 600 Castlevania monsters was a bad idea, and instead, I could just pick the hot one.

Ask yourself, why are vampires always the hot monster?

Isn’t it someone else’s turn?

I’m here to answer that question now that I’m filming this video for the third time.

Be thankful that I’m not releasing an hour long video of me basically just lecturing

you on mythology.

I mean, who knows, maybe I’ll release that video some other time.

THAT WAS A JOKE.

I’M NOT GONNA DO THAT.

YOU’RE GONNA HAVE TO TRUST ME.

IT WAS A REALLY BAD VIDEO.

SO LET’S FIND CASTLEVANIA’S MOST ELIGIBLE BACHELOR!

*hot music*

*lonely squeaking*

Let’s cull down that list of over 600 enemies.

We’re gonna start by smooshing all of the ones with common mythologies into just one

enemy, so that way we don’t have to deal with the 96 different skeletons.

We're also going to go ahead and cut out the evil human beings, and that includes the Belmonts that

you fight as enemies, and also all of the vampires.

We all know that Dracula is hot.

We all know that Richter Belmont is hot.

I’m also going to go ahead and cut all of the enemies from Boku Dracula Kun, which was

just a spinoff series, and Getsu Fuma Den enemies, which only appeared in one stage

in Castlevania Harmony of Despair.

And now it’s time to cut the animals, mythical or otherwise.

Look, if they’re anthropomorphized sure, but for things like “Owl,” that’s not

a monster, that’s a bird.

What about ephemera like will o’ the wisps, or inanimate objects made animate, kind of

like golems or marionettes.

I went back and forth on whether or not to include these, and then I realized they creep

me out, so I cut them.

Now I’m going to cut out all of the gods and the god servants and the embodiments of

things like chaos and evil, because those are inherently unique.

I'm gonna cull this list a little bit more, because, let’s be honest, vampires aren’t the only monsters

that have had a taste *kiss* of that sexy limelight.

Witches and warlocks, zombie, orc, treant, werewolf, mermen, gargoyle, gremlin, ghosts,

Medusa, cyclops, yeti, fox archer, ogres, stained glass knight, from Young Sherlock

Holmes, where he appeared as the first photorealistic CGI in any movie back in 1985.

And finally, mummies, Brendan Fraser.

Wasn’t the mummy in the film, but he’s sexy enough that just by association.

But we’ve culled it down to the perfect number to figure out our sexy monster.

That’s right.

We’ve got 69 left.

Can I get a WOOP?

Patrick: Woo!

Clayton: woo.

We’ll work on it, Clayton.

Criteria for what makes a sexy monster: Number one, is it replicable.

I’ve already explained this, it can’t be a unique monster.

Anything unique can be sexy.

Look at Benedict Cumberbatch.

Number two, is it datable?

Can you have a conversation with this monster?

Can you bring it to Applebee’s?

And number three, can this monster…

GET IT?

We're gonna start with the viable ones that probably aren’t the best sex icons, like Mimic, which

is kind of a veiny blob.

The Two Headed Creature.

Part cyclops, part werewolf, all bad.

Wight, W.I.G.H.T.

comes from the old English term meaning human being.

It’s like a… just a blue zombie.

Necromancers…

I don’t know, they’re into weird shit.

Spriggans come from Cornish faery lore, and they are described as old, wizened men with

huge childlike heads, uh, which someone’s into, I’m sure.

Nominon is a beast that, like, sucks the dreams out of your brains.

And that’s not a very supportive partner.

Punaguchi is just a large protruding mouth.

I don’t want to know what that mouth do.

The Maneating Plant, the Wakwak Tree, and the Human Face Tree are all plants.

So if you would want to make the monster sexy, it would just… it’s just a plant.

The rug creature.

Uh, you never actually see what it is, it’s just always under the rug.

Which means it’s probably just like a cat.

Hearteater.

If you’re into bad boys.

Castlevania has some of the best design in any pixel art game, except for the Towers Guardian.

I don’t know what the hell this is.

A ghoul isn’t necessarily a zombie, it is something that eats corpses, which is just gross.

This one’s for the sapiosexuals out there… the Brain Float.

Alastor: you should be wary of anyone who builds their personality around swords.

Elementals are just embodiments of fire and frost.

Just hard to cuddle with.

The Legend of Zeldo.

It’s just a person with scythes.

They are also known by the name “the Night Stalker,” which is a big red flag.

The Kyoma Demon hangs out in mirrors and jumps out and scares you, uh, and I don’t need

anymore reason to be afraid of looking at myself in the mirror.

*pensive music*

Man Beast comes in two forms: twink and twunk.

They say that eye contact is important.

But maybe not this much.

I do think we need a sexy skeleton, and the epitome of skeleton in this game is Yorick.

Yorick comes from Hamlet, the famous soliloquy “Alas, poor Yorick.”

In the Japanese version, he isn’t called Yorick, he’s called Soccer Boy.

The Imp is a mischievous sprite.

And I was a bit worried about size differentials, but then I remembered Bee Movie, where a human

woman falls in love with a bee.

Jerry Seinfeld taught me that through love all things are possible.

Trolls.

It’s time for someone to give them the love they deserve.

The next monster is Evil Force.

And I want you to just go ahead and wipe away all preconceived notions.

Obviously, the name makes it sound bad.

Uh.

It also is terrible.

(Pat laughs off camera).

Edimmu are Mesopotamian demons that come back from the dead when they weren’t buried correctly,

which seems like super high maintenance.

The Slaughterer apparently skips leg day.

The Arthroverta.

Just a human face plastered on top of, like, an arthropod. I dunno, maybe?

Chon Chon, or the Bitterfly, comes from Chile.

It’s about Mapuche wizards that turn into this thing.

Kind of like vampires turning into bats.

It’s a neat talent.

*revealing my true Chon Chon form*

The Killer Mantle.

Comes from an urban legend in Japan about Aka Manto, which is a spirit that lives in

toilets and then asks you if you want red or blue toilet paper.

Red, they’ll stab you in the back a bunch, and blue, they’ll strangle you till you

turn blue.

I’m just not into toilet stuff.

I mean most of these monsters are pretty okay.

Um, they’re not the… they’re not like the most.

SURPRISE!

I LULLED YOU INTO A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY!

It’s time for a minigame I like to call, “If I were a Castlevania game... what title

would I be?”

Take your birth month, and that’s the first part of the title.

OF.

And your birth date is the second part.

My title would be Castlevania: Sonata of the Eclipse.

All of these games sound the same.

We’re halfway through the viable enemies.

We’ve got 35 monsters that I think are pretty good options.

We’re gonna start with the monsters that are supposed to be sexy, so it feels kind

of unfair to use them as the sexy monsters.

Lorelai, Lilith, and all of the succubi, Harpys, Headhunter, Arachnes, Dryads, Rusalka, and Naiads.

I’m just putting these ones all around the sides.

The demons.

The ones with the horns and the wings and they’re really ripped and muscular.

Mothman.

Everyone thinks the Mothman is pretty sexy.

Although this Jersey Devil depiction looks just kind of like a horse with wings, uh,

the actual Jersey Devil comes from an idea of a woman who cursed her 13th child, being like,

“UGH GOD I GOTTA HAVE ANOTHER BABY.”

And then it came out and it grew like a goat’s face and wings, and I just think we need to

start thinking of New Jersey in general as sexier.

And this might be the way to do that.

The Minotaur.

You gotta work through that labyrinth, but once you get in there and find the real Minotaur,

he might kill you.

But, he also might open up and be really lovely.

The Chupacabra is an impish little fella.

First sighted in Puerto Rico and is known throughout lots of Latin America.

His name translates to goat sucker.

Do I have to explain why...

The Fomorians are personifications of chaos and other evil ideas in Irish folklore.

Um, and they're these goat people, uh, and they're ripped as hell.

Lizard Man.

If you don't know why I'm putting this here.

*COME ON*

You gotta go what my Skyrim video.

Banshee comes from Irish folklore and will foretell the death of someone you know.

It's a bit spooky.

It's also super emotionally available.

You won't have to worry about what the Banshee is thinking.

They will tell you when they're upset.

And also when your parents are gonna die.

Slogra.

Doesn't have a folklore or mythology associated with it.

I got nothing for ya.

If you're not attracted to this, you're wrong.

Because the Rycuda only exists in Castlevania, it means that there's... very specific artwork

that you can find of it.

Very modern artwork has been made about the Rycuda, which proves it can be sexy.

Dullahan is an Irish faery that is like a headless horseman sort of character, it's

also another portent of death, but can you think about all the cool Spider-Man kisses

you can do with that?

The Jiang Shi is the Qing dynasty version of a vampire.

Keremet comes out when you bang on his pot a couple times.

It's a good face, right?

I could talk to that thing for hours.

There are so many armors in Castlevania.

No one can turn down a man in uniform.

Or a poltergeist in uniform.

Or literally just an enchanted uniform.

UGHHHHHHH MOTHER OF PEARL I forgot about goblins.

Everyone forgets about goblins though, so I'll put 'em over here!

I also forgot about Siren, that's another thing that's sexy and draws people in.

How did I skip so many of these?

The Guillotiner doesn't look like much, could be a problem, but it's time for us to bring it back.

Slime.

There are already things online.

The Tsuchinoko is a Japanese cryptid that is a snake that is fatter in its middle than

on its head or its tail.

Pat (off camera): I just don't see why it's sexy.

You don't...

Patrick, you gotta understand.

It's not about what you could first see, right?

Pat: I mean, but even after that, what do you see after that?

It has a propensity for lying and for drinking alcohol.

Patrick thinks it shouldn't be this high on the list, but fuck Patrick.

We're at the top five.

But before we get there, um, I have a confession to make.

I've kept six monsters that don't even fit my criteria, but I love them so much that

I think they deserve a chance.

First up is a unique character, it's Nergal Meslamstea.

The reason I think he deserves a chance is because is because someone named him Nergal

Meslamstea.

Of course he's gonna be fucking evil if you name your child...

Why, what is up with people in Castlevania naming their children dumb shit?

Seriously, Alucard?

Dracula, you can't just name your child your name backwards.

I'm not gonna name my son Nairb.

Scary Candle.

It's an inanimate object that is made animate, but I fucking love candles.

Next two I think are pretty self explanatory: Bone Pillar.

And if that doesn't make you happy, how 'bout the Bone Dragon?

This next one is a ghost, and I've already explained why that one shouldn't be included

in this, but I had to because the ghost's name is Duke Mirage.

And if someone comes up to me and introduces themself to me as Duke Mirage,

my pants are already off.

Finally, I know I nixed all animals.

But I really do think we should include Hyena with gun.

That hyena can GET IT.

We're at the top five.

The Malebranche come from Dante's Divine Comedy.

They're all unique demons that are used to help keep corrupt politicians under boiling

pits of tar in Hell.

They all have great names like Cagnazzo and Scarmiglione, which was translated into the

English version as Skull Millione, which is just a Soundcloud rapper.

They're already mischievous, and they hate corrupt politicians.

We can get behind that.

The Myconid is a sentient race of mushroom people.

We have anthropomorphized animalia, why not anthropomorphized fungi?

When I was a kid, my mom thought that I had a nutritional deficit because I kept wanting

to eat mushrooms so much, like I ate only mushrooms for like a whole week.

That has nothing to do with this.

I know I took out all of the werewolf creatures, uh, but this one isn't that.

This is the Princess of Moss.

The human version is based off of

PFBRRRRRRRR UHM OFF WITH THE-ERRR Let them eat cake?

(Pat: Mary Antoinette) Mary Antoinette.

I think we should have more moth creatures in our movies.

Right?

They're already drawn towards the limelight.

It's an Ukoback.

Why is this the second sexiest monster from Castlevania?

I'll tell you why.

He carries around a hot thing of coals in a spoon, and is also responsible not only

for fried foods, but fireworks.

HELL YES.

What a cool dude!

I think Ukobacks could be real sexy, right?

What is more sexy than feeding someone with a lovely fried dish?

And finally, the thing that I think should be new sexy monster.

The Mandrake.

Or the Alura Une.

Basically, any sort of plant person.

Alura Une actually comes from a 1911 book called "Alraune."

It's a German story.

I just think that this kind of gives you a blank slate on something, sure this, this

thing is born from the ground where hanged men bleed, which is spooky, and scary, but

it's not their fault!

Right?

You know, they didn't choose to be born.

Who does choose to be born?

Right?

Who chooses...

The metaphors of how our family raises us, you know, the mandrake is a perfect idea of

something that can become greater than its original circumstances.

*SIGH* So there you go.

The full bestiary of the sexy monsters.

Again, couldn't give you the full full bestiary, because that took me way too long.

And if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw myself into the ocean now.

I CAN'T DO THAT.

I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE COLD BUT I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS GOING TO BE THAT COLD.

Make sure to like this video and subscribe to Polygon if you want to see more Unraveled,

and go ahead and leave a comment of your new Castlevania title.

Maybe that'll convince them to make a new game. 
 2020-06-25 16:20:08,558 - DEBUG - file running:  Welcome to Unraveled Season 2!

You can tell it’s a new season because I’ve grown a mustache and cut my hair.

Ohoho I’m obviously just kidding.

These are both fake.

I know how much it would disappoint my friends if I changed my appearance.

I'm just kidding again.

I'm not your friend, and you have no say over what I do with my body.

And speaking of harsh realities...

The world of Dark Souls is frightening and murky.

How can you truly understand Dark Souls lore without living Dark Souls?

Grinding away tirelessly in inhospitable environments, under uncharitable overlords.

To truly understand Dark Souls lore, you must first understand the desolation of…

Working at a job!

Have you ever thought about the term Boss in a video game before?

Those terrible enemies have the same title as the people you’ll be working for

for the rest of your life!

Haha, what a silly coincidence!

Dark Souls is known for wildly difficult bosses that prove themselves on the battlefield,

but can they prove themselves in a more difficult setting:

the Lordran Hills Business Park and Commerce Center!

It’s across from the mall.

Today, I’m ranking every Dark Souls boss based on how good they’d be as a manager.

I'm not dancing this season.

Welcome to the Dark Souls Corp. onboarding seminar.

Now I'm only going to be speaking about the Dark Souls 1, 2, and 3 bosses.

No other “Soulsborne” games.

I was originally thinking about putting in the Demon's Souls, but they actually got integrated

into the Dark Corporation in a very messy merger.

All of the managers got sacked.

So we're not talking about them.

That leaves us with 96 Dark Souls bosses and minibosses.

And it leads us to the difficult part of our journey, how do we objectively answer the

subjective question: “What makes a good boss?”

So I started researching lists of “the x qualities of a good boss” on places like

LinkedIn and Forbes, and then I fell down the rabbit hole of the hundreds of corporate blogs.

And at the end of this journey, I realized... it didn't matter at all.

What does matter is making a catchy, powerpointable mnemonic device.

So here are the Five Cs that make a good boss:

Number one, clear vision.

Can this boss communicate their goals, give clear steps on how to achieve those goals.

Does this boss clearly hold their big old arm way up in the air before slamming it down on you?

Number two, consistent feedback.

It’s important for a boss to let you know that you’ve made a mistake, like challenging

Seath the Scaleless before putting on your ring of sacrifice, you absolute fool.

You child.

Number three, cherishes employees.

A good boss values employee perspectives and rewards good performance.

Like when a boss decides to die when you hit it in a good way.

Number four, compassionate leadership.

Honest. Trusting.

Worthy of respect from their employees.

The kind of boss you could chat with at the Estus cooler.

And the fifth and final C. Can really just go to town on a motherfucker.

Slices.

Dices.

Big old crunchers.

Someone who’s willing to do what needs to be done when the going gets tough.

Or someone who reveals an abyssal dragon that they’ve been keeping under their armor this whole time.

This is our main criteria for what makes a good boss.

But for 96 bosses, it's gonna be hard to differentiate their management style with just these five Cs.

Which is why I’m introducing the HR index.

If they're over here, they get a lot of HR compliments.

If they're down here, they get a lot of HR complaints.

Let’s be honest, some really well-loved bosses are very bad leaders, and some really good leaders

are SKEEZY AS HELL.

So let's rank some DARK SOULS BOOOOOSSEEEEEEEEES.

Here's our scale.

We're gonna start out with the neutrals.

They're the standard boss, so I'm just gonna skim through them.

Guardian Dragon, The Pursuer, Old Demon King, Demon of Song.

If you're watching this video and you see yourself exhibiting these lackluster tendencies,

I want you to ask yourself: What can I do to be better than the Royal Rat Authority,

who vomits acid all over the floor multiple times a day and is still considered a pretty

okay boss.

Aim higher.

Let's talk about the pushovers!

Now, these are like my favorite substitute teacher in high school, Mr. S,

who would go off on class-long tangents about his youth traveling the world

instead of teaching us about Lord of the Flies.

I loved Mr. S.

Objectively a terrible teacher, though.

Champion's Gravetender and Gravetender Greatwolf.

This guy’s so fun!

He brought his dog into work!

I love dogs!

Literally nothing's going to get done today.

Vordt of the Boreal Valley.

He runs around on all fours.

He's really disrupting the “walking” space.

It’s very ineffective.

Iron Golem.

He’s sweet, sort of bumbling, and you’ve asked him to approve your expense reports

like five times already.

Aava, Lud, and Zallen, the King's Pets.

Literally baked into the title, they're teacher's pets.

They suck up to the king.

Seath the Scaleless is a real sweetheart, but he is very risk averse.

And if you destroy his crystal, he becomes mortal, and takes it, like, really personally.

The Fume Knight.

He’s got two sides, two swords.

Look, he's still got his old sword back when he had your job.

But eventually he is gonna get rid of that sword.

He's gonna be a real asshole about it.

The Lost Sinner.

She, and I quote, “eternally punishes herself for the sins of her past.”

It’s important to have a boss that recognizes their flaws, but it's bad if your boss locks

herself in the conference room and flogs herself eternally.

I booked the conference room for three, I need to get in there.

Crossbreed Priscilla goes invisible at the first sign of conflict.

That's not showing up for the company.

Lorian and Lothric the princes.

One of them hangs around the other one's neck of the other one, who's actually doing all the work.

Which is the worst form of micromanaging.

The Four Kings.

You don't fight all four at once.

You fight one and then the rest come in slowly.

Which is kind of like every group project you had in high school.

The Carthus Sand Worm.

If you ignore them, they'll ignore you, and some people like that managing style.

But also if you stand on the sideline for long enough, someone else will shoot big arrows

into them and then they'll die.

And that's a bad boss.

The Dragonslayer Armour is actually just a puppet for these big wiry dragon butterfly things.

So they're well-loved by the higher ups, but only because they don't have any ideas on their own.

The Ancient Wyvern is the epitome of pushover.

Because you can just run through his stage and then kill him with one attack at the very end.

This is perfect for the employee that likes to, you know, fuck around on Reddit all day

and then send one email at five and then peace out.

I don't know what that's like.

I've never done that.

And finally, this is sort of a technical pushover.

It's the Ruin Sentinels.

They're kind of like a board of directors in that they all look the same and do the

same thing, which is to say not a lot.

But you gotta suck up to them if you want to get anywhere in the company.

Now we're gonna flip to the opposite side of the scale.

We're gonna talk about the sketchies.

These have a powerful understanding of corporate leadership...

but everyone hates them.

The Boreal Outrider Knight is a miniboss, but like, you can tell he really wants to be a boss.

Nashandra tricks you into opening the Throne of Want even though she just wants it for herself.

But manipulation gets you pretty far in business.

The Burnt Ivory King only comes to fight you after you kill literally all of his knights.

He gets it done, sure, but only when he needs to.

Dragonrider.

This dude doesn't have a dragon.

His job title is obviously false.

It's like if I got promoted to "Guy who had an okay time in high school."

Bed of Chaos.

Actually a very effective leader, but every time you have to have

a "Meeting with the Bed of Chaos,"

someone in HR gets an email.

Centipede Demon.

He nasty.

Manus, the Father of the Abyss.

Always screaming at me.

Bad anger management.

High Lord Wolnir has a lot of gold jewelry.

Very ostentatious.

All of his plans sound more like schemes,

BUT!

He does know the bassist for Maroon 5 and they've been looking for someone with like

really good hand dexterity and he's noticed that you've got something good so if you want...

Mytha, the Baneful Queen doesn't really have an understanding of personal boundaries.

She's kind of like that coworker who, instead of sending an email,

just peeks their head over the cubicle wall.

Except in this case that head is severed from the body and will explode.

Pinwheel can summon an unlimited amount of clones.

Most bosses wish they could be everywhere at once.

This one can be.

Slave Knight Gael came into the company with you, was a really good friend, and then he

got promoted over you, and he's been a real jerk since.

Aldia, Scholar of the First Sin is constantly testing you, because he sees great things in you.

But dude, not everything has to be a test.

This is a Game Stop.

Aldrich, Devourer of Gods has a bunch of skeletons strewn about his clothes, and those are the

people he ate on his way to the top.

Which is incredibly cutthroat, but at least he’s honest about it.

Pontiff Sulyvahn has two swords: a profane flame and a sword of judgment.

And he hits you with both of them.

He's the type of guy who sends you an NSFW link at work

and then reports you for clicking on it.

Dragon Slayer Ornstein and Executioner Smough get shit DONE.

They are a power couple...

that isn't sanctioned by HR.

They didn't fill out the paperwork.

It makes everyone very uncomfortable.

There is a LOT of PDA.

And it is weird.

Now let's move on to the good category, with the Old Dragonsl...

THIS IS JUST ORNSTEIN AGAIN.

THIS DUDE JUST PUT ON A DIFFERENT SUIT AND TRIED TO GET REHIRED IN THE OGDEN BRANCH.

That's not gonna fly!

Y’all ready for the stinkers?

You thought we had some pretty bad bosses up to this point, but we haven't even hit

the depths of bad bossery.

We're about to hit the Blighttown of HR.

Vendrick.

Dude, you gotta wear more than a loincloth to work.

Chaos Witch Quelaag and Scorpioness Najka are nude from the waist up...

and nude from the waist down.

Y'all, we have leftover shirts from the softball game, can you just go into the bathroom and

put one of those on, please?

Old Iron King is constantly working from home and he signs all of his emails,

"Sent from my hot tub."

GET OUT OF THE HOT TUB!

Ceaseless Discharge.

The name alone tells me you should have taken a sick day.

Oceiros, the Consumed King is always going on about his son Ocelotte,

showing you pictures of him and his rowing team.

You KNOW that this psych major is gonna replace you as soon as he graduates Yale.

Asylum Demon, Stray Demon, Demon Firesage all have a move called butt slam.

*camera nods in agreement*

Looking Glass Knight.

Reflects everyone's flaws back on them, doesn't look inward enough.

Curse-rotted Greatwood.

Another dress code violation.

Gwyn, Lord of Cinder is kept around because he was the founder and made a lot of money

on Wall Street in the '80s, but he’s hollow inside.

The Covetous Demon is always taking credit for the work that you're doing.

And he steals your lunch from the fridge every day, even though I label it, DAVE.

Abyss Watchers.

Infighting is a very dangerous thing for a group of managers.

The Crystal Sage does a little bit of work, and then vanishes, and then does a little bit more work,

and then vanishes, and then you see them on their instagram story at some beer garden.

Sister Friede is actually a very good boss, and should be up here, but unfortunately

she's the assistant to Father Ariandel

who is SO incompetent he can't untie a chair from his ass.

And finally, the worst boss...

The Gaping Dragon.

Under no circumstances should you be in a work setting

and described as gaping.

All that's left is the top right of this scale, the good bosses, but before we get there,

there are a few bosses that don't really fit into the standard "boss/employee" structure,

or they're basically corporations in their own right, so we'll talk about them as alternatives.

The Bell and the Belfry Gargoyles only come in when someone else is hurting.

So they're kind of like consultants.

Halflight, Spear of the Church could actually be a real-life human player.

And pitting employees against each other is a big no-no.

The Royal Rat Vanguard is one boss rat that's surrounded by a horde of indistinguishable other rats,

so it's just an episode of Undercover Boss.

Afflicted Graverobber, Ancient Soldier Varg, and Cerah the Old Explorer are a trio that...

like, they're just high school friends that decided to get together and open a burger joint,

and they're kind of incompetent but you love them anyway.

The Prowling Magus and Congregation is a startup because it's one charismatic weirdo who takes

credit for all of the hardworking people around them.

We've got some unions!

A good union would be the Skeleton Lords.

It's three lords and a bunch of minions who are recognized and working together toward

the same goal.

That's a good thing.

A worse union is the Deacons of the Deep, where the management only comes in

after five of their employees are killed.

Finally, we have the Executioner's Chariot, whose employees are trying to unionize,

but they keep getting trampled.

And that leaves us with the good ones.

There are only 13 of them.

The Flexile Sentry.

Great multitasker.

The Taurus Demon gives you the tools you need to succeed, and encourages you to climb that ladder,

so that way you can jump down and hit him on the head.

Gravelord Nito has a lot of skeleton friends.

A very good delegator.

The Duke's Dear Freja.

Yeah, she's a big spider...

but she's the Duke's DEAR Freja!

The Duke loves her!

When has the Duke led you astray before?

Come on, man!

The Duke loves her!

Give her a chance!

Pat (offscreen): Do it for the Duke!

Do it for the Duke!

Sinh, the Slumbering Dragon and the Last Giant are slow, deliberate, and they keep on going

even though they got a big fucking spear through 'em.

Elana, the Squalid Queen summons friends when things get a bit too much for her.

That’s good delegation and understanding your limits.

The Ancient Dragon doesn't actually fight you until you fight them, you can just have

a chat with this boss, and honestly, that's good enough sometimes.

Great Grey Wolf Sif is a big wolf with a sword.

FUCK YEAH!

The Nameless King and the King of the Storm.

Now, when the King of the Storm takes enough damage,

the Nameless King will put them out of their misery.

And it's very sad, but it's also what needed to be happen.

That's good management.

I fully expect my boss, Tara Long, to put me out of my misery when I stop being useful.

The Soul of Cinder.

If you kill him, you might become him.

And that's a very clear path to promotion.

It’s not a great path to promotion, but it is a clear one.

The Throne Watcher and Defender are another power couple, but they filled out the HR paperwork.

And they work great together!

They're super professional about it.

They constantly revive the other one when they die, and that's a good boss.

Also, relationship goals.

And finally, the best business boss in Dark Souls...

is The Rotten.

Because this company is employee owned.

Every movement is made by the collective.

Everyone gets a say.

Now you might think you are small, and insignificant,

and also dead.

But!

When you smash together everyone’s stinky, rotting corpse, you can move mountains together.

The best boss is you.

And all of your dead friends.

And in the Dark Souls Corporation, that means you need a job description.

So go ahead and use this handy chart to figure out your Dark Souls boss title.

And that concludes our onboarding seminar.

Make sure to print out your completion certificate at the end of this video

so you can send it to your manager.

Happy managing, and praise the sun!

Under no circumstances should you be in a work setting and described as gaping.

Pat (offscreen): Hey, yo, can I gape in here?

Brian (offscreen, laughing): You guys mind if I gape?

And that concludes our onboarding seminar.

Make sure to celebroderadfjoisfjid.

(Pat cracking up offscreen). 
 2020-06-25 16:20:08,558 - DEBUG - file running:  E3.

The Electronic Entertainment Expo.

What began as a humble video game industry trade show has blossomed into something more

spectacular.

More flamboyant.

More… of whatever this is.

E3 is a chance to show off new games and the theatrical chops of your executives.

Because that’s what E3 really is now.

It’s theater.

It’s like Cats the musical but with more guns and a better plot line.

But this E3 is different.

A lot of companies are ditching the press conference altogether, and those companies

are cowards.

Sony isn’t even showing up to E3 this year!

And it’s not because they lack things to say.

It’s because they have forgotten how to say it.

The industry has lost its way.

That’s why I’ll be giving them the 10 keys to creating a perfect E3 presentation,

and then I’ll be giving you the perfect E3 presentation.

It’s theatre, baby!

The first step is throwing away everything you know about public speaking, because E3

presentations are a beast of their own.

You have to watch them to learn from them.

You might ask, "Brian, wouldn’t learning from old E3s keep you in the rut of old thinking,

making the same mistakes that past business geniuses have made?"

No.

And that brings us to the board.

I have watched hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours of E3

presentations and I have analyzed what makes them compelling.

I’ve distilled the essence of E3 down into 10 simple keys.

If you include these 10 keys, you will create the perfect E3 presentation.

And if you, like most people, aren’t putting on an E3 press conference, then you could

potentially use these 10 keys for like a drinking game or something, I’m not saying you should

do that, I’m saying it’s y… it’s possible.

You could do that if you wanted t… it’s not…

I did that, okay?

You can use these for the drinking game.

The first key: A weirdly high-budget opener.

It is essential to start the presentation with high energy, and it’s essential to

do it in such a way as to make the audience say,

“Hmm yeah wow they really paid for that, huh?”

Sony used to be great at this, starting 2016’s E3 with an entire orchestra playing the God

of War theme, and then last year they started E3 with an entire banjo player.

Weird thing to spend money on.

But both of these intros still get BONUS POINTS, because they started with a live musical number.

The second key is for the presenter.

They have the unenviable task of connecting with a notoriously difficult audience.

How can they reach the fickle gamer while still maintaining business poise?

Business Gamer Fashion.

Business Gamer Fashion is an outfit that is professional, and yet still conveys the idea

that this person could be seen sitting on a couch for 14 hours at a time.

It says, “I’m one of you…

but I’m also way richer than you.”

But the BONUS POINTS go to the one true business gamer fashion:

ill-fitting blazer,

diesel jeans,

gamer t-shirt.

The third key is set dressing.

This has to be theatrical, which is to say, inappropriate for a trade show.

Take a look at Sony’s weird barn church.

It was like an immersive theatrical experience, but with the 10-minute scene transitions of

a high school production of Les Mis.

But the BONUS POINTS go to live, human set pieces, like, I don't know, hanging bodies

from the ceiling that FLAIL AROUND when a character moves through them on the screen.

There’s that classic Sony magic!

I want to remind people that E3 is a trade show.

And this is kind of like if Disney held a press conference about the Avengers and then

DISINTEGRATED A MAN LIVE ON STAGE.

Now we’re moving into the meat and potatoes of the presentation with key number four:

Numbers.

Video Games are just programs and programs are just numbers and for some reason, gamers

love it when numbers are big.

A few good numbers to say are polygon count, amount of enemies on screen, RAM?

Maybe?

I don't know, who gives a shit!?

Honestly, BONUS POINTS go to saying a number that's completely devoid of context.

Because numbers mean…

INNOVATION.

Key number 5.

More specifically... less specifically.

I need this to be the vaguest discussion ever.

I need you to make claims about how you’re doing something that’s never been done before

and then not tell us what you're doing.

Here’s a list of innovative words and phrases.

It’s the presenter’s job to say each and every one of these.

But the BONUS POINTS go to the purest form of expressing innovation.

Looking up at the screen behind you, looking back at the audience, and saying…

“Wow.”

Key number six is the game trailer montage.

You’ve probably never heard of these games before.

You might never hear of them again, but the BONUS POINTS go to the game trailer montage

that comes at the end of the presentation, which is just showing you everything you've

seen so far set to an Arcade Fire soundalike.

These six keys are the foundation of a solid E3 presentation.

You hit these six, you’re in the clear.

But you haven’t achieved perfection yet.

But before we get into the final four, let’s talk about the notable absences.

These are anti-keys, things you’ll never see in an E3 presentation.

I got a list of them here…

Oh what’s this, it’s just a single entry that says “A legitimate discussion about

how to address the crunch crisis that's prevalent in nearly every game studio.”

Well I guess we don't need these anymore!

*wild laughter*

*frightening laughter*

*pained laughter*

*pain*

And now, it's time for the final four keys.

These are the Truly Special Moments.

They’re hard to build in, but they turn a good presentation into a transcendent one.

Key number seven: A “WHYW” game.

This is an acronym that stands for “What? Hell yeah! What!?”

and it's used for a game that makes you go,

“What?

Hell Yeah!

WHAT!?”

Often these are for games that are totally independent, but the best ones are for weird

entries into beloved franchise, like the Final Fantasy XV VR Fishing Game.

Even now, when someone tells me there’s a Final Fantasy XV VR Fishing Game, I go What? HELL YEAH! WHAT!?

But the BONUS POINTS... you know what, actually, no.

You only get bonus points if you make a VR fishing game for a beloved franchise.

I want to watch the Doomslayer catch a bass.

But sometimes, the presenter has a WHYW moment.

That’s why key eight is heartfelt emotion.

Genuine excitement about a game, joy, sadness.

This has to happen naturally.

Honestly, if I’m having a rough day, I will go back and watch the video of Ubisoft developer

Davide Soliani crying after Shigeru Miyamoto compliments him onstage, because that is the

realest and most joyful moment.

Honestly, who wouldn’t burst out crying if Shigeru Miyamoto, the architect of many

of our childhoods, complimented them?

You know, that, that tiny thing... that reminder that these people behind the games are human

beings and can be emotionally moved by the same experience that they get to share with you.

What could be better than that?

If they farted.

That's why key number nine is gaffes!

Gaffes are INTEGRAL to E3, so much so that they're split into three different categories.

The first is technical.

Gameplay going awry.

Cameras cutting back too early.

Mics not getting shut off.

The second category is human.

Awkward pauses, stiff actors, weird phrasing.

These stick in your brain forever.

Honestly, it feels like they’re planned in order to be meme-able and rememberoareble.

Mem- and memorable.

Memorable.

God, I can’t speak today…

OR CAN I?

THE THIRD CATEGORY IS PLANNED GAFFES.

I’m about to blow this whole thing wide open.

Everyone can quote at least one E3 gaffe.

Even people who don’t know who Reggie Fils Aime is have probably said “my body is ready”

at least once in their life.

And you want to know what that is?

GUERRILLA MARKETING.

The only reason there are so many gaffes in E3 presentations is to MAKE YOU SHARE THE GAFFES.

YOU MIGHT NOT REMEMBER THE GOOD PRESENTATIONS, BUT YOU SURE AS HELL LAUGHED AT THE MESSY ONES.

THE GAFFES ARE AN INSIDE JOB TO MAKE YOU BUY MORE VIDEO GAMES.

So honestly, I’m just gonna assume that all of these are planned from here on out

in order to make you talk about them online.

Except for when Todd Howard says something that's weirdly horny.

Todd: "You'll never know when you'll need a free hand."

That’s just Todd.

BONUS POINTS for horny Todd.

And the final key: The Big Finish.

This is a game announcement that falls purely into the fanservice bucket.

It is unimaginably amazing, incomprehensibly great, unbelievably too good to be true and

honestly, it's because it probably is too good to be true.

The presenter is gonna say “And one more thing,” and then they're gonna show a trailer

that’s probably a landscape shot, maybe some voiceover, and then just a title screen.

BONUS POINTS if it literally is just a title screen.

And then that game is probably gonna get stuck in development hell for 7 years and maybe

not get released ever.

But isn’t that what we want, as gamers?

To be disappointed?

And those are the 10 keys to a perfect E3 presentation.

Follow these and you can do no wrong.

And if you aren’t doing an E3 presentation, again, you could potentially use them as a

drinking game.

It's not like I wrote up all the rules already and you can click and you can play 'em along

with us since we're gonna watch all the E3 presentations.

And to prove the power of these keys, here’s my perfect E3 presentation.

Sony, go ahead and just plug your trailers into the placeholders I set up for you.

What does a gamer want?

(what does a gamer want, tell me what does a gamer want)

What does a gamer need?

(what does a gamer need, tell me what does a gamer need)

The games we make are powerful,

never been done before.

So let your inner gamer out, we’ll open up the door!

I know you’ll love these games, because I love these games, too.

And it feels the best when there’s an excited gamer inside you.

Hunter, Hunter, let me get off of the skate...

Jesus.

Hunter, get it!

Good afternoon, and welcome to Unraveled Games’ E3 press conference.

As a gamer myself, you can tell by the shirt, I’m so excited to share these fresh gaming

innovations with you all today.

But before we get to the fun part, let's talk some business.

Let me put on my blazer.

Let’s talk about how we’re changing the game… of games.

The new Unraveled Engine has allowed us to create experiences that are more detailed

than ever before.

I'm talking about 1,200 enemies onscreen concurrently, over 49 meganpixels of screen dissolution,

62 giganbotes of RAM,

and SEVEN HUNDRED and TWENTY THOUSAND…

I know it sounds like science fiction, but it’s science fact.

Why don’t we highlight a few of the games that are coming out on the Unraveled Engine.

We can go to the next slide.

Jen?

Jen, we can go to the next.

Next Gen!

First up, Unraveled Research 2.

Fans loved the experience of creating spreadsheets about video game lore, but in this immersive

sequel, you can do that with a mustache.

Wow.

And that’s not all.

We have Explaining Your Job to your Relatives Simulator, the Dark Souls of simulation games.

Experience the terror firsthand of trying to explain to your uncle that you work in

a very niche, unstable industry, but with graphics so lifelike you’ll feel like you’re

living in the world of the game.

No, Uncle Bob, I don’t make the video games, I just make videos about them.

No, they aren’t the trailers.

Terrifying.

And finally, something groundbreaking, something that seems impossible, but we did it.

I hope you come along with us on this journey of...

BDG Goes Fishing for the First Time

in VR.

*What?

Hell yeah!

What!?*

*Audience cheering*

I've got the rest of the press conference to get through, you

can quiet down, please.

But is that all we’ve got for you?

Not in the slightest.

Now it's time to show you some stuff from the company that didn't do the presentation,

and let us do all the hard work for them.

Hit it.

*Arcade Fire soundalike plays*

Wow.

You know, I, um, I'm gonna go off script a little bit.

I, uh, it just, I've...

It means so much to me to be up here on this stage in front of you.

It's been a dream since I was a kid to be presenting something at E3, and to have you

here in the audience... to, to feel the support that you've given Unraveled Games, is...

Honestly, it's, um...

I never in a million years thought that I could have-

OH JESUS, HUNTER, DON'T TRY TO...

God damnit.

Okay that’s it, uh, thank you all for coming.

Except we've got one more thing thing for you.

We’ve been working on something very special with some very special people.

From the visionary minds of David Cage and Peter Molyneux, we have teamed up with publisher

Konami to release an exclusive on Soulja Boy’s gaming console… you know what, I won’t

bore you with the business details, I’ll just let you see the trailer.

Voice over: Yeah.

I think it’s time.

*intense music plays*

*applause*

Thank you all so much for coming!

Thank you.

Have a great E3!

Hunter, get it!

*CRASH* Ha, we're good.

That's the take though.

*everyone laughing* Almost, almost broke a laptop.

But that's fine.

We're good.

Clayton (offscreen): Set a couple fires, it's okay!

Brian: We, we, this is the most intense...

Pat: We're not allowed to do this show anymore. 
 2020-06-25 16:20:08,558 - DEBUG - file running:  *hydraulic machine noises*

Fallout.

This scrappy, billion-dollar franchise takes a fun, kooky

look at planet-wide armageddon.

It's an alternate history, splitting off from our timeline somewhere

around World War II.

Despite the divergence, Fallout features some familiar real world

culture and plenty of cultural innovation. There are new architectural styles that are

stolen from Mad Max. And plenty of cool new fashion

that is also just ripped off from Mad Max.

And yet, even with this cultural innovation, Fallout has one massive problem.

And there's only one problem with the Fallout series right now.

Other than that, the Fallout series is doing just fine.

D-despite this one. It's just the one of them.

Why, Todd,

is the music still this?

*audio from three Fallout songs played simultaneously*

The same dozen songs from before the apocalypse.

You're telling me that humans figured out how to

make a gun that turns you into goo, and yet they haven't made any new music?

That’s garbage, Todd.

Fallout is a meditation on mutation and the ways that humanity and culture

evolve to meet new challenges,

and having music that stays the same the whole time is a plot hole.

War never changes. But music should.

And today, I’m going to change it.

*tech montage music playing*

Ooh! This is a new dance move for me.

I don't know if I like it yet.

Now, you may think that Fallout’s music is fine. It fits the aesthetic, and

it adds a sense of retrofuturism.

But you’re wrong, and here’s why.

The Fallout games range in time from 2102, the year of Fallout 76, to 2287, the year of Fallout 4.

That’s a span of 185 years. Imagine for a second that our musical sensibilities hadn’t been

updated in nearly two hundred years, and the current song topping the Billboard charts

was The Alphabet Song, a song literally written about 185 years ago.

Actually, that kind of sounds possible. Modern times are weird.

What I’m saying is that if 80% of humans died today, in 100 years,

we'd still have Old Town Road, but it would have a few more remixes.

Do you really think that if the world ended in 1997, our culture would linger over

"Barbie Girl" and "Tubthumping"? That we would be complacent with the cultural detritus of euro-techno,

manufactured pop, and third-wave ska?

NO!

And yet it seems the people of Fallout have

forgotten how to make music.

Fallout 76 is littered with instruments and bandstands and stages,

but by the time you get to Fallout 3, the only instrument left is a Stradivarius

violin locked in a vault surrounded by mirelurks.

Fallout 76 also has the highest track count,

nearly twice as many as all of the other games, which implies that these tracks are being

lost over time, and nothing is there to replace it.

Only two people in the entire 185-year-span

of these games are making new songs. The first is a synth that makes the same bluesy style

as the rest of the music.

It’s good but it’s not different.

The other is a burnout DJ who does not seem to know how to sing or play an instrument.

And yet he still insists on playing a guitar,

which goes to prove that even in the apocalypse, you can’t escape

the guy who will bring his guitar to your party.

Thank god the bombs went off before "Wonderwall."

People need food to eat, sure, and, you know, clothes to cover their sinful

bods so that makes sense that those areas have continued to flourish. But Fallout is

a world where people have ignored the basic human endeavor of making art.

I won’t stand for that!

We need art because of its fundamental importance to human expression.

Songs were made long before written language to help keep stories alive, and they'd be added to

and embellished, much like the cultural touchstone of our time,

TVTropes.org.

Science may improve our health and longevity, but art is what makes long life worth living.

And that’s why I am here — to scientifically improve on this art,

and synthesize a totally new genre of music that we should be hearing in the Fallout universe.

This genre should be inspired by the music landscape and culture of Fallout's world.

Any cultural step that goes One Step Beyond current accepted standards

risks alienating its audience by being too challenging,

too intelligent.

So let’s guide our creation by considering the 10 definitive purposes of music

and how they fit into the beautiful wasteland of Todd’s mindscape.

First, to create or control emotion.

From the soaring, triumphant music of Jurassic Park

to the ice cream truck version of "Pop Goes the Weasel,"

which, for reasons I don’t understand, always makes me cry.

Evoking emotion is the number one use for music.

So what does that mean for Fallout? Well, one thing the soundtrack does get right is the upbeat tempo

of most of the songs. It cheers up the experience of playing through the wasteland.

Except for the miserable, inescapable energy of "Johnny Guitar."

Play it again, my Johnny.

In the wasteland, you need something to rev you up, keep you moving. And that's why this new genre

will only feature peppy songs.

Two: remembering or sharing information.

These can be simple mnemonics like Schoolhouse Rock! Or classic story ballads

like Kesha’s "TiK ToK."

I actually believe these will be more important than emotions just because

written language seems to be pretty dead in the future. It’s all on abandoned computers

or in diaries safely tucked up in a skeleton's ribcage.

Up-to-date information is transmitted verbally, and think about how much further it could go if it was sung.

Even an S.O.S. signal gets more traction if it comes with a little ditty,

and I learned that from Rihanna.

Three: Entertainment.

*cheesy music plays*

Four: Jingles. In other words,

propaganda.

Commercial jingles are designed to make you remember brands, and political songs fit here, too.

Because what is the "Star Spangled Banner" if not America’s jingle?

Despite the amount of remnant advertising for companies like Nuka-Cola and Radiation King,

the only jingles that remain in Fallout are the ones on Gene Autry’s spurs.

*(I Got Spurs That) Jingle, Jangle, Jingle plays ominously*

In the song he says his spurs jingl-

Fallout does have a few antiquated political songs on Enclave Radio, but as Plato said:

“Any musical innovation is full of danger to the whole State...

when modes of music change, the State always changes with them.”

Thank you, Plato.

The transitive property means that the opposite must be true as well.

Fallout’s state has very much changed, and so too should the music.

So our music genre should be catchy to the point of propaganda.

You hear this song once, and you know the hook and exactly what it wants you to do.

Five: To mark time rhythmically in a group, like a chain gang or rowing.

An underlying theme of Fallout is a disruption of low-wage labor systems.

Half the locations are robot warehouses or Nuka-Cola factories

or the industrial goo pit where The Joker was made.

In the 2100s, commerce is no longer the main structure around

which a human’s life is organized.

So fuck the Man, and fuck the beat he made you drum to.

The Man was beating you down, so we’re gonna focus on the up-beats.

The off-beats. Something more syncopated.

This isn't to say we're going to get overly complicated with 7/4s and 15/8 time signatures.

Those time signatures only belong in math rock,

which is to say in the garbage.

We’re taking back 4/4 from the Man and we're making it our own.

Six: Tradition music, to mark events or occasions.

This can range from singing "Auld Lang Syne" on New Years

to playing "Pop Goes the Weasel" whenever one of your pet weasels died when you were a kid.

THAT'S WHY.

They’re just songs that usher in a specific moment, like an alarm.

But most cultures in Fallout don’t seem to use them.

At the end of the quest “A Nice Day for a Right Wedding,” there is a wedding but no wedding march.

And in the quest “For Auld Lang Syne,” they do not play "Auld Lang Syne."

Which means there’s a real opening to be the only tradition song for every holiday in Fallout.

It may seem lame to force a tradition song, like making all of your friends call you by a nickname you gave yourself,

but if you believe that every tradition song came about naturally, you’re naive.

You think Vitamin C didn’t know that the graduation song would become a once-a-year cash cow?

That when Green Day was writing “Good Riddance” they weren’t

thinking “Some sitcoms are gonna have to end someday.”

Tradition songs can be crafted,

and our first song in this new genre will fit this bill.

Seven: Ambient music or background music.

A.K.A. Chill anime beats to study and relax to.

Nobody in Fallout is studying or relaxing. This one is a guide on what not to do in our new genre.

Our genre should be present and aggressive, and when you’re listening to it, you are listening to it.

Eight: To create or maintain social groups.

Without labor to constrict a person’s time or movement,

people organize into social, cult-like gangs, which makes this category

a big one. You’ve got LARPers, the AV club, the rude boys, all of which have their own

cultural standards. But there is a distinct lack of punks, which came about through a

shared political consciousness expressed through music. But we can be that, we just need to

include identity-establishing lyrics that appeal to all denizens of the Wasteland.

Perhaps this genre will help unify all of the many warring factions.

Or at least create a new, very cool warring faction.

Number nine: Stimulating physical movement. Dancing.

There is no dancing in Fallout! Well, there are a few sex workers in Fallout New Vegas that dance, but it kind

of just looks like the dancing baby gif, so I don’t think that should count.

And Fallout 76 hasn’t included a singular dancing emote. All they have are things like “smoking kills”

and “join my polycule?”

This is probably to avoid overlapping with Fortnite, which

does have a pretty long head start on dancing emotes. So for the sake of originality, I

had my research assistant, Google, find all of the dances that haven't been included in Fortnite yet.

It's just a Regency-era quadrille, and skanking.

We will make it work.

And the tenth purpose of music is to use it as a crutch when you can’t think of a different way

to end a video.

Actually, I don't think this one really applies to the Fallout universe,

so I'm just gonna take it off.

So with our nine definitive purposes of music, we can

begin to build our genre. And the more I’m thinking about these nine purposes, the more

I'm realizing that Fallout has the opportunity to create the perfect genre. One not tied

down to the whims of society.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

The current music in Fallout is overwhelmingly jazz standards and rhythm and blues,

so we'll incorporate elements from those genres.

We’ll have heavy beats, syncopation, rhythm guitar, and honestly, any instrument

that fits in a mobile wasteland setting. So no pianos, but any marching instrument, like

trumpets and trombones. Things that stand up to roughing it and also would appeal to

the Brotherhood of Steel. Another thing these jazz standards excel at is having a powerful,

catchy melody sung by a main vocalist, but since it’s hard to maintain your safety

as a loner in the wasteland, we can have a lot of backing vocalists, too.

If you can carry a gun, you can carry a tune.

In terms of topics for the songs, we'll keep the themes

relevant to the people of Fallout, which based on my experience seems to be freedom from

tyranny, looting, and drinking so I can be stronger and carry more loot.

Now, we mix together these in-fiction elements with our nine definitive purposes of music.

One: We’re gonna make people happy. Needs to be Jeep commercial music. Yeah, your wife just got

eaten by a yao guai, but listen to that skiffle.

Two: All of our heroes are dead. So it's time

to make new heroes. How else are we gonna know how many beers Janice drank last week,

or how far Kevin’s head went flying when a super mutant tagged him with a fire hydrant.

Three:

Bangers only.

Four: What should I do with the information about how many beers

Janice drank? Tell me.

This is music for the scavenger, not the assembly line worker. There’s

a whole world of useful scrap out there, and this music should inspire you to get out there

and pick it up!

Six: The old ways are dead! And we've gotta make new songs to celebrate

the new ways. There is no song for when your Swamp Itch clears up.

But there should be.

Seven: Background music? NO. This is FOREGROUND MUSIC.

Eight: Fallout is a world divided,

awaiting a messiah of music to bring them all together

or at least inspire them to wear cooler clothes.

Nine: The music should inspire dances that are violent and rushed, just like

the world you're in. Yeah, your fists are used for melee, but that leaves your feet

and your elbows open to fuckin' jam!

You starting to imagine it? You starting to hear those first few notes in your head? THAT’S GOOD!

What are we gonna call this new genre that

is peppy! Informational! Good! Catchy! Pick up loot!

Traditional! In your face! Punk!

Kicks! Energetic! Educational! Fun! Sticks in your head! Pick it up!

For your cousin Ben's wedding! Right there! Society.

*dancing noises*

Spicy! Slaps hard! Pick it up! Propaganda.

Arbor Day! Pick it up!

Fuck you, Philip Glass!

Pick it up! Let's all wear the same shoes!

*repeating "DANCE!" and "PICK IT UP" over and over*

Pick it up!

*heavy breathing*

Did I just make Ska again?

*Ska music starts*

You spend your life living in a vault, and your mind begins to crack.

And when you get outside, there’s nothing to welcome you back.

She found me passed out in a rundown shack with Nuka Buzz in my hand.

She picked me up and she slapped my face, and said "Come on let’s start a band!"

She said: START THE MUSIC, Pick up loot, get off your ass!

If you don’t feel the Brotherhood of Steel, join the Brotherhood of Brass.

She said: START THE NEW, War never changes, that’s a bore!

You know we’ll eclipse the apocalypse

with a loud and brassy SKALLOUT WAR.

SKALLOUT WAR!

SKALLOUT WAR!

SKALLOUT WAAAAAAAAR!

SKALLOUT WAR!

I've never skanked so hard in my life. 
 2020-06-25 16:20:08,559 - DEBUG - file running:  Fire Emblem!

This magnificent franchise pushes the boundaries of gaming by daring to ask the question,

"What if chess made you horny?"

Fire Emblem is turning 30 next year, and with 16 main games and few spinoffs,

it's safe to say that it has grown into something extraordinary.

The games are packed with deep storylines and memorable characters, like Marth.

That's not Marth? Marth.

That's- which one is Marth?

Marth.

The problem with having such a prolific series is that the characters start to blend together.

One needs only to look at the Super Smash Bros. roster to see that

Fire Emblem characters are a bit hard to differentiate.

It's like trying to remember your coworkers' names after meeting them once at a work mixer.

Except in this case, your coworkers all have swords and can only make one facial expression.

But do not worry. There is an answer to this conundrum. Because today,

I'm going to teach you how to tell apart every Fire Emblem character.

*cheery synth music*

My face is just not built for this expression.

First step in this process is to collect a list of the characters.

Turns out, even after trimming the nonplayable ones and the ones from the Tokyo Mirage Sessions,

there are nearly 600 Fire Emblem characters.

I cannot explain that many characters.

I have made that mistake before.

"Trying to categorize all 600 Castlevania monsters was a bad idea."

But the beauty of making mistakes is that you can learn from them. And I now know understand

that explaining 600 discrete characters wouldn't actually be helpful.

Human beings aren't meant to remember 600 people perfectly. If you don't believe me,

just try to remember something about every single person in your contact list.

I have a contact for someone name Zain.

And in the company, it just says "Bocce Ball."

Who the fuck is this?

But unlike my contact list, Fire Emblem's have plotlines.

And in my experience playing these games, I noticed

that a lot of these different characters fit similar roles in their respective games.

And I'm not the only one who's noticed this. On the Fire Emblem wiki, there is a whole list

of archetypes based on different characters.

A list that I only found after spending whole day trying to categorize them on my own.

And it's just so fun to realize that you've wasted a whole day of work.

But this list intrigued me.

Stock characters in similar circumstances playing again and again in different stories.

Does that remind you of anything?

Of course it does!

It reminds you of the commedia dell'arte,

because it reminds me of the commedia dell'arte.

And it's so obviously the commedia dell'arte that I don't need to explain it.

But I will for the sake of extending this video.

The commedia dell'arte was an Italian form of theater that was big in the 16th to 18th centuries,

and it relied on stock characters wearing masks or costumes to designate who they were.

That way the audience could be like,

"Ah, that dude's wearing a tight fitting suit with a bunch of weird patches, that must

be Arlecchino, the servant clown — sometimes to two masters!"

This brought the audience in immediately. They knew what that character was about without any exposition.

In the same way, Fire Emblem has dozens of recurring characters that get you through each game.

And this is how we're going to tell them apart. By defining their archetypes.

Fire Emblem goes one step further.

Because these characters can not only serve the same story purpose,

but they can have a similar role in the gameplay.

And this goes to prove my theory

that Fire Emblem is not only the spiritual successor to commedia dell'arte,

it is its natural evolution.

An elevated form I call...

THE COMMEDIA DELL'ANIME.

The newer, more perfect form of theater.

We just have to boil down the Fire Emblem personnel into

*kiss*

syrupy stock characters.

Let's begin with the archetypes that are standard.

Cain and Abel are battle bros. They fight together, but not in the biblical sense.

Bord and Cords are similar except they're usually axe fighters.

Pegasus sisters are a trio of flying horses ladies.

You can't split these archetypes up into their solo characters because their bond is what defines them.

You can't have a Waluigi without a Luigi.

And in the same way, you can't have a Bord without a Cord.

Which is my favorite Dr. Seuss book.

Jagens are mentors that are strong in the beginning and then you'll quickly outpace them, and it's kind of sad.

Like the first time you beat your dad in a basketball game.

Oifeys are similar to Jagens,

except they'll keep dunking on you till you're dead.

Wendells but for magic.

Gotohs are mentors but only the last half of the game.

Beowolfs are mercenaries that you have to pay actual in-game currency

to recruit, and Ogmas are mercenaries that usually decide to join you out of their own volition.

Which is, by definition, not a mercenary.

Navarres are silent, moody sword swingers.

Kind of like if that person who said they studied the blade actually studied the blade.

There are also a bunch of villains but for different reasons. Power. Ambition. Loyalty.

Wyvern riding, I guess.

And getting possessed, which is a classic mistake.

Some archetypes are based on their gameplay requirements.

Very difficult to recruit.

Usually recruited after they've been kidnapped.

Late game recruits that could be good, but you have to work hard.

Super low level villagers that could also be good.

And if you recruit one of these pairs,

you can't get the other.

Kind of like if two of your friends start dating and then have a really messy breakup.

Corneliuses are usually the parental figure to the main character,

and they have this nasty habit of getting axed super early on in the game.

It's kind of like Fire Emblem doesn't know how to make interesting characters without making them

suffer traumatic parental death.

Tacticians. Young female mages. Young female healers.

Young male mages.

Thieves.

Jeorges do that thing where they pretend to be not important

and then SURPRISE, I wasn't an old crone, I was a magical witch the whole time!

Except they're not very good at hiding the fact that they're important.

And the creepy version of the Jeorges:

The Tikis.

Usually they take the form of a small girl or adolescent, except

they're really 400 years old and a god or a dragon.

And I honestly do not have the time to unpack this bullshit.

These 29 archetypes are useful, but they only cover 229 characters.

There are still 367 to go. If we keep this up, we're going to end up with 75 archetypes.

The commedia dell'arte only has about 17.

So before we move on, let's combine some.

These six are all mentors to varying degrees of usefulness.

These are all defined by their villainy and only some of them become playable.

Welcome to Cain Siblings Incorporated, where we all have a sibling like bond and do the same job.

These all have very specific requirements for recruiting.

These both do that thing where they don't seem important and then Surprise!

I'm important!

These are all hard to make good but they're worth it if you put the effort in.

These are all precocious little magic babies.

And that leaves the Navarres unconnected,

but that's because I'm changing the archetype to Spicy Swords. Because we can include so

many other characters if we just expand the definitions to any swordweilder

who's a little spicy.

In fact, by combining these other archetypes, there are now tons of other characters who

fit into these expanded definitions.

We are left with 288 characters to categorize. But before I get there,

I just want to commend Fire Emblem for have 596 playable characters

and only repeating three names.

When I was hired for my first job at a climbing gym,

I was one of five employees named Brian, and it was a small gym.

But I guess it's pretty easy to cut out repetitions when you use dope-ass names like Skrimir.

Dagdar.

Sleuf.

Fjorm.

Belf.

I could go on all day.

But I won't. Because it's time to get the rest of the archetypes on the wall.

*charging noise*

That took like 30 minutes. But let's begin.

The honorable knight, like Fiona, who cares passionately about her people,

and will always oppose cruelty to civilians.

Which is way better than the loyal knight, like Troude, who only is loyal

to Perne, and will do literally anything for him even though Perne is a bad dude.

But I'll get to that later.

These four archetypes are calm and aloof, and the only thing that differentiates them

is how much you would want to invite them to your birthday party.

I'm just gonna get the blank slate archetype out of the way now,

because Fire Emblem is a game with permadeath,

and so sometimes you just need more meat for the grinder, you know?

Similar to the blank slate is the protagonist,

which is always relatively heroic, but since they're a conduit for the player, they're all pretty vague.

I realize that by smooshing them all together into one category,

I've made the majority of the Fire Emblem roster in Super Smash indistinguishable.

But that's not my fault!

Super Smash should've included more magic babies!

Arrogants, hotheads, and edgelords all have a mean side,

but arrogants like Vaike just think they're the best.

Hotheads like Caspar want to fight anything that moves.

And edgelords like Niles retweet Joker accounts unironically.

A lot of these characters have rough childhoods but then turn out cheerful despite that.

And then there's the inferiority complex archetype, which I could have just called

"The majority of children in Fire Emblem: Fates."

Perfectionists, mischief makers, and flirts are all highly motivated.

But Subaki is motivated to meet high expectations.

Claude is motivated to make intricate schemes.

And Sylvain is motivated to be a fuccboi.

Buzzkills are just characters that aren't very fun to talk to.

And Fire Emblem, I will never forgive you for naming an unemotional, uber religious, deadbeat dad Gilbert.

It also doesn't help that I look like Hanneman Lite.

Oh god, am I a buzzkill?

A lot of these archetypes are based around one singular personality trait.

Scarlet's straightforward. Valbar's chill.

Linhardt's lazy. Sumia's clumsy. Petra's a sweetie.

And Ranulf is a furry.

Dramatic, painter, and fashionable are defined by their love of the arts

and how much it sucks that they gotta be a soldier instead.

Some archetypes upset the status quo by defying gender norms

or by calling out the noble class, and that's why they're comrades.

Child soldier.

Karin is canonically 14 years old.

Whoopsie!

But even if they aren't a child, they could still be naive.

Which brings around the overprotective archetype,

which is just essentially helicopter parents.

Manuela is constantly drinking and flirting and just being a hot mess and I love her for it.

And that makes her the president of vices.

The vice president.

But be careful not to do that around someone like Astram, who is constantly accusing people of treason

for no good reason.

There's a lot of characters in the meek murderer archetype

because Fire Emblem loves to make characters that are quiet and shy and really self conscious,

and then can WRECK SHOP on the battlefield.

Here's an archetype I call "what the fuck" and it's the three characters that make me say,

"What the fuck, Fire Emblem?"

People like Perne, who is said to be a sweet Robin Hood type,

except he does kidnap a young girl and keeps her as his slave.

Or Tharja, who practices curses on her own daughter.

Or Roger, who is act- he's not actually that bad.

But Fire Emblem does go out of their way to make his endscreen say that he never gets a date

and he stays single for the rest of his life.

And it's like, what the fuck, Fire Emblem? You didn't have to do him dirty like that.

The next archetype is called "actually pretty interesting." These characters are three dimensional

and well-developed. People like Libra, who struggles with his faith and has incredible

self doubt even though he's doing all he can to help those around him. Or Rhys, who dreams

of being a swordfighter, but his weak constitution won't allow him to become one. And so he helps

in the ways he can, but his whole story is one of unfulfilled dreams.

And that's it.

Those are the only two interesting characters in Fire Emblem.

Until we get to Raphael.

My sweet, bulky boy who only cares about eating and training and not about studying.

The thing is, the Fire Emblem world has moved past himbos and bimbos.

Welcome to the age of thembos.

There. 45 archetypes to help you differentiate the 596 Fire Emblem characters.

If you're a GOSH DANG ROCKET SCIENTIST!

45 is still too much! We can combine these.

We'll take these six and combine them to create a new archetype that is as important as it is bland.

These three can be more succinctly summarized in a category called

"Holy shit, why are you a soldier?"

Let's just go ahead and cordon off all of the assholes.

And now we can take these straight-talking suck ups and call them teacher's pets.

Shhhh.

These three archetypes all have tough exteriors to break through.

These three archetypes really explore familial bonds,

which is a RARE CONDITION, IN THIS DAY-

Whether it's a good or bad reaction doesn't matter to this group, they just want to be seen.

They're just too nice for all this!

These four archetypes will always be subverting expectations.

It's fairly surprising that these three archetypes were let in.

Chill dudes? Gambling? A bunch of hunks?

Damn if these aren't fun to hang out with.

All three of these are going to time out, 'cause they need to calm it down.

And there we go.

The 13 archetypes that make it possible to differentiate the Fire Emblem characters.

Just 13 of them.

That's fewer than the commedia dell'arte.

It's only 13.

Which is not only an unlucky number,

but it is TOO LARGE for your TINY CHILD BRAINS.

We can make it better! We can combine more! WE CAN PERFECT THIS!

Granted, it's a little bit harder to combine these archetypes, but just off the bat, we can take

"look at me baby" and "making waves" and just combine it into one thing, trendsetters.

And the "necessary but boring" and the "asshole crew" and the "teacher's pets" and the "calm it downs,"

they all fill me with a sense of UGH.

And obviously the "too nice for this" and the "lied on your resume" and the "holy shit why are you a soldiers"

are all just a bad choice for a war!

And that just leaves us with the characters that are hard to break

the ice with, and uh, the ones that got family issues, and the quiet ones, and the ones that

are fun to hang out with!

Uh.

And that just sounds like a pretty run-of-the-mill

awkward family reunion.

And when you think about it, these ones are just strange characters that

have, uh, that are good at fighting.

I mean if you include Dmitri in this, he has an eye patch!

Okay, which is similar to these ones.

Seteth and Byleth have the, they rhyme.

Uh we also, I mean.

Dorothea wears a hat until she grows out of the hat.

Think about that!

Don't even get me started on Oboro.

I don't know who that is.

Is it pronounced "dice" or "deesay?"

And we can have a category called

"anime character with a singular personality trait and a penchant for violence"

and that's just the one category!

Which PROVES that the Fire Emblem characters are all essentially the same,

and that you cannot differentiate them.

Mission complete!

What was this Unraveled about again?

...Sometimes to two masters!

Patrick: Now Italian.

(Brian in a shitty Italian accent) Ah! That guy is...

oh god I don't know if I can.

Ah that dudes wearing a tight fitting suit with a buncha weird patches it

must be Arlecchino the servant clown sometimesa to two masters!

(Pat and Jenna offscreen laughing)

Brian: Ah I don't know if... Okay.

Pat: We don't have to use it but we need to record it. 
 2020-06-25 16:20:08,559 - DEBUG - file running:  Should auld acquaintance be forgot.

And

all

that

JAZZ.

THAT’S RIGHT FRIENDS it’s Game of the Year season!

Which means it's time for us to hop on those message boards, chat about our favorite games,

and tear out each other’s throats when someone expresses an opinion

that is slightly different from our own.

By this point, pretty much every gaming publication has announced their Game of the Year...

uhh...

which means that I'm a bit late.

Anything that I say is just a drop in the ocean of discourse.

No one wants to hear my opinion.

WHICH IS WHY I AM NOT EXPRESSING AN OPINION.

I AM STATING A FACT.

That’s right, I have devised a statistical, analytical, number-crunching formula

that will SCIENTIFICALLY PROVE

THE GAME OF THE YEAR.

*hype 80s music plays*

They said it couldn’t be done.

A bias-free formula to calculate the game of the year?

That's a fool’s errand, Brian!

You are a fool!

They called me a fool!

But do I look like a fool to you?

I’ve done it, and with the knowledge I have found, I can go ahead and assuage any arguments

you might have with your friends.

There is nothing to debate anymore, there is only the truth, that the best game of the year is...

hidden somewhere, um, in these spreadsheets.

I'm gonna be honest with you, I haven’t...

there are a lot of numbers.

And I haven't had the time to, uh, do them all just yet.

But it’s only December 14th.

This video is set to go up on the 30th, which means I still have two weeks for new games

to come in before I can really call which game is the game of the year.

But I've at least finished the formula, and I’ve tested it on a few to make sure it

runs correctly.

And everyone knows that you can’t get full credit unless you show your work.

So let me show you how I made it.

First thing you gotta do when you're making a GOTY formula is find your list of games.

And obviously we're going to have to choose every single game that was released this year

in order for us to say that it is scientifically accurate.

So if we just go ahead and take a look at Steam and see how many were released since

January 1st 20-hmm.

That's over 15,000.

You can't make me do that, legally.

That's not in my contract.

Right?

I can't... they can't legally make me do that.

Look, as much as video game reviews can be an imperfect reflection of the person who

is writing them, they are still a pretty solid baseline for which video games mattered in our culture.

Even if a review is bad, it still means it was good enough for someone to spend time on it.

So I went Metacritic and I took all the games that were rated 80 or above, and at

the time of writing this script, that was 181 games.

So I'm gonna do the formula for all of those.

Some of these games were DLCs or re-releases onto new platforms.

The Switch alone resurrected about a dozen candidates from years past.

But since they were released this year, they are still technically in the running.

Fight me.

Now that we have the list, it's time to make the formula, and it might surprise you to

hear this, but I have not been in a pure mathematics class in about five years.

So I reached out to some scientists.

And then none of them got back to me.

So I called my old roommate.

“Hey, I’m Nicholas.

I’m a graduate student studying exoplanet atmospheres.”

Nick is working toward a PhD at MIT, and though I was a bit worried about reaching out to

him since his specialization is in astrophysics and not stats about video games,

he assuaged all my fears.

Brian - "Would you say you are a math expert?”

Nick - “No.”

We chatted for about a half an hour, diving deep into the scientific method and the selfless

goals of discovery.

Brian - “If I invent a unit... can I trademark it.”

Nick - “I think your final score should be, like, in Gilberts or whatever.”

Brian - "OK!"

And we finished our chat with the reassurance that this formula was not only going to help

the gaming community, but the scientific community at large.

Brian - “Do you think if I wrote this up, I could get it published in, like, Nature?"

Nick - “No.”

So where to do we go from here now that we have been scientifically rejuvenated?

It's time to build the criteria.

What specifically makes a game of the year?

Number one, what is the game worth?

We're not just talking about monetary worth, we're also talking about the amount of enjoyment

you get while playing the game.

Number two, how them graphics?

We’re trying to find specific numbers associated with these games, and graphics is just a bunch

of numbers anyway, so this will be a useful part.

Number three, how did it affect the cultural miasma?

Look, it’s all about those google results, how many people are talking about the game?

And most importantly, is the game art?

I've figured it out.

Which means that no one has to write any more goddamn thinkpieces about this topic ever again!

Given these four criteria, I sat down with Tara Long, former bioinformatics researcher

and also my current boss.

She and I figured out a formula that will end up with a numerical value that will tell

us the game of the year.

The higher the number, the better the game.

We’ll start with game worth.

Now it’s hard for us to find how worth it a game is to play from a numerical standpoint,

but if you take Metacritic’s score as a percentage of the game you enjoy, and you

multiply that by the average amount of minutes each playthrough takes using the stats from

howlongtobeat.com, then you end up with a number of minutes you have spent enjoying said game.

Now, to tie in material worth, we want to go ahead and take in the original listed price

of the game and divide it by this number so that way we can end up with a DPM: dollars

per minute enjoyed.

Now, it’s hard to decide if you want a high or a low DPM, because some people want the

most bang for their buck, while others are willing to spend a little bit more for a really

well-enjoyed minute.

But just to standardize this, I'm going to assume lower is better — that means you've

paid less per minute you've enjoyed — and that way I can use it to divide literally

the rest of the equation.

HOW BOUT THEM GRAPHICS?

In the past few years, people have cared less and less about how many

polygons you've got on the screen and more about the style.

But one thing that hasn't changed is frame rate.

People want the most frames per second.

So, factually, the more frames, the better.

That means we're going to go ahead and take the highest frame rate available in the game

and we're gonna multiply that by the seconds of average playthrough, again from howlongtobeat.com.

And that will give us the amount of frames per game.

The game frames mainframe.

But how many frames does a gamer game in the gameframe mainframe?

That's a good question.

Now if you go ahead and you take your frames per game and divide it by the number of gamers,

I’m talking about however many copies have been sold or however many number of downloads

there have been, then that's going to leave you with frames per game per gamer, and that’s

a really important number, because if you have 200,000 frames per game and you have

200,000 gamers, that's 200,000 gamers that have only had one frame per game per gamer.

And that is no good, is it?

Is it?

I actually have... um, I'm a little confused now.

We're gonna take frames per game per gamer and we're gonna put it on the top of this

equation, because we want it to be the biggest number possible.

And now it’s time for cultural relevancy.

We want our games of the year to be big and brash and bold and boisterous, letting people

outside of the gaming world know,

Hey!

This is a thing!

So how do we judge a game’s effect on the world at large?

Well, we go ahead and we take all of the Google results that come up when you search

the game's full name and the word game.

But that’s not everything, right?

That's just the bare minimum.

It's like saying, “This dude’s bad haircut is important just because a lot of people are talking about it,”

which I know isn’t true from personal experience.

So I went on twitter and I asked you lovely folks what descriptors you expect to see in

descriptions of games of the year.

And you gave me a lot.

So I went ahead and I plugged all those into Google’s advanced search along with the

game's name, and I took those results and I multiplied it by the base Google search.

And I got very big numbers.

But don't worry, we're going to bring these numbers down to size, because some of the

descriptions you sent in were actually pretty negative descriptions of games.

So I did a Google search using those descriptions, and then I multiplied those results by one

plus the number of Funko Pops made of characters in the game,

which is objectively a terrible thing.

Now this is going to leave you with BCE, or your base cultural effect, and we're gonna

multiply that by our FPGPG in order to get a pretty big number.

But before we’re done with cultural effect, I want you to ask yourself, is this the culture at large?

Does this go outside of our gaming bubble?

There’s really only one way to tell that, and that's by using the M.O.M. variable,

which stands for: "My Own Mother."

So I called my own mother for help.

"Hello, Brian, I'm a follower and a subscriber as well as your mother."

Brian - "That's very good to hear.

I... you support me so well and I appreciate that.

I should ask you, Mom, would you consider yourself a gamer?"

Mom - "When I play Mario Kart with, like, grandchildren and things like that, I always

go off the road."

Brian - "That's, but, on purpose to let them feel better."

Mom - "Very similar to my real-life driving skills, I find."

Brian - "I have a list of 181 video games, now I know that's a lot.

I'm basically gonna run through this, and I'm gonna ask you if you have heard of this game.

Red Dead Redemption 2."

Mom - "No."

Brian - "God of War."

Mom - "Yes!

I have heard of that."

Brian - "Oh, OK!"

While subjecting my mom to a litany of 2018's best games,

it became clear that she was very interested in the topic.

Brian - "We're only 57 in, so we've still got another 130 to go."

Mom - "I can't tell you how, what an exciting time this is for me."

Brian - "Now you get taste of what it's like to do my job."

Mom - "I tell you what, this is a lot of research into things that really have very little meaning."

Brian - "You're right.

It is."

So once I had asked my mom about all of the games from the game of the year list, I was

able to throw it into a boolean function.

If mom knows game equals true, then that’s a plus one here.

And then I could raise our base cultural effect to the power of mom, so if she doesn't know

it, that's just to the power of one.

If she does, that's to the power of two.

Finally, it’s time for our fourth, and perhaps most important criteria: Is this game art?

And when you start asking if something is art, then you really end up asking,

"Why should we even be defining what is and isn't art?"

And the only thing worse than discourse about "are games art?" is

the discourse ABOUT the discourse of "are games art?"

Look, art is experiential and that's a beautiful thing that should be allowed to flourish without

having some pseudoscientific proof of greatness thrust upon it.

Which is why I'm not proving greatness.

Instead, this part of the formula is so revolutionary because I am proving art.

So let's go ahead and throw this into...

Shit, I ran out of space.

You know what, this part wasn't that important.

We're just gonna cut it.

This big GOTY equation ends up with very large numbers, which would be too hard to show all of.

So I needed to make a new unit.

Something I could reduce them all down to.

I plugged in my favorite game of the year, Celeste, and I used that to be our new baseline.

Celeste equals one BDG.

Or Big Determinant of Game.

Everything else will be reduced down using Celeste’s score to a scale of BDGs.

So that's it.

That’s the entire formula.

And if you'll excuse me, I have to go do my dark bidding on these spreadsheets and I will

come back to you right now.

December 30th.

New year is at our doorstep.

Knock knock!

Who’s there?

It’s 2019!

Come on in, hope you're not as big of an asshole as the past few of your friends!

I spent the past two weeks crunching the numbers, and it is my honor to announce that

2018’s scientifically calculated game of the year, with 19...

trillion BDGs...

is Fortnite.

That can't be the right number, I'm gonna...

No, that's right.

You remember when Pluto stopped being a planet, and the scientists were like,

"Hey, that's just what the definitions say!"

And we were like,

"Hey, scientists, maybe your definitions are busted!"

Maybe my formula is busted.

The fact that God of War got 2.1 million BDGs and Red Dead Redemption 2 got 0.1 BDG...

Maybe I shouldn't have made my mom's knowledge of the game an exponential factor.

Brian - "You know Tetris.

You would really like this Tetris..."

Mom - *sings the entire Tetris song*

No, I stand by that decision.

Let’s be honest, the stats I was using definitely favored cultural importance, and Fortnite’s

cultural effect was orders of magnitude larger than any other game this year.

And though I've never played Fortnite

— which proves my lack of bias and also that I’m professionally irresponsible —

there can be no denying that it has made a lasting impact

outside of the video game world.

It’s the only nonseries game that my mom knew about.

And regardless of how you feel about the Fortnite, it drew together a collection of people that

might not have otherwise connected, and that’s a valuable thing.

And even when your Uncle Devin comes up to you at the holiday get together and says,

“HEY BRIAN, WHAT IN THE HECK IS THIS FORTNITE THING?”

it gives you a common ground to chat,

and you really haven't chatted with Uncle Devin in a while.

You should call him more often.

He wants to show you his Civil War books.

And his collection of swords.

But if you’re upset, and you didn’t IMMEDIATELY close this YouTube tab to send me an angry tweet,

I’ve got an extra little gift for you.

It's a new formula.

GOTY equals x times 1 quadrillion.

And x equals your favorite game.

Of this year.

Now you can go ahead and tell your friends that Brian scientifically proved that my favorite game

is the game of the year, and then you can share them this link,

and then they won’t click on it because it’s a 15 minute video, so your secret is safe with me.

And to be honest, your favorite game deserves it,

because if you liked it enough to call it your game of the year,

then it must be pretty meaningful to you,

and no one can take that away.

So congratulations, Fortnite, and congratulations, your favorite game.

Here’s hoping 2019 is full of wonderful games and even more wonderful experiences.

*wink*

Happy New Year.

OH.

OH MY GOD THAT IS SO HOT.

OHHH MY GOD.

IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PROP WATER, PAT.

OH I PROBABLY JUST LIKE RUINED THIS MIC, TOO.

JESUS, PAT.

I TOLD YOU IT WAS PROP WATER.

GOD.

I'm okay.

Mom - "Does enthusiasm count or anything like that?

Should it just be, or just be, just bare bones..."

Brian - "Mom, to be honest, I don't think you can do this not enthusiastically, so,

you're gonna be fine." 
 2020-06-25 16:20:08,559 - DEBUG - file running:  PC gaming is a vast ocean of entertainment,

and if you want to explore, all you have to do is sail out.

And speaking of selling out,

this is my first-ever sponsored video!

That's right, the-

the folks over at Riot have decided to corporately sanction

a video from a man who is best known

for hanging sad clown portraits in his apartment.

You see, they just released VALORANT,

and since I'm currently stuck at home

they were kind enough to give me a budget

to help turbocharge my computer,

so that way I could unravel how to get good at PC gaming.

But the thing about VALORANT

is that you don't need a high-end PC to play it.

Riot told me that even on an old clunker

with minimum specs, you can still play competitively.

And sure enough, I excavated my ancient PC

in order to test this, and it played great.

- It plays great.

Oh, that doesn't count.

So I could use that sponsorship money

to soup up my computer or I could use it

to solve one of PC gaming's biggest problems.

Unlike a console, which can plug into a communal TV,

true PC gaming needs a dedicated space.

I live in a three-bedroom apartment with two other roommates

and they are not gonna be cool with me

setting up my sick rig in the spot where we keep

recycling that we haven't taken out in two weeks.

In fact, the only unused personal space I have

is this four-foot square right next to my radiator.

And I like to keep that block unused

for whenever I wanna feel like a rich person.

- Check me out!

But maybe, with a little help from my sponsor...'s money,

I can turn those 16 square feet into a gamer's paradise.

Today I'm teaching you how to make the perfect gamer space.

(lively dance music)

Oh!

Yeah!

For inspiration, I asked a couple coworkers

what they look for in a PC gaming space.

- Hi, I'm Jeff Ramos.

- I'm Julia.

If there was anyone at Polygon who could lead me

to gamer space perfection it would be Jeff and Julia,

and in our discussions it became clear

that there are four major elements

to a good gaming environment.

The first is a solid foundation.

If I want to build a PC gaming space,

where should I start?

- First, I think you need a computer.

- Check!

But without these other foundational elements,

I'll have less of a gamer space

and more of an ominous obelisk.

From there, you can start embellishing your foundation

with element two, a virtual gaming space,

which is just a fancy way of saying

a place you can stream games from.

- It made me feel a little less lonely

as I'm studying and stuff,

because there's just like a voice.

And I guess I wanted to do that for people, also.

- Streaming for you was less about

getting big and it was more about

sharing an experience with your friends.

- If I got big along the way I would be like, "That's fine."

- Element three is aesthetics.

If you're gonna spend hours at your computer,

at the very least it should be nice to look at,

and it should represent you.

- Everything else at my desk is black.

There's very little decoration, and I like that

'cause it's clear mind, I can just focus

on what I'm doing at any given moment,

versus looking at a desk full of Funko Pops.

- I had, I think, this specific Pop figure

of Vi from "League of Legends."

and then it just kind of expanded.

Since I work from home, too,

I try to make my space fun and engaging.

- And the final element: Caters to bodily needs.

- What type of chair is that that you're sitting in?

- Oh, it's a terrible one and it's going to be replaced.

And it gives me consistent back pain.

- Does that affect your gaming at all?

- If I'm not comfortable, then I'm just thinking,

"Dang, my butt hurts, my back hurts,"

and then I can't pay attention to things.

- Do you ever eat near your computer?

Do you ever have to refuel?

- I try to separate eating from my desk space.

There is a space off to the left where I usually

will always have a coffee cup and a water bottle,

and sometimes there'll be like a snack.

- When you're in the throes of a match,

you don't wanna be worried about your back hurting

or feeling a little famished,

and that means your gamer space should provide

the fuel and comfort your body needs.

If you can amalgamate these four elements,

you'll have a good gamer space.

But I'm making the perfect one.

And how can we prove it's perfect?

An increase in gaming performance!

Ha ha, you thought I wasn't gonna do

what I was sponsored to do!

Get outta here, I'm just killin' two birds with one stone!

My coworkers said in no uncertain terms

that a good gamer space will make me a better gamer.

Once I have a dedicated space,

that's gonna be all I'm gonna need

in order to be proficient at this game?

- Well, you should still practice a little bit, I mean--

- Though I normally don't let little things like rules

stand between me and victory,

"Valorant" has anti-cheat software

that kinda makes that impossible,

so there really is no way for me

to get good at this game without practicing.

But a perfect gamer space will envelop me

in a cocoon of learning,

shutting out the world around me.

By the end of this build, I'll prove

that I've developed a perfect gamer space

by showing just how much better at PC gaming I've become.

Luckily, that's not a very high bar.

That doesn't count.

And with my four elements defined, it was time to start.

I taped out the four-by-four square

and purchased a desk that would fit within the perimeter,

built the desk, got the monitor unpacked,

computer, keyboard, mouse in position,

and we were in business.

Element one, check.

I hopped right into "Valorant," and things were going

way better than with my coffee table setup.

And in hindsight,

maybe I should've stopped there.

But I still had money to burn.

You see, I really was getting better at "Valorant,"

but I had no way of clearly showing

just how well I was doing.

And as Jeff said--

- 'Cause if I no-scope and there's no one around to see it,

then does it matter?

- I ordered a nice microphone and got out my old webcam

to set up my streaming space.

All right, check, check.

We are set to go, everything looks great on the... game.

Things do not look as great...

Although I was prepared to start gaming for the masses,

my room was not.

I can do better than this.

If I go live with this setup,

everyone's gonna make fun of my finger-jointed

builder's-grade garbage molding!

I can't be known as the substandard molding guy.

Luckily, I had two sources of inspiration

for gamer space aesthetics on opposite

sides of the spectrum.

I wanted to land somewhere in the middle.

Obviously, the first step

was installing RGB LEDs, because a gamer space

without constantly changing rainbow lights

is like a little league coach without wraparound Oakleys.

I also purchased a modest number of game figurines,

because even with a sponsor,

hoo boy, those things are expensive.

But at the end of this, my space still felt pretty empty,

so I gathered all the figurines I could find.

All of them.

Beyond this, there was nothing behind me

to brand me as a true gamer for the stream viewers,

so I mocked up a quick poster idea

and sent it over to my coworker Pat

for some illustration work,

and used a little bit more of that sponsor money

to purchase a large cloth banner.

Oh my god.

It's perfect.

Finally, I purchased a video game-themed birthday party set,

and with that my aesthetic was complete.

What's up, y'all!

I am back at it at the streaming setup.

We've got everyone here.

You can tell, as I always say back there,

don't talk to me before I've had my gaming.

I just have a little, there's actually nothing in this cup.

I should probably get something into this cup.

Jeff warned me about keeping snacks off my desk,

but I was worried about getting hangry

in the middle of gaming.

So I prepped some peanut butter toast.

Also, Julia had a specific piece of advice

about emotional needs.

- I have one of the guy from Beastars,

so when I get too mad about playing video games

I can look at him and he'll soothe me.

- Though the sight of an anthropomorphic wolf

isn't necessarily soothing to me,

I do think it's important for me to have something

to calm me down after the rough matches:

Warm milk.

And I still had some sponsorship money left over,

so I purchased myself a gamer chair.

Unfortunately, the only one that could ship in time

was the largest size, which meant

I had to rearrange some furniture.

And with that, the perfect gamer space was complete,

all four elements checked.

The gamer space is created,

and all that's left for me to do

is be the gamer within the space.

I played a few matches, taking a sip from the warm milk

any time I got a little flustered.

But for some reason, I wasn't much better

than when I started this journey.

It's just that my wrists hurt.

That's the only reason why things aren't going great.

Even after running to the drugstore

to pick up some compression braces,

my gaming didn't improve.

It didn't make any sense.

I had spent over a week building this gamer space,

which included dozens of minutes playing VALORANT.

Why wasn't I any better?

The space isn't perfect yet.

That's the only explanation.

I hadn't reached my goal of being a better PC gamer.

But I also hadn't run out of sponsor money.

It was time for a second pass.

My single monitor wasn't giving me

enough screen real estate for what really mattered:

My stream setup.

So I got a second one, and also some nice lights.

We have now upgraded our new space.

I can now see my game, and I can also see

what my stream setup's gonna be.

It's lookin' good.

Enough.

But good enough is never enough

when one is striving for perfection.

The problem with streaming is that most people are okay

with one camera and one game.

I am an auteur who understand the importance

of cilimintography, and if I'm supposed to stream

in a manner that matches my ourverver,

I NEED.

MORE.

CAMERAS.

Sadly, pretty much every webcam is currently sold out.

I was running low on time,

and that's one thing sponsor money can't buy.

But it can buy enterprise level

video conferencing solutions.

Just wanted to check in really quickly

to let you know that

I am unstoppable!

*CACKLING*

- [Roommate] Brian!

- Sorry.

I figured out how to do three cams on OBS,

and now I can play a game.

Which is great, except looking at the overlay,

it's a little busy.

Our little test proved that there were

two big issues with our space.

The first was that the cameras took up most of the screen.

The second is that my roommates didn't enjoy hearing me yell,

which is nothing new.

But that's when it hit me.

I have a plan on how to kill two birds with one stone:

By recycling all of the boxes I've received.

If I could create a soundproof box around my gamer space

and cover it in a green screen,

then I'd have more screen space

and my roommates would stop yelling at me.

So I used more of my sponsorship money

to buy a bunch of expensive studio foam,

and I taped it to a bunch of cardboard.

And then I threw a green screen over the top of it

and viola, a hermetically sealed gamer space.

Now, a few of you might be wondering,

"How does one get into this space?"

But you'll see that right behind my air conditioning unit,

there's a way that I can crawl underneath there.

And the best part about it, it's not even dark

because we've got the... I put in the LEDs!

All I have to do is just weasel my way in.

They say, "No pain, no gain."

And you know, I'm a gamer

"No pame, no game."

Maybe that's better than my current slogan.

Oh, get the head through first,

'cause that's the hardest part of it, you know.

Just kinda like...

being born.

Ah, okay.

Oh.

Do a quick one 180.

And then you swap up, and then you're here.

And then you're in the,

(sighs) and then you're in the gamer space.

As easy as pie.

After a vigorous four-minute entrance,

it was clear that things were working out great.

Check this out!

Look, there's so much I can,

you can see the whole UI.

So there is the problem of these screens.

I spend a lot of time trying to make sure

that I had a cool-looking background.

Such is the curse of the green screen.

Though you can put anything behind it,

sometimes you are left with the void.

I worked so hard to make sure

that my background expressed my gamerhood,

and the gamer box just covered it up.

I wanted to digitally recreate it,

but since I had three cameras it would have to be in 3D.

So I reached out to my coworker Jenna

to mock something up in Blender for me,

based on some previous images I had of my gamer space.

Okay, so we just got the new background set up.

Let's get up in here!

Alrighty, okay.

(grunting) Okay!

I can...

Shit.

(groans) My shirt got caught on a thing.

This was a rude awakening, but a necessary one.

My current clothing setup was not compatible

with the gaming rig, so I figured out a new way

to kill two birds with one stone.

The idea came from my compression braces.

My wrists felt so much better while compressed,

and it made me wonder:

What if all of me was compressed?

So I looked up those tactical black skin suits

that athletes wear in the Olympics,

but I was running dangerously low on time and money

so I had to order from a less-than-scrupulous vendor.

And when it finally arrived it was not to my specifications.

I didn't have any more time.

The deadline was fast approaching.

So I dealt with what I had,

crawled into my sweltering gamer space and--

I see what the problem is now.

My new compression suit was causing me

to dissolve into Jenna's wonderful background.

So I asked her to remodel it,

this time with a 3D photorealistic virtual Brian

that I could superimpose my face onto.

And the worst part of it was that--

And I forgot my snacks!

But in all tribulations there is a chance for greatness,

and greatness was found with a little inspiration,

a little heat exhaustion

and the very last of my sponsorship money.

I'm covered head to toe in this important green screen,

and I don't want this to get marred, obviously.

So what I've come up with,

instead of having to eat toast with my hands,

is that I've purchased

a horse feedbag.

And I was worried about, you know,

my hot milk is gonna start to cool down.

And my computer right now is running a little bit hot, too.

Why don't I just kill two birds with one stone?

There are tons of liquid-cooled computers out there,

and if I use this tubing, I can feed the cool milk

through the PC, cooling it down perfectly,

up around my headset, over the microphone.

Okay, I got my feedbag, which will allow me to eat my snacks

and then I've got my warm milk, which is also

gonna be cooling my computer in the box.

I'll have my snacks and I'll have my box,

and I can stay in there.

With the invention of the milk-cooled PC, patent pending,

and the feedback-sustained me, patent pending,

the perfect gamer space was complete.

Okay.

(grunts) Hello!

Gamers.

I have my feedbag, I tossed it over beforehand.

The crown of it all,

my milk-cooled PC.

(Brian panting)

Let's get gamin'.

Thought the feedbag worked wonders,

I was still doing poorly in my matches.

I was getting flustered and couldn't focus,

but that's nothing a little warm milk couldn't help.

Come on! (groans)

See, I don't get, oh, no no no no no, stop!

No no no, uh, shit!

Shit, shit!

Ah!

Oh, this is bad!

This is very bad!

This is very bad!

After mopping up the MILK MSTR's lactose coolant fluid

and toweling myself off,

I broke out the gaming laptop I borrowed from work

and sat back down in my original VALORANT test position.

And I was better.

Without the lights and the monitors

and the hands-free snacks,

I was gaming better on a coffee table

than in my dedicated space.

So did I screw up

and kill too many birds with too few stones?

Or was I a less than perfect gamer?

Perhaps I was asking a toddler to pilot a helicopter.

There's nothing wrong with

my hot cardboard box of gaming perfection.

I simply was not ready to handle it responsibly.

One day, I will reenter that cocoon

and emerge a wonderful gaming butterfly.

But before I grow my wings,

this little grub must learn to crawl.

And also how to defuse the spike without dying.

It seems impossible.

Has anyone done it yet?

I doubt anyone's done that yet.

That's ridiculous.

(cheery music)

Oh, I'm so dumb.

I screwed it in the wrong way.

- [Karen] I didn't wanna say nothin'.

- You didn't wanna say nothin'?

- [Karen] Well, I looked at it and I knew.

- You looked at it and you knew?

- [Karen] Yeah. (laughs)

- And you didn't say nothin'?

No! 
 2020-06-25 16:20:08,560 - DEBUG - file running:  Kingdom Hearts 3 is finally here.

And I have received an excessive amount of requests to explain the storyline.

That seems perfectly reasonable.

You want to be caught up before you hop into the third game.

But judging by the wording on a few of these requests, it seems like I have a…

TALL TASK

ahead of me.

But could I possibly help you understand the gargantuan, magnificent,

epic storyline of Kingdom Hearts?

You sweet summer child.

You babe swaddled in the cashmere blanket of ignorance.

YOU ASK TOO LITTLE OF ME.

Because not only can I help you understand Kingdom Hearts.

But I will give you the tools necessary to understand any story you are ever faced with

for the rest of your life.

*music plays*

Please, oh baby, don’t go.

~Simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonight.~

*CLAP CLAP*

Spoiler Warning!

I’m about to explain the entirety of the Kingdom Hearts series.

Now, if you don’t want to be spoiled for all of the games released up until now…

I don’t know why you clicked on this video.

Because I feel like the title kinda explained that that’s what I was gonna do.

So that’s on you.

Uh, but ALSO.

Potential spoiler warning!

You see, when I explain the tools of the literary trade, I might just be able to accurately

predict the true ending of Kingdom Hearts 3.

Now, the game hasn’t been released yet, and I have not played it, but…

Consider yourself warned.

We’re talking about the hero’s journey or the monomyth.

This is a concept that’s been around for a long time.

But it was popularized by a guy named Joseph Campbell back in 1949 when he released a book

called The Hero with a Thousand Faces.

Campbell inspired plenty of other creative writers and literary analysts, including a

guy called Christopher Vogler, who wrote his own book in the 1990s.

But before that, in the 1980s, he was working as a story consultant for a little company

called Disney.

When he was there, he sent out a seven-page memo that basically broke down all the big

ideas from Campbell’s book into 12 simple steps to writing good stories.

Did the memo work?

I don’t know.

Why don’t you ask Timon and Pumbaa?

They…

They’re from the Lion King.

That was a movie that Disney Produced.

A lot of people think it’s a great movie.

Kingdom Hearts as described by the monomyth.

We’ve got 12 stages up here, kinda like a clock.

It’s a story wheel.

And I’ll go through piece by piece explaining Kingdom Hearts 1, so that way you can understand

what these stages are.

Once you do understand these stages, you’ll be able to understand any story!

Because great writers, no matter how dense their sci-fi or fantasy world may be, use

these stages to help orient you.

I’m talking Dune.

Harry Potter.

Space Jam.

Number one, introduction in the ordinary world.

In Kingdom Hearts 1, this is when Sora, Riku, and Kairi are all just hanging out on Destiny

Islands, doing normal kid stuff.

Call to adventure.

What’s this?

Weird creatures showing up on the island?

Sora has a sword that’s also a key?

Refusal of the call.

Now we hit a bit of a hiccup here because he really does seem gung-ho to leave the island

at some point.

But I don’t think he wanted to do it on these terms, so I’ll still call this a refusal.

Meeting with the mentor.

At this point Sora is in Traverse Town, and he meets Leon, who ends up giving him some

guidance on what he’s supposed to be doing.

Crossing the threshold.

Or as true literary critics call it…

boarding the gummi ship.

Tests, allies, and enemies.

This is pretty much the entirety of the Disney worlds.

You’ll notice that a lot of times in these synopses of Kingdom Hearts,

people just skip over them.

It’s cause they all fit here.

Reaching the innermost cave.

This is such a pivotal moment in the story.

In Star Wars, this is when Luke goes into the cave and faces off against a shadow version

of himself.

And in Kingdom Hearts, this is when Sora goes into Hollow Bastion so he can fight Riku, who is

actually being possessed by Ansem, who is the Heartless version of Terra-Xehanort, who

was originally Terra but was then possessed by Xehanort before him.

Same thing.

Enduring the supreme ordeal.

After Sora has faced off against Ansem the first time, he has to stab his own heart with

a keyblade, so that way he can release it and save Kairi.

That’s a supreme ordeal.

Seizing the sword.

Now this is not a literal sword.

Obviously, Sora already has one of those.

But instead it’s the reward or the power that Sora can take with him.

So in this case, it’s him being resurrected, having all of the princesses of heart saved,

and having the power to defeat Ansem.

The road back.

Ansem has been defeated by Kingdom Hearts being opened and him being ripped apart by

the light.

And they are able to seal the doors, but unfortunately, they lose two of their friends in the process.

Resurrection.

Yeah, Sora did get literally resurrected a few stages before this.

Uh, but this is more of a metaphysical resurrection.

Them finally coming back from the brink.

Kairi going back to Destiny Islands.

Return with the elixir.

Sora, Donald, and Goofy all go back out, using their combined experience to try to save Mickey

and Riku.

And that's Kingdom Hearts!

That was pretty painless, don't you think?

But granted, that's not what people have an issue with.

People have an issue with all of the overarching story of Kingdom Hearts.

But, again, as long as we stick to these 12 stages, we should be able to take this apart,

piece by piece.

And though I am gonna stick with the 12 stages, I am gonna add just, uh, one little extra piece.

It's called historical background.

This is like The Silmarillion.

Or JK Rowling's twitter.

In Kingdom Hearts, this would be Union Cross, or Chi, or whatever the many names of this

web/mobile game ended up being.

Die-hard fans will get upset with me if I say this doesn't really matter to Sora's overarching story.

But I'm gonna say it anyway.

So this historical background is gonna just be up here.

And all of that knowledge is just gonna kind of bleed immediately into Kingdom Hearts 1.

Pat (offscreen): Uh, nope, you gotta do Birth by Sleep.

Pat: It's a prequel.

Brian: But, is Sora in it?

Pat: No.

No Sora.

Brian: Who's this guy, then?

Pat: That's Vanitas.

Brian: Why?

So I, uh, seem to have neglected, uh, like three other heroes' journeys in this hero's journey.

So I'm just gonna...

I'm gonna move these over a little bit so that way I can have a bit more space.

We, we do have to talk about Birth by Sleep.

Starting first with Terra's.

Um, now imagine it has all twelve of the stages of the hero's journey, I just didn't want

to write 'em all out, 'cause he gets norted, so he's not that good of a hero.

Same goes for Aqua, which is intersecting with Terra's.

And then we've got Ventus, who has the biggest bearing on Sora's hero's journey.

It means that it has to not only intersect over here with Terra and Aqua.

But, I'm sorry Vogler, I am gonna have to include another step on your hero's journey.

So here we've got the Ventus Diagram, uh, which intersects here at step point five.

The part of the hero's journey, uh, where the baby hero's heart goes and saves another boy.

That's the only big change we're gonna do to Vogler's story wheel.

Uh, everything else is gonna make sense in Kingdom Hearts.

And now we're going to take the wheel, uh, as if it is the overarching story of the entirety

of the games.

So Kingdom Hearts, the first one, instead of going from 1 all the way to 12, is actually

just gonna go from 0.5 to 5.

And then we start 5 immediately at Kingdom Hearts 2, which will begin with Sora...

Pat (offscreen): Nope.

Brian: What do you mean nope?

Pat: There's two more.

Once again I seem to have neglected a few, uh, interstitial pieces of Kingdom Hearts.

Chain of Memories and also three five eight days over two.

Which is a totally normal title.

It's totally fine, because it just fleshes out Sora's hero's journey.

And also... a different guy and his name is Roxas.

*pained expression*

I went ahead and I categorized Chain of Memories as a "hero's journey redux"

since Sora is just fighting against his own memories, the things that he has remembered

from the past hero's journey.

So it's just gonna hang out around here.

And then we have 358/2 Days, which follows Roxas, who is Sora's Nobody.

And a Nobody is like the shell of a person after they've released their heart.

358/2 Days happens then, and since it's the hero's Nobody, it's actually within the hero's

journey, doing its own thing.

Um, and, I'm gonna call this 4.5 remix.

This is a pivotal part of the hero's journey when, uh, the hero's shadow self goes off

and eats ice cream.

These two are tied together by a character named Xion, who works in Organization XIII

with Roxas, and also is made from the memories... of Sora.

She doesn't really have like a hero's journey...

I'll just tie it out for you.

And since this oblong actually crosses through the hero's journey twice, we're gonna make

this easy to remember and call it the

"Hero's Memories of the Hero's Journey Double Cross Oblong."

Or HMHJXXO.

In Kingdom Hearts 2, we start out with Roxas and Sora, and Roxas is on summer vacation.

We're gonna have him start over here and just kind of go all the way up to enduring the

supreme ordeal, where he finally gives up his body to Sora so Sora can be whole.

And we're just gonna call that "The Antihero's Cradle."

Alright, so, we're done with Roxas, we're back with Sora.

So this should be a breeze.

Kingdom Hearts 2.

Alright, he's already crossed the threshold.

He does the tests, allies, and enemies.

That's just the Disney stuff, we're gonna skip it.

He goes over, reaches the innermost cave, that would be the World that Never Was, where

he faces off against the supreme ordeal.

Xemnas, Organization XIII.

Seizes the sword.

He gets the power to close Kingdom Hearts.

And then finally, the road back.

They get home.

They get a letter from King Mickey, the contents of which will be revealed in...

Kingdom Hearts 3?

Pat (offscreen): No.

FUCK!

ALRIGHT ASSHOLES.

I have no more space here, so I made you a DATA CUBE.

ARE YA HAPPY?

The data cube contains the entirety of Kingdom Hearts Coded, which is all in a virtual space.

The data cube is that thing where the hero goes on a journey into his inner thoughts

and finds some data that an old guy put in him.

It's that THING THAT HAPPENS IN THE HERO'S JOURNEY.

And then at the same time, we also have Dream Drop Distance, which... is another hero's

journey inside of the hero's journey, and it's part of seizing the sword.

Because they have to go... into sleeping versions of the world's they've already been to.

But also maybe they're... they're going into each other's dreams?

And one of them is...

No, it doesn't fit here, I've got a better...

There's another part of the hero's journey, and it's called the Dream Drop Bucket.

And it's where you put the Dream Drop Distance until you need it later, and hopefully you won't.

That brings us up to Kingdom Hearts 3.

Granted, I thought when I started this, I would be able to...

perfectly predict, uh, Kingdom Hearts 3.

But, I don't know, I feel like I"m just missing something.

*CAUSE He GeTs NOrTEd.*

*BeING POsESSed bY AnSEM.*

*By XeHAnORT.*

*CAUSE HE GETS NORTED.*

I forgot about the villain's journey.

The villain's tridecagon.

The villain's tridecagon is definitely the key.

The tridecagon of villainy.

This is a 13-sided shape that goes one further than dodecagon of the hero's journey.

We have almost entirely ignored Xehanort.

He is the impetus for all of the anger and anguish in Sora's life.

And so he deserves a wheel as well.

We have to start at the very beginning of Xehanort.

And that starts in stage one of all villains.

You have to be contacted by a future version of yourself.

That brings us to stage two.

It gives you the ability to time travel.

And that's what this means.

This special string just shows that they can go wherever they want to in time.

Step three, you need to learn about a great power.

This is when Xehanort first discovers Kingdom Hearts and all of the power it could hold.

What do you do after you find out about that power?

You nort a boy.

Once you've got that boy under your possession, time to get real into unethical science.

That's when you're going to learn all about Kingdom Hearts and how to release people's hearts.

That means you can become a guinea pig yourself, therefore creating two versions of yourself.

A Nobody and a Heartless.

But are you happy with just those two versions of yourself?

You shouldn't be!

'Cause you're a villain.

That's right, it's time for nort boy redux.

Stage eight.

This is when Ansem, the Heartless version of Terra-Xehanort, the original norted boy

form, takes control of Riku.

And now that you're jazzed and ready to go, time to fail.

You do have to fail once, uh, in order to succeed later as a villain.

But don't let that failure get you down, it's time for stage 10.

You develop an organization to trick young boy into committing Heartless genocide in order to create

a new pseudo version of that great power you discovered back in stage three.

And then you fail again.

But guess what!

It's time travel time.

Your young self is gonna help you out by coming from over in step two to step 12.

You just do the same tenth step again, except instead of using other people, you use 13

versions of your own self.

Which leads us to the thirteenth point in the tridecagon.

The villain's variable.

You're either gonna win, or you're gonna lose.

This is the thing that we were missing.

The villain's variable is what will tie together the rest of story.

It's what will help us understand what will happen in Kingdom Hearts 3.

And judging by the villain's tridecagon, I can say that I don't believe Sora will seal

away the darkness.

In fact I expect Xehanort to win...

by norting Sora.

And then think of the repercussions of this.

Donald will kill Goofy by throwing him off a dock.

Riku will start cutting his own bangs.

Kairi will continue to not matter.

It's so much more interesting.

It's the true way that this story should end.

And I think this is what people want.

This is the modern hero's journey.

The true thing that all stories should follow from here on out.

As Utada Hikaru would say: Simple and clean.

So the next time someone tells you, "I don't understand Kingdom Hearts!"

You say, "Hey Bucko.

I think what you don't understand is basic storytelling."

Basic storytelling.

Did that work?

I don't know.

Ask...

Aladdin.

Did the memo work?

Why don't you ask Sebastian the crab. *sings Under the Sea*

You nort a boy.

*laughing*

Pat (offscreen): Ohhh no. 
 2020-06-25 16:20:08,560 - DEBUG - file running:  *cheerful music*

Kirby!

This pink puffball has been sucking his way through the denizens of Dream Land since 1992.

He has his own games, manga, tv series, and toys.

It’s safe to say he’s one of Nintendo’s most trusted mascots.

But he should not be trusted.

The problem with Kirby is that he is simultaneously Nintendo’s simplest and most powerful creature.

Those two realities cannot coexist.

He is a life form with neither the ambition nor the intelligence to make decisions,

and yet the world bends to his will.

Although it appears that Kirby is just a vacuous pastel marshmallow,

there must be some hidden wisdom that grants him the power he wields.

There has to be.

Kirby’s incongruity is terrifying,

but that’s only because we are terrified of things we do not yet understand.

And today, we are going to understand.

"Scientia potentia est.” Knowledge is Power.

Humankind’s attempts to harness the powers of the natural world

come from intense research and understanding of those powers.

And yet Kirby is granted powers well beyond his station.

What powers, you ask? Allow me to show you.

I have created two columns here: Simplicity, and Power.

What Kirby is, versus What Kirby can do.

By mapping the dichotomy of these two columns, we can peel back the facade of Kirby’s simplicity,

and figure out what’s really going on.

Because, again, this is not normal.

Let’s begin with simplicity.

Most people know Kirby as that cute little round guy, but is there more to him?

According to official, canonical information:

no.

Does this sound like an apex predator?

Even a bear enjoys a satisfying back-scratch.

This sounds like the lowest form of life,

someone who is stuck on the base of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs.

He wakes up, eats his caloric intake for the day,

and falls asleep watching The Great British Bake Off.

And yet, over here on the power column...

The things Kirby eats are completely obliterated.

Not just converted into something else, completely gone.

Kirby only cares about eating and sleeping.

And yet, he gains no energy nor pleasure from consuming these things.

Instead, he just lets them disappear.

Gone from this plane of existence.

So…

what the fuck.

Kirby doesn’t speak a language beyond saying the words “Poyo,”

and “Hi!”

Kirby mostly communicates via body language and grunts.

Even toddlers are more communicative.

By all accounts, he is either incapable of, or uninterested in, speaking language.

And yet Kirby is an incredibly skilled technician.

We see Kirby piloting mechs, and if anime is to believed,

and I believe anime,

this can only be accomplished by gifted teens grappling with psychosexual ennui.

He can effortlessly turn himself into a fighter jet,

something that only the most skilled air force engineers have mastered.

How can he understand these complex mechanical processes,

without having the language skill to read a textbook

or the "I fucking love science" facebook page?

Kirby’s origins are vague.

Let me take a moment to move over to a different board so I can show you Kirby’s origin story.

There’s NOTHING HERE.

Very little is known about Kirby’s origin.

He has no canonical species. He has no canonical age.

Masahiro Sakurai, Kirby’s alleged creator,

has stated he does not remember how Kirby got his name.

Kirby was originally a placeholder sprite,

set to be replaced by something....

More!

But no. Kirby survived. Kirby came from nothing.

And Kirby is nothing.

Or is he everything.

Because Kirby can be anything.

His copy ability gives him the powers and appearance of any creature he consumes.

But copy is a misnomer.

He does not duplicate his enemies.

He assimilates and replaces them.

In Smash, he takes the power of his foes, and then the foe is released as a sign of respect.

But in every other iteration of Kirby, the thing he consumes is destroyed in the process.

Does he absorb their DNA? Does he absorb their memories?

Is he the keeper of their souls?

All of these abilities point to Kirby being intelligently designed, which we know is not the case.

Sakurai fucking woke up in a crop circle with the name “Kirby” carved into his arm.

Kirby has no emotional intelligence. No relationships.

In the anime, Kirby seems to harbor no ill will toward King Dedede or Escargoon,

his main two antagonists.

He faces baby birds and full battalions of soldiers with the same vacant grin.

He eats and destroys indiscriminately, but counts no one among his enemies.

But those who count him among theirs…

are cosmic horrors.

Look at this thing.

Look at this thing!

These celestial powers probably have wants and needs far beyond our human comprehension,

and yet they trouble themselves with the destruction of Kirby,

a barely living kickball.

What do they see in Kirby that scares them?

What could scare this?

And the final simple evidence, Kirby is shaped like a friend.

This was the opening of Kirby’s Adventure. Let me show you something.

What did you notice?

That’s right. For the entire time I was drawing this,

I WASN’T INTERROGATING the true nature of Kirby.

This quote is cute and simple and a blatant misdirection.

It is a patronizing errand is meant to keep people like me from uncovering the truth.

The truth that Kirby possesses infinite power.

And that is a quote.

Planet Robobot explicitly states that Kirby possesses infinite power.

Kirby can ride a star. Kirby can punch through a planet.

Kirby is the only being in the entirety of the universe that survived the Galeem cataclysm.

A circle survived.

THIS SURVIVED.

HOW?

*deep breath*

Now that we’ve addressed these two columns, it is time to bridge the gap.

How can we reconcile the two canonical truths of Kirby:

that he is both nothing and everything.

How can this sentient garbage bag accomplish so much?

Let me tell you...

I don’t know.

I literally have no clue how this dumb fucking orb can have so much power.

I have worked my whole life researching and gaining knowledge,

and this dipshit sphere sleeps all day and has powers that gods fear.

And that’s impossible.

It should be impossible.

There has to be an answer here and I don’t see it and that’s NOT FAIR.

If knowledge is power, then power should be knowledge,

and Kirby is everything and he should know everything,

and yet we know nothing!

I can’t think in here.

I’m going outside!

How do I get outside?

Kirby!

The mystery of this florid Dream Landian has baffled me,

but I've taken a few months, and I've collected my thoughts,

and I’m back in the studio to deliver my findings.

Kirby’s incongruity is terrifying, but that’s only because we are terrified of things we do not yet understand.

And today, for real,

we are going to understand.

If you’ll recall from our first exploration of the rosy nightmare,

the problem with Kirby is that he is both incredibly simple and incredibly powerful.

In the intervening five months, I’ve learned a few pieces of information that contradict a few of my points.

First, Kirby can speak a language.

There was a Drama CD released in Japan in 1994 where Kirby speaks full sentences.

But in this, he says that a phone is “mysterious” and he doesn’t know how it works.

And yet, he can pilot a mech.

Two, Kirby’s name does in fact have a backstory,

even if Sakurai was too fuckin' zooted to remember it.

Kirby was named after John Kirby, a lawyer who passed away last year,

who defended Nintendo’s right to copyright Donkey Kong back in the ‘80s.

But this doesn’t make the rest of Kirby's origin any less vague,

and it doesn't change the fact that a creature cannot possibly embody both of these truths.

But that’s the problem.

I’ve been thinking of Kirby as a creature.

Consider, for a moment, Moby Dick.

You might receive this book in your English class and say,

"Hell yeah! A big ol’ whale?

I can’t wait to see Ahab level up and hit that big boy right in his weak points.

And sure, he puts his harpoon up in Moby D’s flanks,

but spoiler alert!

Ahab gets got,

even though he’s been grinding for, like, years

and Pale Whale's just a dipshit fish with a thing for sailor feet.

And so you say this to Ms. Mahoney and she’s like,

“Brian, don’t you get it? The whale is a metaphor for…

something,”

and then you write that on your final exam and you pass the class.

This is what I like to call “The Bookman’s Bluff.”

It’s when an author creates something, and people are like,

“Hey, that doesn’t make sense,”

but then the author says,

“Well, it does make sense if you consider it’s actually a metaphor.”

Here, I believe that Sakurai is pulling a Bookman’s Bluff.

Kirby, like Moby Dick, doesn’t make sense as a creature,

but he will make sense as a metaphor.

So what does Kirby symbolize?

Let’s take a look at some common metaphors.

Let's start with the seven deadly sins since everyone and their mother is basing characters on them.

Unfortunately, none of them really make sense for Kirby.

Wrath, no way. Greed, he’s not in it for the money.

I'm gonna skip over lust.

You could make an argument for Gluttony because he eats a lot.

Sloth, he sleeps a lot. And Envy, he's constantly copying other people.

But he never does it with any malice. Kirby does these things haphazardly,

without any sense of what he's doing.

And then there’s Pride.

Now, pride is the sin from which all other sins arise,

and its punishment in hell is being broken upon the wheel,

but Kirby is a wheel, so that ain’t gonna work.

But Kirby might symbolize someone else’s pride...

The Hubris of Humanity.

Think about it.

Has humanity ever paused to consider that perhaps our endless consumption

may not be a good move for the world as a whole?

Have we altered our course or simply continued to eat and sleep and copy others

without any thought of the repercussions?

In fact, perhaps we can go one step further. Kirby is a metaphor for capitalism!

Does our capitalist society assimilate and destroy?

Absolutely!

Technical and cultural appropriation are two of capitalism’s most trusted tools.

When it comes to a lack of emotional intelligence,

capitalism makes people willing to suck in and obliterate anything,

friend or foe, nation or natural wonder, so long as it makes money.

Is capitalism’s enemy a cosmic horror?

What could be more cosmically horrifying to a capitalist society

than a guy called Marx.

KIRBY IS A METAPHOR FOR CAPITALISM.

Sure, capitalism can sometimes be more cruel in its intentions than Kirby can manage.

That is... I'll take that.

Uh, also, it sure as hell feels like it could burn out at any second,

so the infinite power thing: not 100% true.

Um, and,

very-it's a-it’s hard to describe capitalism as being shaped like a friend…

and the whole eating and sleeping only is...

it doesn’t really make sense 'cause we have a hyper fixation on productivity and that being tied to worth…

so that doesn't...

This is not a very good metaphor, is it?

In fact, most of these metaphors are bullshit.

Especially this one.

I thought I could take five months and pause and contemplate,

and then I'd come back, and I'd have the perfect explanation for the dichotomy of Kirby,

but nothing has changed.

This horrifying bolus slips through my fingers again.

Maybe I’m just not good at this...

Jenna, can you...

I need you to keep my papers and push pins safe. I’m gonna go away for awhile…

I'm gonna find Kirby.

Jenna: Okay. Good luck bud.

I went to the woods because I wished to front only the essential facts of Kirby.

I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life,

just as Kirby might suck a Waddle Dee into his gullet.

I’ve been at it for a while now.

Judging by the length of my beard, I’ve been living out here for 2, maybe 3 years?

There are no pin boards in the forest.

I don’t have three cameras to catch my every side glance.

They don't teach you th...

It’s just me. And nature,

which has reduced me to my base instincts.

I only care about finding food and shelter,

eating and sleeping.

I am become Kirby.

I wish I could say this has given me a clear mind, but no,

nature has broken me.

I am confounded by it.

And we are terrified of things we do not yet understand.

Kirby is nature!

...I thought, after spending my first day out in the woods.

Sure, nature’s origins are still murky,

and what is evolution if not a really, really slow form of Kirby’s copy ability?

*inhaling*

And much like Kirby, Nature is neither cruel nor kind:

it doles out boons and punishments indiscriminately.

For every delicious handful of berries,

it also gives a completely unrelated bout of diarrhea.

But it took me only a few days to realize that this was another dead end.

Nature doesn’t destroy matter, or possess infinite power,

and its enemy is not a cosmic horror,

it’s us.

I'm sorry for using so much paper.

So I went back to the proverbial drawing board and have been stuck there ever since.

Nature is still terrifying to me.

And it is certainly not shaped like a friend.

How can Kirby live like this and stay so joyful?

How can he only care about his base needs and conquer any enemies that come before him?

I can’t conquer anything,

not even the mystery of a character from a children’s game.

All I can do is tumble listlessly through the wood,

like a star spat from Kirby’s maw.

*waves crashing*

I awake one morning upon the shore of a strange sea.

I do not know where I am, nor how I came to be here.

The sea stretches endlessly in front of me,

revealing the gentle, Kirby-like curve of the planet,

and I finally understand.

I was so focused on investigating the inner machinations of this bulbous boy

that I never asked why I was investigating.

I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things to mean something,

but Kirby didn’t need an explanation,

I did.

There is no bullet point or fan wiki entry.

Kirby is not nature or a metaphor.

Kirby doesn’t need a dark backstory or a logical rationale.

Kirby is just Kirby.

As I stand here watching the waves lap against the sand

miles away from civilization,

I realize I’m not simply standing on the edge of the ocean, but the edge of the world.

A world I’ve accepted without knowing its hidden meaning.

Perhaps there is no hidden meaning.

Perhaps it’s better that way.

Perhaps it’s time for me to go home.

“First you draw a circle,

then you dot the eyes.

Add a great big smile,

and presto, it’s Kirby.”

Kirby is an extremely strong circle,

and that’s all the explanation I need.

Unfortunately,

the same CANNOT BE SAID FOR DIDDY KONG.

WHO GAVE HIM A GUN? DID HE BUILD THE JETPACK?

THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE, HE'S A MONKEY, WHAT IS HE...

*suit ripping* Ahhh yeah!

This is satisfying. If you get in on this, you want to...

Pat: Yeah.

Brian: Roll... just put that in a bunch of dirt right now.

I'm gonna roll around a little bit.

*you hear a bunch of scrounging around*

*shirt ripping* Brian: Ohhhh incredible!

Pat: Are we gonna ride on the train like this to Coney Island?

Brian: Yeah maybe! 
 2020-06-25 16:20:08,560 - DEBUG - file running:  Mario!

He can jump, he can dance,

and he can successfully avoid conviction for war crimes.

It seems like the only thing he can’t do is settle down and just enjoy life for a bit.

Mario has been cleaning up messes in the Mushroom Kingdom and beyond since 1981.

That makes him almost 40 years old.

Most 40-year-olds I know are paying off a mortgage, buying a Peloton,

and desperately trying not to become their parents.

But Mario is still out there,

grinding at the same job,

and also, every other job.

Doesn’t Mario deserve some time off?

Doesn’t he get a chance to kick up his heels?

Enjoy a tropical drink while visiting the ol’ timeshare?

And more specifically, hasn’t he made enough coins to let him coast for the rest of his life?

That’s why I’m here to give him a little financial advice…

*ding!*

And figure out when Mario can retire.

*chalk board wheeling in*

Thank you both.

Why should Mario retire?

You might say “Mario loves his job,

and when you love what you do, you never work a day in your life,”

but that's bullshit.

I love what I do, and let me tell you something…

I’ve worked some days.

*threatening bass noise*

I personally can’t wait to retire.

As soon as I hit 50, I'm gonna be out there on the beach,

pina colada in one hand, sci-fi novel in the other,

soaking up mother nature's cosmic rays.

But Mario has a history of risk-taking behavior, and

it's possible he's planning to live fast, die young, and leave a beautiful, beautiful corpse.

That said, he’s made it out of every scrape so far,

and ground pounding at age 86 is hard on the hips.

Mario needs a backup plan.

Now, I’m not here to tell Mario how to live his life

*ding*

but I can take a look at his finances

and figure out when he’ll have enough money to finally hand Peach his resignation letter.

Foolish ol’ me thought that I could just google “how much money do you need to retire”

and there'd be a link that says “a million bucks,”

but no.

Turns out that everyone needs a different amount to retire based on what you’re used to.

If you’re making millions every year, you’re gonna need a lot more to retire,

because how else are you gonna support your dipshit failson’s bad business ideas?

But with all of the retirement calculators online, I was getting a little overwhelmed,

so I decided to reach out to a qualified financial advisor.

- Hi, my name’s Nate Choe, I’m a certified financial planner with Northwestern Mutual,

and I basically help people answer questions about money.

- That’s exactly what I need you to do today.

This call is not about me, um, I feel like I’m in a great spot right now in terms of my finances,

but I have some worries about my good friend, Mario.

I was looking online to see if there was, like, just a number of money you need in order to retire,

and it turns out that that’s not a thing that exists.

How do I figure out how much money you need to retire?

- Yeah, yeah, um, there are a lot of different things that you’d need to know.

At the most basic level, you need to know how many years you’re going to spend in retirement.

So basically, when you’re gonna retire, and at what age you’re going to die.

- So I have know, I have to be able to, uh,

to just discern when I’m willing to croak, is what you’re saying.

- Exactly, yes, you have to calculate a death at some point.

- Alright. What if I’m never gonna die.

- *chuckling* Then you’re never going to be able to retire.

And then you’ll need to know how much money you’re going to spend every single month…

- Okay…

- And then Nate listed off a bunch of other very important pieces of retirement info

and I paid close attention.

- Got it, okay.

I figure out how much money he’s gonna need per month, and then I’ll work backward from that,

based on how much money he can accrue, and then that will be how I can figure out when he can retire?

- That work backwards model is actually what we do in the industry,

but we have to offset what he has against inflation as well.

- Is there a minimum amount of money per month that you suggest people have for retirement?

- Yeah, typically, what we’re talking about, like, the average American,

it’s going to be about three thousand dollars a month, of today’s dollars.

- I feel like Mario is a very humble man,

and so I don’t think he’s going to need more than 3k a month, um,

just to make it easier for me.

So now that I’ve got a basic gist of the information I need to calculate Mario’s retirement age,

it’s time to collect the information.

Let’s start with something easygoing

and figure out when Mario's gonna die.

To keep things simple, we’ll assume that Mario was born the year he first made a game appearance.

This might not be perfectly accurate, but it would make him almost 39 years old,

and that feels pretty right for a strangely smooth-skinned mustachioed man.

Though current male life expectancy is around 80 years old,

I personally can’t come to grips with the fact that Mario is halfway through his life,

so I’ll be generous and say he’ll die at 90.

He’s spry.

In order to retire, Mario is going to need a monthly budget of at least three thousand US dollars,

but he uses coins.

Tons and tons of people have tried to figure out, how much a coin would be worth in US dollars,

but most of them have been thinking about coins as a solid gold object.

Judging by the amount of coins you need to purchase simple objects in the Mushroom Kingdom,

it seems like coins are not really worth that much.

Using Super Mario RPG as our guideline for a coin’s purchasing power,

the cheapest items are a mushroom and able juice: 4 coins a pop.

Shirt and pants are the cheapest nonconsumable items at 7 coins each.

I wanted to compare these with the most expensive items in Super Mario RPG,

but I don’t think I can figure out the real world price of a fire bomb

without getting put on a watch list.

After doing some heavy research, I settled on a conversion rate of 1 coin to 8 US Dollars.

Given our 3k figure for retirement,

that just means Mario needs 375 coins a month, right?

WRONG.

Super Mario RPG came out in 1996, and we haven’t accounted for inflation.

That’s why we gotta compare these prices to similar items Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga,

which came out seven years later.

I built my Mushroom Price Index on these six items, and just from a cursory glance,

it’s obvious that the prices have gone up.

But to figure out by how much, we gotta head back to algebra two.

The pert equation!

It's something I learned about a very long time ago,

and I’m pretty sure it’s used to figure out compounding interest.

Basically, I gotta plug in some prices and do some natural logs and

whatever else the internet tells me to do,

and it will leave me with an annual inflation rate for that item.

Then I just gotta average out the rates and it’ll leave me with a workable annual inflation rate

for the Mushroom Kingdom as a whole.

So I’ll just go ahead and do that math in my head real quick.

*thinking music*

Thank you, Clayton.

Now, rounding that number up, that’s an average annual inflation rate of about 15% per year.

Which is… really high.

The US Federal Reserve tries to keep inflation at a healthy 2%,

whereas the Mushroom Kingdom Federal Reserve doesn’t exist

due to aggressive lobbying by Wario.

In order to understand this a bit better, I googled Mario hyperinflation,

and I got some exciting search results

that were ultimately unhelpful.

But from what I gather, this means that if Mario spends 100 coins to buy a shirt this year,

next year, he'll have to spend a little more than 115 for the same shirt.

If inflation stayed the same from when Superstar Saga came out in 2003,

we can assume that by 2020, a simple mushroom is going to cost 128 coins.

A pair of entry level pants will cost 2049 coins.

So that original 1-to-8 conversion rate doesn’t really make sense anymore.

Using those same 2020 price comparisons,

the conversion rate is more like 36 coins to 1 US Dollar.

If Mario retired today, he would need 108,000 coins per month.

*MAMMA MIA!*

But let’s remember that Mario has been doing this for a long time. He’s definitely got a little something...

... away. So I talked to Nate about his job and ways he might be saving money.

- He has a bit of a strange job. He’s technically a plumber, I guess, in title?

- Is he part of, like, the plumber’s union? Does he have a pension?

- So I, I, I would be willing to bet he doesn’t have a pension just because, uh,

I think he might be the only plumber?

He’s not being employed by anyone, necessarily. He’s just doing it and then finding his payment along the way.

- Okay, so it sounds like he’s almost, like, a freelancer.

If he’s not getting W-2 income he can’t save into things like 401ks or Roth IRAs.

- Now, when you say Roth IRA, what is that?

- It’s a way to save for retirement.

Um,

you know, as a young person you should definitely be doing one, trying to max it out every single year.

It’s crucial for, for retirement.

- When…

But when you say crucial, do you…

do you mean optional?

So, maybe Mario doesn’t have a Rough IRA or a 4-in-1 Cake or whatever,

but no one has those. I don’t, and I’m well on my way to that beach chair in Boca!

And the fact is that Mario can get a lot of coins in his games.

How else could he spend so much on go-karting and tennis?

In the most recent Mario games, the coin counter can only go up to 9,999,

which is the maximum amount you can store in a mattress.

So let’s assume that Mario has been saving 10,000 coins every year since the release of Mario Odyssey.

We can assume that since he’s not in a union, he isn’t getting any raises to offset inflation.

So to finally figure out when Mario can retire, we need to know much money he’ll need every year before his death.

For example, if he lives to 90 years old, he’ll need 2.7 billion coins.

Which is the cost of living for just one year.

But we have to remember that he's been saving 10,000 coins for 54 years,

which means that he would have 540 thousand coins saved up… Which is…

point zero two percent

of what he needs to retire for just one year before his death.

And actually, if the monthly cost of living is already 108 thousand coins,

he's gonna be unbelievably deep in debt…

Which is actually what Nate told me, via text.

Mario can never retire.

You know what, that’s bonkers though, because there's...

there’s no way that, you know, inflation's gonna stay that high for that long.

In fact, in later Mario and Luigi RPGs, the prices are the same or lower.

So let’s just assume that from here on out the inflation rate stays a healthy 2%.

And you know what, let’s assume that Mario can save more than 10,000 coins a month.

In New Super Mario Bros. 2, the counter maxes out at one less than 10 million coins.

Granted, this is an outlier, and a ridiculous one at that,

but so is spending 2.7 billion coins just to survive at age 90.

There’s no way you could spend that much on Werther’s Originals.

So let’s say he's saving 10 million coins a year since age 31,

which, might I point out, is over a quarter of a million US Dollars.

Now if we just add up the cost of living of each year leading up to 90,

we can see that Mario will have saved enough money to chill out on his boat at age…

77.

Which is...

is just one year below the average American male life expectancy…

*I'M-A TIRED!*

Okay, you know what,

just for fun, let's just throw some random numbers in here, just to... just for...

just to see, you know, just wheaa- just for fun!

Let’s say Mario is starting to save money at, ppffff, I don’t know, my age, 26.

The inflation rate can stay the same, 2%,

and let's just say that the coin ratio is actually just 1-to-1 with US dollars,

so just he needs 3,000 coins today in order to retire.

And, and you know what, let’s, let's say he can save….

uhhh, psshhh, 10% of an average video producer’s salary in New York City.

Something completely random like that.

Assuming Mario lives to the ripe old age of 90,

we can just plug these figures into the equation

and figure out that Mario will be kickin' back on the white sands,

boombox blastin' Jimmy Buffett at the youthful retirement age of...

88?

Are you fucking kidding me?

Nononono... That can’t be right…

Because if Mario can’t retire,

then that would mean that I wo-

*uncomfortable silence*

Will you excuse me for a moment…

*tropical music playing in the background*

*Another day in paradise!*

*The sun is shining bright!*

*People laugh and people smile, 'cause everything feels alright!*

In order to understand this a little better, I googled Mario hyperinfla- *laughing* I just,

I'm sorry, I'm just accepting this now. I'm just accepting what I'm saying. 
 2020-06-25 16:20:08,561 - DEBUG - file running:  The Mega Man robot masters were not always evil.

In fact, most were mechanized workers, created specifically to make life on Earth more efficient

and wonderful.

AND THEN THAT MASSIVE DONGER,

DR. WILY, TURNED ‘EM ON US!

So Mega Man destroyed them, and the world was saved.

But... just how useful were these robots?

And were they useful enough to chance a robot uprising?

What if someone ranked every single Mega Man robot master from most to least useful to

see which ones were really worth the risk.

Someone should try to do that.

It’s me.

I’m the one who’s going to do that.

Before I get started on the gradient of worth it to not worth it, I’m gonna talk

about the protagonists, or “the good guys” even though some of them aren’t specifically good.

A lot of these robots were built to be sentient for the sake of being sentient, and I do not

feel at all qualified to discuss the philosophical implications of that.

So I’m gonna put ‘em over here.

Mega Man.

Mega Man X.

Mega Man red.

They’re all over here.

I’m not gonna touch that.

So what kind of robots are good when they’re sentient?

I think that it’s things humans cannot do.

Things that perhaps only a robot could do.

One that can think for itself would be pretty worthwhile.

So let’s start with those ones.

The ones that are good.

Number one: Chill Man.

Chill Man is a recent robot master who was built to help stop global warming.

And heaven knows we need that.

Definitely worthwhile.

Next is another cold friend: Freeze Man.

Freeze Man was built to make a non-polluting energy.

He would make that energy by splitting average temperatures

into hot temperatures and cold temperatures.

I’m choosing to think of that as something like nuclear fission as opposed to choosing

to think of it as dumb.

Commando Man.

Terrible name, but he was actually a minesweeping robot.

One of the first gens, Elec Man.

He controlled nuclear power plants.

He could help make sure the nuclear power plant was shut down in case anything bad ever

happened to one.

Hopefully it won’t!

SsssssSTAR MAN!

He was built to explore the universe.

Humans are real squishy, really, when you think about it.

It might be nice to have a man going out into the stars, a Star Man.

Also in his flavor text, he’s apparently a romantic and, like, loves poetry, and that’s

what we need out in the stars.

While he’s up there, Galaxy Man is helping figure out the trajectories.

Splash Woman!

She’s super useful because she goes and helps shipwrecked sailors, or just people

lost at sea.

I feel like she’d do a better job than, I dunno, the Coast Guard or whatever.

Not that I’m shitting on the Coast Guard.

They do do good…

I’m digging myself in a hole.

Wait, where’d Toad Man go?

*worry about Toad Man*

Where’s my guy Toad Man?

Toad Man.

He irrigates crops during drought.

Very useful.

Why’d they make him a toad?

Ice Man.

I swear we’ve got a lot of cold people up here at the front.

He’s built specifically to do human-like tasks in cold weather.

So he’s good!

More cold friends.

Blizzard Man.

There to help monitor the weather in arctic environments.

Looks and names can be deceiving, and Junk Man is super important.

Junk Man was built so he could find useable robot parts that have been left out.

Think about how much electronic waste we make.

It would be great if something could go dig through all of our trash and find the useable

circuit boards.

That’s important.

Hornet Man.

We’ve done some shit to bees y’all.

He pollinates the flowers.

Would be very useful if we continue to keep doing shit to bees.

And finally, we’ve got Cloud Man and Tornado Man.

They both are actually useful for, uh, controlling the weather when things are bad.

I’m gonna put Cloud Man in front of Tornado Man because Tornado Man, uh, was, was built

to stop tropical storms.

Which is not what a tornado is.

He needs a different name.

There we go.

These ones I would say are worth the risk.

We still have like 180 more to go.

We got a bunch of construction robots next.

We’ll start with everyone’s favorite: Guts Man.

Imagine there’s a line right here.

Maybe I’ll put it in in after effects.

That might be too much work.

I’m probably not gonna do that.

Good ones.

Now we’re into construction zone.

Guts Man comes first because he’s a civil engineer.

He’s not only strong and can lift big rocks, but he can build bridges probably.

We’ve got Aqua Man and Pump Man.

Both of them are used for water filtration.

I’m gonna put Aqua Man in front of Pump Man because Pump Man’s flavor text explains

that sometimes he’ll volunteer to wash off graffiti,

and no one likes a narc.

Bomb Man: bombs.

Ground Man: excavation.

Block Man: makes blocks.

Concrete Man: concrete.

Needle Man: needles.

I guess it’s drilling.

Drill Man: also drilling.

Bit Man, from the DOS game.

He is also a driller.

You think that after the first two went bad… they would’ve stopped making drill robots,

right?

Oil Man DOS.

He does oil… things.

Hard Man.

*trying to keep it together*

He doesn’t actually have a, um, flavor text explanation for what he is other than that

he is very heavy.

So I am assuming that he is for ground leveling.

Um.

But maybe he’s just big?

Impact Man: piling.

Cut Man: tree cutting.

Torch Man DOS: welding.

Fuse Man: electrical equipment management.

Oil Man: keeping things oiled.

Spark Man: making sparks!

I think he actually charges things.

Fire Man.

He was made to incinerate trash.

Bond Man.

He was supposed to be in the first game until they realized… he was just glue.

Stone Man.

I assume bricks, but actually they only say that he hangs out with Guts Man, so maybe

he’s just moral support.

Flame Man.

He generates thermal power.

But also he’s powered by thermal power?

Which seems recursive.

And also impossible.

Jewel Man.

He not only mines the jewels but he polishes them.

Finally, in the construction, it’s Slash Man.

He was specifically made to cut down trees so that you could build SECRET bases.

I don’t know why they insisted on saying it was for secret bases.

That seems like a waste of a robot.

To be perfectly honest, I don’t think we needed to make these ones sentient, because

you know what, Hard Man?

I think steamrollers were doing just fine.

Now we’re getting into a category I like to call…

Sure???

They’re not necessarily bad.

I just think we could probably do without Wind Man, who apparently helps with the harvest…

with fans.

Astro Man, who just works in a planetarium.

Gravity Man.

He can control gravity which could be useful?

Dive Man.

He was built to catch fish with torpedoes.

They made him look like a submarine and they gave him torpedoes.

Feel like they should’ve seen this coming.

Solar Man.

Now he investigates solar things, I guess.

He also apparently developed an exercise routine.

I don’t know why they needed to put that in the flavor text, but it definitely put

him in the “Sure???” category.

Top Man.

I’ll give ya…

I’ll give you a guess about what he does.

Did you guess “explore other planets?”

Because yeah, that’s what he was designed for.

Why the FUCK is he a top?

God these are all so good.

We’re getting into the categories where I can’t stop laugh…

*clears throat* *deep breath*

Serious.

Snake Man.

*laughter from everyone in the studio*

He, uh, was supposed to explore other planets

that had crevasses.

And he’s a snake.

Gyro Man.

He was supposed to be a really good plane, but then Wily ran out of money, so they just

stuck a propellor on his back.

Plant Man manages plants.

Pharaoh Man.

Only supposed to explore ruins.

Blast Man.

He manages fireworks.

Fireworks are dangerous.

Don’t play with fireworks.

But also, maybe, don’t make a robot to play with them.

I love Nitro Man.

I’m gonna be honest, I do feel kind of bad putting him into the “Sure???” category.

Uh, because Nitro Man was built specifically to do motorcycle stunts in movies.

The thing I really love about Nitro Man is that he’s the president of a stunt robot club.

Which I think is just wonderful.

He’s still not useful.

Here’s where thing get a little bit difficult for me.

Burst Man was built to be a guard.

I’m not sure about robot, highly armed guards.

But since he was specifically a guard…

I keep saying specifically.

I figure, like, that’s still defensive, and so…

I’ll put him here.

But it’s a good segue!

In the Mega Man games, not every robot was made by Dr. Wily or Dr. Light.

And in fact, there were some robots that were made by other robots.

Or were made extraterrestrially.

Or were made specifically as a joke, like “I can’t find my keys, man!”

I’m gonna put them kind of as the split in the middle to say, “Hey, these are nebulous,

but they’re definitely not good.”

Now that we’ve got this hard line of good to bad, even though, to be honest, I think

that the line should be here.

It’s time for us to talk about the bad robots.

J.J. Abrams.

Some of these robots were built specifically to murder.

We can all agree that that is bad.

I’m gonna put all of these murder robots over on the very bad side.

We also have a bunch of characters that are Sonic robots.

That is an affront to nature.

They’re in the bad side, too.

I also didn’t even print out all of the NetNavis from Mega Man Battle Network even

though I love those games because those were software built with the specific intention

of being mean online.

And that’s just Twitter.

I do just want to point out Aircon Man, who was a robot sent from the future to destroy

the world.

And he’s also an air conditioning unit.

Now *kick* let’s get into the fun part.

These robots have absolutely no reason to be sentient.

Chemistry Man.

He’s from the new cartoon.

He apparently taught chemistry classes that were so boring, he put kids to sleep.

And then he took it really personally, and decided to become evil.

Sheep Man.

He’s a shepard actually.

Tundra Man.

Built to do similar things to all of the high echelon frozen people, but I’m including

him over here because he got really bored at his job and then decided to become

an ice skater.

This is why you don’t make sentient robots, I guess.

Hypno Woman.

She was a therapist who hypnotized people into bad things.

DJ Jazzy J4-8950…

is a boombox.

You are a magnet.

Plug Man charged electrical things.

Like a plug could do.

Strike Man sounds cool, but he’s just a baseball throwing machine.

It’s me.

Spring Man can… jump?

Bright Man.

Built to explore dark places.

Kinda like a FLASHLIGHT.

Cold Man’s a refrigerator.

Seriously.

Sword Man.

He was developed to hold a sword that Wily stole from a place.

He’s not a sentient murder robot.

He’s a sentient picture frame.

Things that don’t really need to be sentient?

A vacuum.

It’s Dust Man.

Although, Dust Man is quoted as saying, “Don’t let me suck more than I can handle!”

So you know what, actually, I take this back.

He’s more important than Chill Man.

We’ve already done the worthwhile ones.

We’ve talked about the construction ones.

We’ve talked about the ones that are “eh whaat uh sure w-okay thas fine.”

We have all of the ones that are alien.

And we’ve got the ones that really didn’t need to be sentient.

We are left with the dregs of robotic society.

I call this category…

NO.

We’ll start with Crystal Man.

He was built to make crystals so that Dr. Wily could sell them for money.

Turbo Man is a car.

Or rather, he used to be a car, but then he was turned into turbo man.

Charge Man.

Is he a train?

No.

But he’s meant to camouflage as one.

I think Dr. Wily’s just real into trains.

You know what I think about when I think of “Safety Operations Manager?”

A big man full of magma.

Built to make sure a plant kept safe, but also had a bunch of cauldrons full of boiling

magma in him.

Time Man.

He’s a time machine.

That never goes well.

Acid Man was built to be a chemist.

What’s he good for, titrations?

That's a chemistry joke.

Centaur Man.

He... was a tour guide.

Just hire a 16 year old.

Like, they need the job.

Shark Man DOS.

Shark Man DOS not need to exist.

Oh we’ve been doing this for like five hours.

*CLAP CLAP*

Goddamnit.

Magic Man was built to be a magician in like a traveling circus sort of show.

And then he was not turned evil, he just decided to conscript in King’s army because he wanted

to show off.

Here’s the big rule of thumb:

magicians are always evil.

Shade Man.

He looks like a vampire, doesn’t he?

It’s ‘cause he was built to look like one.

He was an animatronic robot in a haunted house.

Somebody thought we should make that creepy animatronic robot sentient.

PHEW remember how Centaur Man was a tour guide?

Well so was Dynamo Man.

But they also made him constantly shoot off electricity.

That’s a bad tour guide.

When they got into, like, the late game stages, they were just like, “I dunno, he’s a

tour guide for a thing.”

Torch Man was built to teach kids about fire safety in the woods.

Which is kind of like if Smokey the Bear

was CONSTANTLY ON FIRE.

You thought torch man was bad, let me tell ya about Burner Man, who was made, and I quote,

“to bring harm to natural environments.”

Technically not murder.

Definitely bad.

Remember how I said that a lot of these guys were tour guides?

Well let me tell you about Blade Man.

Built to show off an old castle full of swords.

And also was a sword.

Tengu Man.

Makes typhoons.

HOOOKAY.

We’re at the final three here.

We’ve made it.

And I’d say that these three really hammer home the point

that we should not be making sentient robots.

We’ve got Pirate Man.

Not a murder robot.

But was built to do pirate things, like steal from other ships.

He does look cool as hell, though.

The second to last robot is not actually a terrible robot idea.

But it is a testament to just how trash human beings are.

Bounce Man was built to be a crash test dummy.

Some asshole thought, “Hey, you know that thing we throw against a wall,

many miles-per-hour,

every single day,

multiple times a day?

You know what would make that better?

IF IT COULD FEEL PAIN.”

WHAT?

Luckily, Bounce Man bounced from that job and then became an exercise instructor.

Humans are trash.

Finally, we’ve come to number one.

Clown Man.

Who has ever watched a clown and thought to themselves,

“Boy,

I wish that thing never got tired!"

Clown Man is terrible, and I’m not saying that clowns are terrible.

Okay?

Clowns serve their purpose.

They’re creepy.

Sometimes good.

And…

You know what, I do take that back, clowns don’t serve a purpose.

That’s it.

All 200+ Mega Man robot masters, of which 15 are kind of okay.

Elon Musk: don’t get any ideas.

This is what man has wrought.

You will see these men in your nightmares.

Particularly,

Spring Man.

Jumping around.

 2020-06-25 16:20:08,561 - DEBUG - file running:  Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.

A game that takes heroic and villainous characters and forces them to form fraternal bonds in

the crucible of battle.

Because for those who can superbly smash, there is no better place to make a friend

than on the battlefield.

That’s the battlefield?

Seriously?

How did they get permits for that?

That’s irresponsible.

Hi, I’m Brian David Gilbert, safety fan and bureaucratic wunderkind, please address

me as such, and I’ve spent the last week and a half poring over the regulations of

the United States Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration,

also known as OSHA.

I’m here to hold Super Smash Bros. to account.

Because when you take 70-plus beloved characters and force them to fight for our entertainment,

the least you can do is make sure the buildings are up to code.

So let's go ahead and FIND EVERY OSHA VIOLATION IN EVERY STAGE IN SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE.

First, let’s explain the process, we have to start by choosing the correct regulations,

and unfortunately, there isn’t a OSHA guide to “bloodsport,” so we're just gonna go

with construction, form 1926. 'Cause that's close enough.

The main thing to point out here is 1926.10 subsection A. I’ll read an excerpt for you

so you can understand the basic concept of this video, and also the hellscape I had to slog through

the past week: “no contractor or subcontractor contracting for any part of the contract work”

— that’s a real line — “shall require any laborer or mechanic employed in the performance

of the contract to work in surroundings or under working conditions which are unsanitary,

hazardous, or dangerous.”

Basically, we’re here to build a safer experience for these characters, because when you walk

into an unknown space, I want the first question on your mind to be:

There are roughly 350 regulations in form 1926.

How many pages is that?

About 684.

Don’t worry, this is... this is just a visual aid.

They're all blank.

I wouldn't waste paper like that.

*thinks of the times he's wasted paper*

Most of these regulations are irrelevant, but I

still had to read all 684 pages in order to know which ones to cut.

Which reminds me, this video idea came from commenter nshady16, so if you have an Unraveled

idea, why don't you go ahead and leave me a comment.

And thanks, nshady16, for making me read 684 pages of OSHA regulations,

you piece of garbage.

So I cut out all of the regulations that were just definitions, unrelated to stages, nonmandatory,

redundant, or about personnel safety, because again, we’re not talking about hard hats,

we're talking about the stages themselves.

Unfortunately, this also meant I had to cut out the entirety of subsection R.

Steel Erection.

So there goes like 80% of the jokes in this video.

Out of those 350 regulations, we’re left with 46 that actually relate to Smash Bros. stages.

And again, we're just using the 103 stages you get when you boot up Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.

Any any secret stages that pop up later, uh, that's probably just an underground fighting

ring, which is a different form of illegality.

I’m gonna explain all of these OSHA violations as we go along.

But I just want you to keep in mind that there is a maximum penalty of $12,934 per OSHA violation.

We’ll get into that later.

Let's get these OSHA violations on the board.

BAM!

That's all the OSHA regulations we'll be discussing today.

Let's start with the codes that pretty much every stage violates.

General safety and health provisions.

I threw these three here because they're just dangerous in general and they don't have that

many other specific violations.

Safety training and education.

Seems like most of these people don't have safety training.

Especially in Moray Towers, where they literally shoot guns at you as you fly into the stage.

Recording and reporting of injuries.

Wii Fit Studio is a gym, and so I would expect it to have paperwork if one of the gym members

gets injured.

Unfortunately, all of the gym members get injured.

Means of egress.

In most places, you have to have exit signs.

And also, you have to have exits that don't involve plummeting to your death.

Employee emergency action plans.

It's very important to have an emergency action plan.

Especially if that emergency action plan is for if a mountaintop breaks off and slides

into the ocean.

Look at this polar bear!

He has no fuckin' clue what's going on!

Accident prevention, signs, and tags.

Just put one wet floor sign anywhere, and I'll let it slide, okay?

Duty to have fall protection.

I mean uh... there's no fall protection.

How hard is it to put a harness on someone?

General requirements for stairways and ladders.

Anything above 19 inches of elevation needs a staircase or a ladder.

Not everyone can double jump.

Sanitation.

Most of sanitation deals with potable versus non-potable water.

But a lot of it also deals with toilets, and I have yet to find a Smash Bros. stage that

includes a restroom.

And I need to know where Donkey Kong pees.

So those ones pretty much everyone gets wrong.

Which means that we're at about 900 violations already.

Yikes!

I feel a bit bad hitting all of these stages so hard, so I'll be a bit lenient for 1926.50.

Medical services and first aid.

You have to provide first aid if someone has been hurt.

And I'll just let the max tomato fulfill that requirement.

451 states that you can't be using unstable objects as scaff.

I'm gonna call all of these scaff 'cause there's no OSHA guideline for levitating floors.

Jumping on an awning causes it to break in Onett.

That's totally irresponsible.

452 states that you need to have cross bracing.

Kongo Falls has so many things that aren't cross braced.

453 is all about aerial lifts.

You need to stand firmly on the ground while it is moving.

Stop jumping!

Housekeeping.

You gotta clean out the debris.

I don't care that you've got a big dog running around behind you... put the... put the blocks

away, that's debris!

Put your toys away, honey!

Occupational noise exposure.

I'm ignoring the fact that they're fighting on top of a jet and instead thinking about

how loud those jets are.

Pop some earplugs in!

Gases, vapors, fumes, dusts, and mists.

All of these stages have clouds that you can stand on.

Which means they're incredibly dense.

I don't care what it's made of, you shouldn't be breathing that in.

Illumination.

Those torches don't do anything.

I'm gonna trip and stub my toe.

Ventilation.

A lot of these stages need more airflow, better ventilation, but in Pictochat 2, there is

too much ventilation in the form of this man who blows air.

Who hired this man?

I don't want him on my job site.

Hazardous waste operations and emergency response.

In Flat Zone X, someone spills oil and then just leaves it there.

1926.150, 151, 152, and 154 are all about fire protection.

Most of these regulations are pretty self explanatory.

You need to have a fire extinguisher.

It needs to be readily available.

You can't have ignition hazards hanging around.

You can't store more than 25 gallons of a flammable liquid in one place.

By the way, I'm including magma as a flammable liquid.

I know they mean petroleum substances, but I think that's just a lack of imagination

on OSHA's part.

But 154 is all about temporary heating devices and how they shouldn't be kept in enclosed spaces.

Kind of like the charmander at the top of Saffron City.

The general requirements of electrical equipment.

They should be kept free from hazards that could cause death or harm to employees.

The large airships flying around you in these stages are not only electrical equipment,

but they are designed to harm and kill you.

Violation.

Specific purpose equipment and installations.

This is all about elevators and escalators.

WarioWare Inc. is one big elevator.

You don't need me to tell you it's broken.

Helicopters.

Is a Shy Guy a helicopter?

I think so.

You're not supposed to be working underneath hovering craft.

Even if they're bringing you fruit.

Conveyors.

That includes the stages that move back and forth and also all of the scrolling stages,

which are the fastest way to die in Super Smash Bros. Tools and material shall be secured

to prevent movement.

Don't move equipment unless it's safe.

They're on a live racetrack.

All of the things are moving.

Marine operations and equipment.

You have to have a lifering on a barge, and you have to provide a walkway between wharfs

and boats.

Paper Mario dissolves into a boat, but that doesn't count as a walkway.

And there is not a single lifering at the Donkey Kong residence.

I don't care how good you are at surfing, FUNKY KONG.

Underground construction.

If you're working underground, you're required to have a five-person rescue team on call.

And although Super Smash Bros.

Ultimate does allow up to eight players.

None of them will save you.

Working on or near exposed energized parts.

Does a pokemon count as an energized circuit?

According to OSHA, yes.

1926.1052 is all about stairways.

If you have a stairway that rises more than 40 inches, you need to have a handrail.

I imagine that Mario is about 40 inches tall, and this is at least four or five times his height.

Violation.

Violation.

VIOLATION.

VIOLATION!

Confined spaces.

These are places where you are building where it's hard to get in and out of.

You need to specify the acceptable entry conditions.

There are no acceptable entry conditions into a space with a pit full of acid.

Disposal of waste materials.

If you are dropping waste materials more than 25 feet, you need to be putting it in a chute.

Clock Tower: it is all debris that is falling infinitely.

And it SHOULD be in a chute.

850 is about preparing the demolition building.

You're supposed to remove any glass that could break.

And in Dracula's Castle, Death flies through the window and breaks the glass.

I couldn't give a shit about Death, you should've removed that stained glass first.

853, you can't have a aggregate of more than 25% of a floor destroyed, and in Find Mii,

he destroys half of the stage.

The manual removal of floors.

You can destroy a lot of things in Shadow Moses Island, but you shouldn't be standing

under them.

Tower cranes.

There is only one stage that violates this.

It's literally the only stage with a tower crane, and ya FUCKED IT UP!

Explosives should be stored in a magazine when they're not in use.

And in Wrecking Crew, they're just available for you to punch until they explode.

Firing the blast.

You shouldn't be in the proximity of the blast.

Nor should you be in the barrel that is causing the blast and shooting you off into space.

1926.53 and 54 are about different types of radiation.

Ionizing, which is nuclear, and non-ionizing, which is like lasers.

Final Destination is just flying around through random parts of space.

There is no protection.

You should be less worried about getting punched into oblivion and more worried about the cancers.

In Gamer, your mom fires lasers at you when she sees you gaming.

I'm not here to discuss her qualifications, but you are not allowed to fire those lasers

at employees.

JUST LET ME GAME, MOM!

Ladders.

Suzaku Castle?

You thought you could get away with that shitty-ass ladder?

Those ladder rungs need to be uniform.

They need to be evenly spaced.

They need to not be broken.

I know that ladder is there for aesthetic purposes, but THAT IS A VIOLATION, SUZAKU

CASTLE.

YOU CANNOT HIDE YOUR LADDERS FROM ME.

That leaves us with one stage.

The one that has violated the most regulations.

But I want to point out Boxing Ring.

The only stage that is OSHA compliant.

It's almost as if it was built to allow people to fight in it safely.

Sakurai, I know you worked so hard on this game, and I appreciate it so much, but you

could have stopped at just one stage.

You SHOULD have STOPPED at JUST ONE STAGE.

Finally, weighing in at 23 OSHA violations, it's 75m.

I'm not 100% sure if this had so many violations just because it is a construction site, so

it was easier for me to find all of the flaws with it.

Obviously, Brinstar is probably more dangerous, but I don't know how to categorize Mother Brain.

The thing that pushed it over the edge was material hoists, personnel hoists, and elevators.

They need to be enclosed at all times.

People can just jump on and off of these material hoists over there.

That's so irresponsible.

There's fire.

There are jacks that get thrown across the stage.

There is a large ape.

Again, I could not categorize that, but I know he shouldn't of been there! 75m is the

most OSHA violating stage in Smash Bros.

And if you have to get rid of one of them, that's the one you should get rid of first,

and then you should get rid of the rest of them, too.

Because, again, OSHA does not stop after one stage.

Let's remember back to the beginning of this video when I talked about violation penalties.

I mentioned that every serious violation of OSHA is $12,934 in fines.

I forgot to mention that every repeated or willful violation is $129,336 per violation.

I am going to pretend that I found all of these violations on the same day, and that

they didn't have a chance to fix them all, so therefore they are not repeated.

But that's still 1,317 violations.

Or $17,034,078 in fines.

Which is why I am sending you this video, Masahiro Sakurai.

Surely you can't afford 17 million dollars in fines.

I'm willing to let bygones be bygones.

OSHA doesn't need to hear about all of this evidence I've compiled.

All you must do is send me 50 US dollars.

I'm in a real tough situation right now and I just need to get through the month.

Please.

Also you could send me Kirby's phone number.

I know he is real.

Where are you hiding him?

And I have yet to see a Super Smash Bros. stage that includes a toilet.

And I need to see where Donkey Kong pees.

*Pat & Brian laughing* And I need to know where Donkey Kong Pees.

Oh god I was so close!

And I need to know where Donkey Kong peeHHSHSS.

*through laughter* sorry this is... *breathe in* AHHHH 
 2020-06-25 16:20:08,561 - DEBUG - file running:  *cheerful music, slowly diminishing*

Is life quantifiable?

Every breath, every beat of a heart...

Do they count as tallies etched tirelessly into the stone of our existence,

until one day, that stone is returned to dust?

Is there a number, an algorithm, underlying the spark of life?

And if given the chance to know the arcane secrets of that algorithm,

would you use that power for good?

Or would you use it to calculate your pet’s HP?

Because that’s what I would do!

*energetic music*

HIT POINTS!

What are they and how did they become the standard unit of life in nearly every game?

It all started with war games, tabletop games that involve a lot of little miniature military

forces fighting on a battlefield.

Back in the 1920s, the Naval War College created an early form of this in order to help evaluate

battles before actually fighting them.

They had a stat called “Life” which was determined by how many

14-inch shell hits a vessel could take.

So that’s what a hit point is, how many 14-inch shells it would take to kill you.

Every living creature is one hit point.

The end.

But that isn’t our current understanding of HP.

That came when war games shrank in scope and started to become more fantasy oriented.

In older games, you would roll dice, and then your troops would either survive or they would die.

You had large swaths of nameless troops so you could do this without feeling any remorse

over their deaths.

Haha.

War.

But when these games stopped playing with hundreds of troops and instead focused on

a few main characters, players realized they didn’t want their characters to die!

So the hit point was born.

Your character could survive X number of bad rolls before throwing them in the garbage.

So really, the hit point wasn’t made to quantify how easy something is to kill,

it was born from compassion and wanting to see your characters grow and thrive.

And then also to figure out how easy they were to kill.

We’ve had some semblance of HP for nearly a century, but we haven’t updated our real-world

understanding of what one hit point looks like.

So I’ll be doing that, specifically so you can quantify your pet’s HP.

A little disclaimer up front:

I am not giving you this algorithm so you can battle your pets.

Animal abuse is wrong.

And if you needed me to tell you that...

I’m glad I told you that.

I'm also not teaching you how to calculate human HP, because that power is too great to wield,

and it could easily be used for evil by some of the most wicked forces on Earth...

like health insurance companies.

No, I am teaching you how to calculate your pet’s HP as a fun bonding exercise between

you and your animal, or in case you happen to be at a house party where you don’t know

anyone but the hosts have a dog and so instead of just sitting in the corner pretending to

text people, you can spend your time calculating that dog's HP, which is a way more normal

thing to do in a social situation.

Now it is time for the research.

How are we going to effectively calculate ANY pet’s HP?

Luckily, there are plenty of games that cover pretty much every type of pet that you could

possibly have, but I’ll be using Pokemon as the main pet HP analog because it is literally

about having lots and lots of pets that you can love and cherish

and I’m ignoring all the other stuff.

And that brings us to our first criteria: Type.

According to the National Pet Owners Survey, here are the most common types of pets found

in U.S. Households.

I appreciate that they have included a category called “Small Animals,”

as if that means fucking anything.

So we're changing some things.

The standards are still there: Dog, Cat, Fish (and all aquatic creatures), Reptile, Bird,

Equine, Small animal is becoming small mammal for things like ferrets and rabbits.

We're also including bug, because I love bugs!

And if you have bugs in your house and you make the conscious decision to WANT those bugs in your house,

they aren't pests,

they're pets...s.

Amphibian for the frog people.

Farm animals covers any livestock that don’t immediately fit into the other categories.

Originally, I thought about classifying these quadrupedal animals as different sorts of dog.

Chunky dog, milky dog, horny dog.

But farm animal encompasses them a little bit better.

I am still keeping those names, though.

We also have a category I call “exotic,” which encompasses all of the animals you see

in instagram influencer pics that make you say,

This can go from monkeys to bats to hyenas, which, according to this incredibly reliable

website, I could technically own in New York due to a loophole?

*about to make a terrible decision*

Also, Millennials and Gen Z often live in tiny, “no pet” apartments and

don’t get paid enough to support a decent standard of living for themselves, let alone

a pet, so they’ll often turn to plants in order to feel the joy that comes from nurturing

a living thing in our rapidly decaying ecosystem.

*sigh*

So I’m extending pet status to plants so that way you too can do this HP calculation,

because, god, we all need a distraction sometimes.

By building a set of pet types, we are able to assign HP RANGES to each of them by finding

the lowest base HP and highest max HP of each type.

The absolute extremes of this scale are Shedinja, with a base HP of 1, and Wailord, with a max HP of 544.

Now, both of these would be pretty wild to have as pets,

considering one is the shell left behind after a cicada molts,

and the other is a fucking whale.

But that’s why they’re the extremes, and that’s why we are not done with our equation yet.

We might know the full HP range of a dog, but what is the HP range of YOUR dog.

I thought for a moment about having size be the next criteria, because you might think

that the larger the animal, the more HP it would have.

But that’s actually not true!

In fact, the Pokemon with the highest base HP is Blissey, this strange little egg woman.

And Onix, an enormous rock snake, has one of the lowest base HPs of all Pokemon.

This confused me, so I had to go back to the original popularizer of HP: Dungeons & Dragons.

And it was there that I realized what truly affects your HP value:

Your value is not defined by the size or shape of your body,

it’s about what you do with the body you’re given.

*cheesy motivational music*

It’s all about class!

As in, what standard gaming class does your pet fall into?

Every class has different HP ranges based on what they are expected to do.

Barbarians are out in the front lines, so they tend to have a lot more HP than a rogue,

who is slinking around in the back.

I’ve decided that the classes that make the most sense for pets are: Barbarian, Ranger,

Paladin, Cleric, and Rogue.

I haven’t included any classes like sorcerer, because if you have a magical pet,

what are you doing here?

Go cast spells with your turtle.

These class distinctions separate your pet’s HP range into 10 equal portions.

If your pet is a rogue, you get the first six.

If your pet is a barbarian, you're anywhere from five to 10.

Your pet’s personality will determine what class they fall into.

Your pet is a rogue if they are rakish, mischievous, and spry.

Cats tend to come to mind for the rogue category, simply because they’re always up in shit

they should not be up in.

Your pet is a cleric if they are kind, reserved, and healing.

A rabbit that hops onto your lap after a rough day of work and makes you forget all your

worries is 100% cleric.

Your pet is a paladin if it is loyal, resourceful, and, honestly, tries a little bit too hard.

Does your zucchini plant produce too many zucchinis?

A.K.A.

Any amount of zucchinis?

It's a paladin.

Your pet is a ranger if they are self-sufficient, aloof, and kind of do their own thing.

Ask yourself, am I holding my pet rat back from their true ambitions?

The answer is always yes, and your rat is a ranger.

And finally your pet is a barbarian if they are boorish, brazen, and courageous to a fault.

Does your dog dig under the fence so it can jump into your neighbor’s pool?

Your dog is Marmaduke.

It is also a Barbarian.

Your pet can have a combination of many of these traits, but it’s up to you to decide

which traits are most dominant.

Now that we have your pet’s type and class designated, we need to get into the nitty

gritty of their exact HP, which means finding your pet's level.

In order to do this, you must observe your pet in a scientific manner.

So I reached out to field biologist.

Hi, I’m Olivia.

I'm a wildlife biologist.

I contacted Olivia after she responded to my totally normal twitter request with this

dope-ass picture.

I figured that if anyone knew how to calculate the hit points of an animal, it would be someone

holding a huge bird like it was a torch.

Have you ever found the hit points of any of the animals you've been researching?

I've never been involved in any sort of study where that was something that we looked at.

So no.

Okay.

But there are probably plenty of studies about hit points with animals.

Probably.

Though she didn’t have experience with my specific question, I knew she would have some

useful advice for observing animals in their natural habitat.

When you're observing an animal, how much interaction should you have with it?

None.

None.

At all.

None.

You have to sit in like a blind or a tent of some sort where you're hidden or you look

like part of the environment.

You could wear a ghillie suit.

Brian - Oh!

Olivia - People have also done that.

How long of a period are you observing that animal for?

It depends on how much time and resources you have, obviously.

There have been scientists that have been observing the same hawk for, like, 20 years in a row.

So if I'm trying to... perfectly know my pet's HP, I should be observing it for

multiple years.

Yes.

Cool.

How do you take notes when you're observing an animal.

Right, so, I actually—can I send you something?

Yes, please.

This is exactly what I was looking for.

Olivia had sent me an animal behavior data sheet, which I could use as a template for

observing and recording a pet’s behavior.

But some of these behaviors wouldn’t make sense when observing your pet on a random day.

We ended up developing a new sheet that had standard behaviors and class specific behaviors

that had different weights associated with them.

You observe your pet for X number of hours, tally up all the behaviors they did over the

course of those hours, and then divide the weighted total by X to give you your pet’s level.

The logic behind this is that a higher level pet is more likely to do more intense and

class specific behaviors.

Then you plug that level into this algorithm, and you get your pet’s HP.

It may seem challenging, but science shouldn’t be easy, it should be correct.

This is probably the hardest scientific work you've ever had to do.

It really is.

Yeah.

With these tips in mind, I welcome you into my home.

In order to test these calculations, I need a test subject.

So I’m using my roommate’s cat, Zuko!

He lives in my apartment but he doesn’t pay rent and he eats my bagels if I leave

them unattended.

As I mentioned previously, finding your pet's HP can be a fun bonding exercise, and in this

case, I’ve been dealing with this small bastard’s antics for so long, I need to

remind myself why he’s here by quantifying his value.

The first step is easy!

He is a cat.

That puts him in the cat category.

Okay.

Step two, we gotta give Zuko a class.

As I mentioned previously, cats are often rogues, but I don't think that fits Zuko considering

he’s the least stealthy creature I know.

His meow sounds like he’s been smoking two packs a day for the past forty years.

*incredibly raspy meow*

And every time he does manage to sneak into his food cabinet,

he lets me know immediately.

Just wanted to check in on what's going on up here in the cat cabinet where we keep all

of the food for the cat.

*loud crash*

He is loud, stubborn, and not afraid to make terrible decisions in plain

view of me.

And that makes this guy a Barbarian.

Okay!

But now it is time to observe Zuko to find his level.

As per Olivia’s instructions, I must observe him for several years without any interaction.

After explaining why I needed it, my time off request was denied.

So instead, I ate some bodega sushi in order to induce illness, and I took a sick day.

Mmmm.

This is the hard part, because it's going to require me to observe Zuko as he goes about

his daily business without him noticing that I am here at all.

I assumed my position, and I waited for the interesting behaviors to start.

*cheeky music plays*

Not only was this terribly boring, but I was beginning to fear that Zuko

was not as strong as I had hoped.

DO SOMETHING!

PLEASE!

But then I realized there was a exploit in my system.

Though Olivia, a scientist, said that you should keep your interferences to a minimum...

I’m not a scientist, I’m a gamer.

And I began what is known as power leveling.

I had to get Zuko as many experience points as I could before my roommate got home and

asked me what I was doing.

Over the course of the day, Zuko averaged 63 behavioral experience points per hour,

although those behaviors were somewhat coerced by me.

I know that I broke my system by interacting with Zuko, but if it makes my pet happier

and it makes him less of a weak-ass scrub, why wouldn’t I game the system!

I had also noticed that Zuko and I had grown closer, our support level had increased to

at least a B. I no longer saw him as a freeloader who sometimes throws up in my bed,

I saw him as a companion...

who sometimes throws up in my bed.

When I felt lonely in my empty apartment, he was there for me.

When my stomach ached from the bodega sushi, he purred at just the right frequency to ease my pain.

When I was worried he was going to be under leveled, he soothed my anxieties

with his heavenly voice.

*beautiful meow*

And all this time I had spent trying to calculate his HP,

I hadn't realized he was replenishing mine.

So here is Zuko, Barbarian class level 63.

I love him with all my heart, and he loves me just the same.

Ow!

Okay, okay...

*lots of wonderful meows*

Beautiful.

Psst!

Remember when I said I really wanted to play the Cyberpunk RPG?

We finally did it.

Come watch me play as a totally uncool forum moderator called Vang0Bang0.

Guys don't say other things, we should only have one person in the...

You're making it sound like there are more than one person in...

There's only one person in the bathroom! 
 2020-06-25 16:20:08,562 - DEBUG - file running:  *drum beat*

THE SIMS! While other games push you through the meticulously crafted story

of some hero, this game allows you to experience the joy that comes from crafting your friends and family

and then making them pee themselves in doorless rooms.

I’ve been playing The Sims since I was a kid, and it allowed me to imagine what I might become.

A successful doctor, perhaps, with a mansion

and a pool that doesn’t have a ladder to get out of it.

And now that I’m a D-list internet video producer with a grungy apartment in New York City,

I’ve realized that I was using The Sims as wish fulfillment.

Perhaps there’s a better way.

I might only have one life, but my Sim can live many, many lives.

I was playing a game.

I should have been doing an experiment.

So today, I’m going to use The Sims to perfect my living situation.

*music stops*

Oh what a surprise!

Now, this Unraveled will be a little bit different

considering most of it is going to be game footage, meaning...

I don’t need any paper!

Let me explain my methodology. We will have two subjects:

Simulated Brian, and reality Brian, which is me, I’m Reality Brian.

Here’s my hypothesis: If Simulated Brian’s living situation can be perfected in the Sims,

then Reality Brian’s living situation can also be perfected by altering it the same way in real life.

Now, I could try to do this in a “perfectly controlled environment,” but life is messy and sometimes

science has to be messy, too. So before I can create my Sim...

I gotta measure my apartment.

Obviously, I have to work with what I currently have. And if I’m supposed to make an honest

simulacrum of my living situation I gotta make sure it’s to scale.

I should also point out that I live in a three bedroom apartment with two roommates and a cat. And although

they have rooms of their own, I will not be modeling them in the Sims.

Partially because I rarely spend any time in their rooms, but it’s more because I am a good roommate

who respects personal boundaries. I will not redecorate their personal spaces.

But I will exploit the common space for content.

When you cut my roommates rooms, you can split my apartment into 6 different sections.

I used vanilla Sims 4, because I didn’t want Simulated Brian to accidentally become a wizard, or a skeleton,

or a college student.

The first step is to make an accurate depiction of myself, both in personality and in appearance.

This took a good chunk of time, but it was worth it when I crafted an exact 1 to 1 replica

of myself in the Sims. Then, I built the space. I used my measurements and gave myself close

to unlimited funds to create the apartment, and bought myself the cheapest appliances

just like my landlord did.

At the end of this, I had a pretty exact reproduction.

Then it was test time.

I gave myself a career similar to my own, and then I let Simulated Brian do his thing.

My rule was that I had to have little to no interaction.

But after a few days, it became clear that there were flaws with my experiment.

One, it was too slow.

If I want a longitudinal look at Simulated Brian’s living situation, I need to see his ENTIRE life.

Two, this experiment is meant to perfect my living situation, not my job.

And currently, Sim Brian is finding enough fulfillment in his career, which is an uncontrolled space.

Sim Brian needs to stay in his apartment, and that means no job.

Three, Sim Brian was perfectly content reading books,

and everyone knows that books are BORING!

So I obviously need to fix whatever personality flaw turned my Sim into a dweeb.

I addressed the first flaw by downloading a mod that would allow me to put on Ultra Fast Speed.

I also altered my sim's personality to reflect my own… and I accepted that Simulated Brian’s appearance

wasn’t all that accurate in the first trial, so I fixed that as well.

With the new personality traits and the ultra fast speed mod, this trial was far more accurate.

I spent a lot of time standing in my bathroom, staring at the wall, or sadly contemplating my reflection.

And then Sim Brian died of starvation after 4 days.

Which is a MASSIVE SUCCESS!

I got to see the entirety of my Sim's life!

In trial 3, I took a hands-off approach.

I popped on ultra fast speed, and I let it ride.

In this trial, I die of starvation after just 2 and a half days.

Which makes me think that this mod might be so fast that Sim Brian can’t feed himself.

So in trial 4, I start on normal fast speed,

and I decide I’ll only jump to lightspeed when I’m bored.

And things start well enough!

Sim Brian manages to socialize and stay happy for two days.

It starts to break down on Tuesday, when I find my sim

sadly eating a grilled cheese in his empty kitchen.

And then on Wednesday, Sim Brian sadly eats cereal while staring out the kitchen window.

Things get real bad at 2 am on Thursday,

when he stares in the mirror for hours.

The ennui has set in.

That afternoon, he stands in front of some dirty dishes on the coffee table,

too depressed to wash them in the sink, which is mere feet away.

Sim Brian goes through the same motions for the next week.

Watching TV. Staring in the mirror. Sleeping at random intervals. He seems devastatingly unhappy.

But he manages to live a much fuller life than the past two iterations!

It takes him nearly a week longer to die of starvation!

Except, he doesn’t really die.

In an effort to expedite the death sequence, I accidentally hit ultra fast speed,

and for some reason,

this killed death.

I waited, hoping the reaper would respawn, but no.

So I rushed through the days.

Waiting for someone to find my collapsed body in the weird corner of my creepy hallway,

but the only people who noticed my quote unquote "death"

were the utility companies.

I used this moment to look around my neighborhood.

Most houses were far nicer.

I was alone in a little box surrounded by neighbors who had forgotten me, or perhaps never knew I existed.

Even death had forgotten me.

I watched my slumped body linger in limbo as nothing changed.

After a week, I resigned myself to quitting.

And then in trial 5 I peed myself!

A LOT!

Boy, trial 5 exemplifies how much my apartment needs an upgrade.

At the beginning of the trial, my sim left the house to socialize.

And he was so happy not being in his tiny apartment that he stayed outside for 12 hours,

ignoring his bodily functions, and at 9pm, while speaking to a potential new friend,

he peed himself.

Does this make the embarrassed and uncomfortable Sim go inside?

NO.

Sim Brian so loathes his living space that he decides to stand outside all night browsing the internet,

until again, he pees himself right before having a flirty conversation with his friend Terri.

Dirty, dirty Terri.

After another full day outside,

hunger, exhaustion, and the need to pee FINALLY make Sim Brian go home.

He was more willing to spend two nights soaked in piss before spending a single minute inside his apartment.

Big Mood.

The rest of his life was typical. Mirror. Standing. Dying of starvation.

After 5 control trials, it was time for the results.

Here’s what I learned:

One, I’d rather spend time outside my house in repulsive conditions than spend time inside my house.

Something needs to change.

Two, the only thing that ever managed to make Sim Brian happy

was “good decoration.”

I need to redecorate.

And three, Sim Brian managed his basic needs until he became desolate due to a lack of social interaction.

A hole so deep he couldn’t go anywhere but down.

And this makes me believe that the thing that killed me was not starvation,

but rather becoming so lonely that I no longer sought to fix my situation.

But that has nothing to do with my apartment,

so let’s focus on the things we can change!

Simulated Brian was happiest in these terrible trials when the decorations were good,

and that’s something I can fix in real life.

But before I do, let’s set some ground rules:

One, I can't alter any of the rooms in my apartment, or I'd lose my security deposit.

Two, I can't change the furniture, because my roommates bought it, and then they’d hate me.

And three, the money. I had considered giving my sim a budget similar to my own,

but money cannot buy happiness.

And if this is true, then money, when compared to happiness, has no correlation.

Therefore, money is no object, and my sim should be allowed to purchase anything regardless of price.

Infinite money.

Sims decorations show how many environmental points they are worth.

By this logic, it doesn’t matter how well a room is decorated…

it matters how MUCH a room is decorated.

So I spent a solid hour giving my apartment the most decorations possible.

Allow me to give you a first person tour.

The Living Room now has lots of beautiful paintings.

The Weird Nook now has a purpose as The JAZZ Room, because for some reason,

the Sims has SO MANY JAZZ PAINTINGS.

The TV has to stay, but now I have three maps around it to say, “I’m also smart sometimes.”

The Kitchen hasn’t changed because it’s small and there’s no space to hang anything.

The creepiness of the hallway has crystallized into Sad Clowns.

No one wanted to spend much time in this hallway before,

and now they REALLY don’t want to.

In my room, a bunch of portraits, an apple wall, and a pear wall.

This should remind my sim to eat food.

And finally, in the bathroom, I installed a second mirror so I can’t just stare at the wall.

Now let’s see it in action.

In the first trial, I did another hands off approach on ultra fast speed,

and my sim once again died of starvation super quickly.

So, yeah, maybe the mod is too strong.

BUT! In trial 2, things go way better.

For the first time in any of the trials,

my sim manages to go from Very Sad to Happy, thanks to the tasteful decorations!

Though Sim Brian has moments of ennui and loneliness, for the most part, the house is making him happier.

Sim Brian does so well that he survives after the utilities shut off his power and water,

and he dies of starvation after more than two weeks.

That’s nearly DOUBLE the length of any of the other trials!

MY DECORATIONS WORKED!

Yeah, I still die of starvation, but I’m living TWICE AS LONG!

And that’s all the proof I need that this is the perfect form of my apartment.

All I gotta do now is make it in real life.

Polygon said that they wouldn’t reimburse me for purchasing thousands of dollars worth of paintings,

even though I TOLD them it would make me more productive,

so I gave myself a budget.

Then I went to a lot of thrift stores to purchase

as many paintings as I could find.

Some fit the aesthetic. Others would need alterations.

But I got a lot of things! Or, I thought I had, until I got home and realized

it wasn’t even going to cover one of my walls, let alone all six rooms.

So I dug around my apartment to find anything that could be stuck on the walls.

In the end, I was able to fill the entrance, but the rest of the living room was pretty sparse.

In the Jazz room I put up a papier mache man playing the piano, a dart board that felt pretty jazz to me,

and a skeleton wearing a tank top that says "I heart my Daddy,"

because...

I honestly didn’t know where else I could put that.

In my own room, I put up the appletini painting and

hung a huge self portrait from my senior year of high school.

And that was it.

That’s all I had in terms of decorations.

I took the day off to do this, but I was done in an hour.

I even put on my suit in order to film the results of the trial,

but my house felt as empty as it had when I began.

I couldn’t start the live experiment because I couldn’t recreate my sim’s house.

But I wasn’t giving up.

If I couldn’t purchase the decorations I needed, I figured I could make them myself.

So I bought a bunch of washable paint and 1000 feet of butcher paper.

“I don't need any paper!”

I lied.

It was a week before Thanksgiving. I was going to be out of town

and I needed to finish this part of the video before I left.

That meant I had to create about 70 large paintings in less than three days.

I got a solid start, painting all of the apples and pears.

I even managed to edit the two paintings I got from the thrift store into Sad Clowns.

But I was halfway through the second Sad Clown when this process started weighing on me.

If I had to spend a few hours on 10 of the simplest paintings,

there was no way I was gonna get this finished before deadline.

I was alone in an apartment making shitty paintings for a video that wasn’t gonna get made in time.

I got a stress migraine, so I turned off the camera, and I went to lie down.

When I woke up from that heinous nap,

I decided to do one of the most difficult things I’ve had to do for an Unraveled:

I asked for help.

And if you’ve never had to ask your friends and coworkers

to help you paint terrible paintings for a stupid video,

let me say you’re not missing out on much.

It’s an uncomfortable thing to ask people to do.

And honestly, the weirdest part of this whole process is that...

people said yes.

People said they'd come help me paint.

And, and they said yes just because they wanted to,

and also 'cause I said I’d buy pizza,

but you gotta grease the wheels somehow.

So I turned my house into a painting factory. I cut the paper. I moved the furniture.

And that night, people came over. Not just my roommate and my coworkers but my friends,

and friends of those friends.

I was expecting one or two people to help me, but I ended up with 10 people in my house,

all painting large scale portraits

and REALLY GOOD SAD CLOWNS.

Seriously, who knew that my friends were SO GOOD at painting sad clowns?

I don’t 100% know how to feel about how good my friends are at painting sad clowns,

but I'm glad I gave 'em an outlet.

All of these people came over just to make my apartment happier.

To lend a hand when I was overwhelmed.

And not only were they helping me make my apartment happier by decorating it,

they made it happier just by being there.

This task that had given me a stress migraine became a really fun time.

And it reminded me that, although it can sometimes feel uncomfortable or embarrassing,

if you ask for help, more often than not,

people are willing to help

you paint large pictures of jazz men.

In three hours, a task that seemed insurmountable by myself was complete.

And I was so excited that I did the walkthrough while they were all still there.

The Living room with fabulous landscapes,

The Jazz room’s huge murals.

The Creepy clown hallway that was way too good.

My room with its amazing portraits and fruit walls.

And the bathroom, where I stared at myself,

not considering my flaws or my apartment, but just smiling.

That’s it.

Just smiling.

It’s been well over two weeks since my apartment was redecorated,

which is longer than I survived in the Sims trials,

so it’s been an incredible success.

My apartment is perfected, I’m happier with it, and it’s all thanks to the redecoration.

Or at least, that’s part of it.

I think that part of the reason I find so much joy in my apartment is knowing

that the decorations were made by people I care about.

There’s a story behind it.

Simulated Brian fell further into sadness due to his isolation,

but the paint night turned Reality Brian’s terrible situation into something joyous.

So I have to wonder:

Does my newly perfected apartment make me happier because of the decorations,

or because of the people who helped me decorate it?

Trick question, it’s obviously the decorations.

JESUS! 
 2020-06-25 16:20:08,562 - DEBUG - file running:  Ah, the Elder Scrolls, games chock-full of lore.

And Skyrim is no different.

Hidden amongst the draugr and dragons is a plethora of books full of very important

and incredibly niche details.

But with all the spellcasting and shouting you must do as dragonborn, who really has

the time to read all those books.

I DO.

APPARENTLY.

I read every book in Skyrim in order to answer the eternal question, “Should you read every

book in Skyrim?”

And I’m here to give you my top five recommendations of books, here in my SKYRIM BOOK REPORT.

Skyrim book report!

How many books are there, really, in Skyrim?

After all, there are only eight people credited as writers on Skyrim.

Those eight people are responsible for every quest, every voice acting line, every response

you can give to an NPC.

How much time do they have to write all those other books?

A lot!

Because they wrote this many books.

This many books.

*pained grin*

Or at least they wrote most of them because a few of them have been grandfathered in from

other Elder Scrolls games.

Before I get into the nitty gritty, let me explain my process on how I did this Skyrim

Book Report.

I printed out every book in Skryim, and then I spent multiple eight-hour days reading EVERY.

SINGLE.

BOOK.

I whittled it down to 338 books because I didn’t include journals or diaries.

Everyone knows that self-published doesn’t count.

In total, that’s 571 pages, five and a half point font, over three hundred and sixteen

THOUSAND words.

I had two reactions to this.

My first reaction was, “Wow.”

This is an incredible amount of world building.

To write 300,000 words that could essentially be skipped over while still having the full

Skyrim experience, it’s amazing, and it’s a level of world building that could only

exist in an interactive medium.

And for that, I commend you, Bethesda.

My second reaction to this,

was WHAT THE FUCK.

HEY TODD?

WHAT THE FU-

In my Skyrim Book Report, I will be discussing:

*smack*

That’s a smash cut.

Hopefully.

If I do my editing correctly.

338 books.

Uh, actually, 337, I just realized, um, over here, Songs of Skyrim, I put both of them

in there, but there’s a revised edition.

I lied.

It’s just 337 books now.

Obviously, I don’t have time to synopsize all of these, and believe me, you wouldn’t

want to watch that even if I could.

I’ve split them into categories to make this a little bit easier.

First up, historical books!

These book titles you see rolling up the screen are all biographies or histories.

What I categorized as histories was anything that had big historical dates in them, explanatory

histories, or pretty much anything that was boring.

History’s so BORING.

UGHHHH.

J.R.R. Tolkien

*kiss*

did the world a disservice by making every single fantasy writer think

that they need to chronicle every goddamn minute of their world in order for it to be

legitimate.

I don’t give two shits about a king who lost a war 700 years ago.

*snoring noises* Get OUTTA here!

Some of these biographies are actually pretty interesting.

But a lot of them are written like The Chronicles of Nchuleft.

I didn’t tab it out ‘cause it’s a shitty story.

“It happened in Second Planting (P.D. 1220) that Lord Ihlendam, on a journey in the Western

Uplands, came to Nchuleft; and Protector Anchard and General Rkungthunch met him there, and

Dalen-Zanchu also came to the meeting.

They talked together long by themselves; but this only was known of their business, that

they were to be friends of each other.

They parted, and each went home to his own colony.”

RIVETING.

Ugh.

History’s so boring.

I’m done with this.

Next category: Instructional books!

These are all field guides or basic recipes about how to make good armor or what flowers

go in which potions.

At best, they are in-fiction instructional books.

At worst, they are so obviously trying to get you to go do specific things.

Pulls you right out of the fiction!

C’mon man.

That’s all I’m gonna say about that.

Everyone’s favorite: the academic books.

Fun fact about academic books that I learned in college

is that no one has ever enjoyed writing or reading an academic paper.

WHY’D YOU PUT IT IN A VIDEO GAME.

Mythicaaaaal stories.

It’s kind of weird to differentiate things between myth and history, especially in this

world where you can talk to demon princes.

I split these two up because these are very boring and these are slightly more palatable.

They’re more like creation myths, or they’re just like random stories that are fun to read,

so they’re getting closer to good fiction.

The poetic and dramatic.

Everyone knows that poetry and theatre are meant to be seen and not read.

And you have NO IDEA how much it pains me that I do not have time to do staged readings

of all these.

Oh my GOD I would have loved that.

We have “eh.”

What genre is “eh?”

It’s the catchall.

Um, these tend to be accounts, kind of like medieval fantasy op-eds.

So I…

I just put ‘em here.

EH!

We’re done with these now, so…

Get outta here!

Finally, we have 59 books that I would consider good fiction.

GooooOOOD fiction.

What I did here is I gave myself three criteria about what would make good fiction in the

realm of Skyrim.

Number one, does it help build the world around us?

Number two, does it give us an interesting or different perspective on that world?

And number three, is it good?

Now you might say, “Brian, what gives you the right to say what is good fiction?”

I READ ALL 338 YA DINGUS.

BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY THAT THESE WERE THE ONLY GOOD ONES.

THIS IS ALL I’M QUALIFIED TO DO NOW.

I need a drink.

*deep breath*

Okay!

There’s still 59 of these, so I obviously can’t summarize all of them, but I have

left five off, and they are my top five books of Skyrim.

So we’re gonna talk about those.

Number five, Advances in Lockpicking.

Now Advances in Lockpicking is actually an instructional book.

But I think it does more than just the other instructional books, where you open them up

and suddenly you’re better at lockpicking, because it’s written by a thief in a very

interesting voice.

There’s a great ending line for this book: “Some thieves can’t read.

If you can’t read, get someone to read this book to you.

It will make more sense then.”

That’s great.

I think that’s a much more fun way than saying, “Here is how you pick a lock.

This is what this set of armor is.”

Better than instructional.

Just good fiction.

Number four, Palla.

In a world where crazy creatures exist, how do you make fiction that is compelling that

people can just kind of experience in their own life.

Palla is a necromantic romantic book.

It’s a story about a man who sees this beautiful statue of a woman fighting a beast and falls

instantly in love with this woman.

Turns out, she’s dead!

From fighting that beast.

He decides to get into necromancy to bring her back from the dead.

I kind of don’t want to ruin the surprise for you.

It manages to tell an interesting story while also introducing these ideas of monsters and

necromancy.

It’s kind of weird, but it’s very well written.

I’m gonna go ahead and put up three and two.

Why do I put up the Argonian Account and Feyfolken at the same time?

Turns out, it’s written by the same fictional author: WAUGHIN JARTH.

This one’s for you, Waughin!

I’m a big Jarth head!

He’s not actually in the story at all, I couldn’t find any instance of, like, him

as an NPC.

So I really hope he’s in the next one.

Because I want to meet Waughin.

I just want to meet Waughin Jarth.

These ones were not actually written specifically for Skyrim.

They were grandfathered in.

But they do an incredible job of building the world around you.

The Argonian Account is actually the second story in a series all about Decumus Scotti.

This is kind of like the Hobbit of Tamriel, where we’re taking this unassuming character

and thrusting them into this completely foreign, amazing landscape, except instead of a hobbit,

it is a midlevel bureaucrat.

It’s full of screwball comedy and wonderful worldbuilding about the Black Marsh which

is where all the Argonians live.

You have to fast travel by being eaten alive by a worm.

That’s great.

I want to see that whenever we go to the Black Marsh.

It’s so flavorful, and that’s why I’m a Jarth head.

Feyfolken.

It’s a story about a scribe who’s terrible at his job but gets this enchanted quill that

forces him to be amazing.

Sends himself into this madness, and he kills himself at the end of the book, spoiler alert.

But that’s not what this story is really about.

It’s an interesting fiction that teaches you about different Daedric princes, and which

ones could have caused this specific enchantment on the quill.

That’s good worldbuilding!

I am interested in the story!

You told me something that I can learn about the world.

I had a good time reading Feyfolken!

Jarth, ya did it again!

And that leaves us with the number one book.

It’s not The Lusty Argonian Maid.

I feel like I should broach this subject.

I’ll tell you why I didn’t include it in my good fiction list,

and it’s not because I’m a prude, who doesn’t love a little erotic lizard fiction?

*OOH COME ON BABY*

The reason I didn’t include The Lusty Argonian Maid as one of the best

pieces of fiction is because it’s SEVEN ACTS LONG.

Seven acts?

There is no way you can manage to maintain that level of erotic tension for seven acts.

That’s like five and a half hours!

As a person who has done one or two plays in my life, that’s just unfeasible.

Okay?

I’d like to see them try.

~I would like to see them try~

*OOH COME ON BABY*

Before I go to number one, I gotta go

get a flu shot.

This is not a joke.

It’s important to get your flu shot.

Alright, I’m back.

The number one piece of fiction in Skyrim, not Waughin Jarth, I’m sorry.

It’s Beggar, Thief, Warrior, King.

It’s four books, actually.

But it’s all part of Eslaf Erol’s story.

It is completely fiction even within the fiction of Skyrim.

The reason I put it first is because it’s the only book that was legitimately hilarious.

I straight up chortled.

*chortle*

That’s what I did.

In real life.

That’s amazing.

The writing style of these four books is just naturally hilarious.

There are so many bland, cookie-cutter stories in Skyrim that follow the same set up, twist, punchline.

This doesn’t have that.

It’s just a good story.

One of these writers was just flexing, and I think that’s wonderful that a writer had

a chance to—within the fiction of Skyrim—write something that’s just naturally funny.

You should all go home, onto your computers, boot up Skyrim, find these four books, and

then read them, in order.

It’s worth it!

That’s my quest, for you in Skyrim.

300 gold points.

That’s it!

That’s it, that’s all of the books.

So like, what did I learn from reading all 338 books of Skyrim?

Surprisingly, a whole lot.

Like, there are two main takeaways that I pulled from this.

Number one, this is a masterclass on how to write effective flavor text.

Between all of these, historical, instructional, the good fiction, and, you know, the iffy fiction.

This is a way to learn what to do and what not to do.

Obviously, not everyone is going to connect with certain types of flavor text.

I’m sure there’s a lot of people that disagree with me and think that the historical

is the most important flavor text.

And you know what?

They are valid.

And they’re wrong.

And they always seem to find my comment sections.

When you take something good like Feyfolken which teaches you about the Daedric princes,

but in an interesting way, it really shines in comparison to the three and a half million

biographies of Barenziah.

You don’t even see them in Skyrim.

I don’t care about Barenziah.

IT’S BORIIIIIII-

But not like Feyfolken!

That’s really interesting and effective.

Also it just teaches you about all these wonderful forms of fiction.

If you’re a fiction teacher, like, teach your kids with Skyrim!

TEACH THE KIDS.

WITH SKYRIM.

I got a creative writing degree.

That’s all I have to say about that.

Second takeaway, this is a wonderful teaching device about unreliable narrators.

So many of these histories are negating other ones.

This is a wonderful way of showing people you need to read everything if you’re going

to get the whole picture.

I read everything.

I am the keeper of the picture.

That’s every book in Skyrim.

So it’s time for us to revisit that ever present question, “Should you read every

book in Skyrim?”

NO!

WHAT?

HOW COULD YOU WATCH THIS WHOLE 10+ MINUTE VIDEO AND THINK THAT I WOULD SAY ANYTH- WHAT?

NO!

I BORE THIS BURDEN!

FOR YOU!

DON’T READ THEM!

NO!

Please don’t read them all.

DON’T READ THEM!

You can read the top five, that’s fine.

GRRRRR.

HOW DARE YOU JETTISON MY GIFT!

DON’T READ THEM!

screaming

This new Sonic has a lot of fans crying heresy.

Sonic should be that cute, blue, cartoon hedgehog that’s gotta go fast,

and that’s all he’s gotta do.

But what if I told you that this was not the only blasphemous version of Sonic

What if I told you that nearly every single piece of Sonic media was heretical

I hold in my hand 13 pages that prove just that.

Before I hop into the deep end, I need to explain a little about Sega, these 13 pages,

and how Sonic was made.

You see, Sega was in a real tough spot in the early ‘90s as it tried to compete with

Nintendo and the overwhelmingly successful Mario.

So they worked internally to create a new mascot.

Not just for a game, but for the company as a whole.

Naoto Ohshima created Mr. Needlemouse, a teal hedgehog with red sneakers.

And then he worked with Yuji Naka to create a game around this wonderful creature.

A few tweaks and Sonic the Hedgehog was born.

Or at least one version of Sonic was born.

You see, Sega wasn’t just fighting with Nintendo, it was also fighting with itself.

Sega of America and Sega of Japan had a lot of tension between them, and they didn’t

see eye to eye on a lot of things, especially when it came to Sonic.

The original version of Sonic was a bit more punk rock and had a girlfriend.

A real life human girlfriend named Madonna.

And we all know that Sega would never make Sonic kiss a real human woman.

discomfort

So Sega of America started to iron things out a little bit.

Make Sonic a bit more family friendly.

More marketable.

Madeline Schroeder, the self-described mother of Sonic, wrote out this 13-page bible that

set out Sonic's true origins.

These 13 pages went on to become the true Sonic.

The Sonic we all know and love.

Right

NOPE.

THIS BIBLE HAS HAD VERY LITTLE BEARING ON THE SERIES AS A WHOLE.

But here’s the thing, friends.

It should have a lot of bearing on the series as a whole.

And I am willing to wield this bible as a paladin wields a holy sword so that I might

EXCISE SIN OUT FROM THE SONIC CANON.

I'm sorry.

That was a lot.

I was a bit too intense for...

I'm gonna tone it down a little bit.

Folks, we’re about to engage in a friendly session of biblical literalism.

Now, I’m not one to advocate taking a written account as the pure truth and nothing but...

but for Sonic I’m willing to bend my values a little bit.

We're about to take everything written in these 13 pages as gospel, and anything that deviates

from the facts therein as sacrilege.

Let’s get Sonically Fundamental.

I’m not gonna read this bible in its entirety.

You can read it online if you'd like.

But I am going to read the first paragraph in full, because I think it's important for

you to understand what we’re dealing with.

“Sonny Hedgehog was born on Earth in the early 21st century, in the town of Hardly,

Nebraska, population 1,226.”

From the first line alone, we already know that

1. Sonic’s birth name is actually Sonny.

2. He is a real hedgehog that was born circa 2000.

And 3. He’s a midwestern boy.

“He and his mother and five sisters live underneath a scraggly hedge beside the local

burger joint, and subsist on burger scraps, milkshakes, and the occasional slug or bug

that crawls their way.

They are a poor but happy family.”

From these lines we know that

4. Sonic's family lives in an actual hedge, which is I guess why they're called hedgehogs.

And 5. They have a very similar diet to me.

“Unfortunately, Sonny’s dad died when Sonny was just a few days old, after falling

into a gurgling, festering vat of toxic waste dumped in a nearby pond.”

…

What

Sonic, the lighthearted hedgehog we all know and love.

Never knew his father because he was reduced to sludge thanks to corporate pollution.

There are 30 key tenets in the Sonic bible,

and I'm just gonna go ahead and list them off real quick.

just a big ol' mess of words from the Sonic bible

The 30 tenets of the Sonic the Hedgehog bible.

Look at 'em up there.

Beautiful.

Practically glowing with potential energy.

The potential energy I shall release into a HOLY FLAME, SO THAT I MIGHT BURN OUT THE

BLASPHEMY FROM SONIC'S MODERN ITERATIO...

Pat I think, uh, we should probably just take a couple minutes, just to, just to like...

Brian Okay.

Pat I'll... do you need water or anything

Brian Water... yeah, I think that'd be good.

Now, most of these are not found in most of the iterations of Sonic, but there are three

that specifically decanonize every game in the Sonic franchise.

Let's talk about 'em.

Number 18 There are seven chaos emeralds, one is a stabilizer.

You might have heard me say the name Kintobor.

He turns into Dr. Robotnik after he is fused the powers of the chaos emeralds and a hard-boiled egg.

Not a joke.

But he was originally looking for the chaos emeralds so that we he could bundle them up

and then launch them into space, thus reversing all pollution on the planet Earth.

The reason for that is because the Chaos Emeralds “contain a microlytic copy of all the inert

energy of every gross and disgusting impulse or deed done by humans since the beginning of time.”

Ignoring that microlytic is the name of a company and not an actual scientific term,

this seems to state that the chaos emeralds are just a crystalline form of every gross impulse.

Every time you pick your nose instead of using a tissue.

That’s in the emerald.

Every time you wear your underwear five times in a week 'cause you think it doesn't smell that bad.

That's in the emerald.

Every time you go three days without shampooing

I get it.

Look, sometimes, you know, the shampoo has sulfates and that can damage to your hair.

We all have different scalps.

BUT THAT'S IN THE EMERALD, TOO.

Most of the games just state the chaos emeralds are an incredible source of power, something

that will help you to take over the world or become Super Sonic.

They don't ever mention that they are essentially just garbage diamonds.

Had Sega included one piece of flavor text, like “You got a chaos emerald.

You should probably go wash your hands, now.”

Then it would’ve been fine.

But they didn’t.

Number 21 Kintobor was a father figure.

Just as a reminder, Sonic’s dad died in a vat

of toxic waste.

Which is why it meant so much when Kintobor offered him an assistantship.

“Sonny was thrilled at the prospect.

Because although Sonny had never known his father, Kintobor reminded him of the kind

face in the photograph.”

Heartbreaking.

Can you imagine the drama in this

Sega, you keep trying to do these gritty reboots of Sonic.

Sonic plus gun.

Sonic plus getting kissed by a human woman.

You don’t need all that.

It's all right here!

You are literally pitting Sonic, a hedgehog without a father, against the man who became

his father figure and then turned evil thanks to the machines that SONIC HELPED CREATE.

I hear you saying, “Brian, there’s no evidence that Sonic doesn’t think of Robotnik

as a father figure!”

And to that I say bullSHIT.

I have NEVER SEEN HIM CRY AFTER DEFEATING ROBOTNIK.

I HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM HOLD THE LIFELESS BODY OF HIS FATHER FIGURE AND SAY,

I am sorry it had to turn out like this!

I am sorry!

LET SONIC CRY OVER THE LOSS OF WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN, SEGA.

YOU COWARDS.

And finally, the third and most important tenet that destroys the entirety of the Sonic canon.

Number 11 Sonic helps quilters.

Have you ever seen Sonic in a quilting circle

Cause he should be there.

“While making the rounds for juicy tidbits and gossip, he would drop in on the ladies

of the local quilting circle to offer a convenient pin or needle from his ample, portable supply.”

WHERE IS MY SONIC GAME WITH A QUILTING CIRCLE

Sonic CD shitty.

Sonic Mania trash.

Sonic Hedgehog 2.

More like Sonic the Hedgehog Too MUCH OF A DUNCE TO INCLUDE TO THE QUILTING CIRCLE THAT

IS SO INTEGRAL TO SONIC'S BACKSTORY!

And with that, we have decanonized the entirety of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise.

But from this scorched earth can bloom a mighty flower.

The true Sonic the Hedgehog.

What would that video game look like

What are the ramifications of a Sonic the Hedgehog game based on the bible

The Sonic the Hedgehog bible.

Let’s go through this piece by piece.

We start the game with a legitimate hedgehog who lives in a hedge and his name is Sonny.

And it's 2019, and he's got brown quills, and they won't become blue until he gets faster.

And he eats food that is similar to the food that I eat.

He lives in Hardly, Nebraska, which is where the entire game is set, so you better get ready

for running in lots of corn fields.

His eyesight’s not good, but it’s okay cause he’ll get rec specs since he is able

to read but is also on the track team.

So the entire game is actually just running in track meets in the middle of a corn field.

When he’s not running track, he’s at the bowling alley or the playground or the quilting

circle doing normal hedgehog things.

The problem is that his town has SO MUCH POLLUTION, which is how his dad died, and it’s also

why Kintobor (now Robotnik), the trim kindly scientist who gave Sonic his new nickname

and the ability to speak the human tongue, was trying to solve with his new physics theories

and his machines and all of those terrible gross seven chaos emeralds before he became

evil and also a bit of an egg.

This is especially rough because Kintobor, before he became Robotnik, would feed Sonic

really good food and was basically a father figure to him.

Also Sonic is good at computer science.

So the game is basically an evil polluting scientist being taken down by a midwestern

teenage hedgehog track star with daddy issues.

So it’s basically if the CW rebooted Sonic.

Reach out to me, CW, I will license this.

But I haven’t used all 30 of these tenets.

See, there are four of them that, to be perfectly honest, shouldn’t be possible.

And beyond that, they are impossible to put into a game.

I've hit a bit of a roadblock.

Number seven shows Sonic's dead father winking at him through a picture on the wall, which

proves the existence of an afterlife in the Sonic Universe.

Number 15 shows that Sonic is able to hibernate below delta waves.

And those are the slowest possible brain waves.

About 0.5 hertz.

To go below them, Sonic would have probably died.

And yet he is resurrected and lives again.

And number 24, Sonic is shown to run at the speed of light.

And if the rules of relativity are to be believed, that means his mass would have to infinitely

expand, and he would need infinite energy to do this.

And that would destroy the world.

And yet he is able to do that without harming himself or those around him.

Number 30 is actually within the bible itself.

It states, “But like most peaceful times in the twenty-first century, it didn’t last long.”

This bible was written in 1991, nine years before the twenty-first century, and yet it

prophesied our challenging political landscape.

These four pieces of information are not purely canonical information.

They are...

divine miracles.

So of course I could not put them into a game.

They could only fit in a religion.

So I went on to wikiHow, the foremost explainer of how to do things, and I knew somewhere,

hidden in their beautiful imagery would be the way that I could spread the word of Sonic

to the masses.

And before you get upset with me, saying,

Brian, aren't you just starting a cult

Look at this question answered by Cutegirlcorr

Technically speaking, religions and cults are the same thing.

So I have formed my religion around Sonic the Hedgehog.

And guess what

I have a confession!

I'VE NEVER PLAYED A SONIC GAME.

NEVER IN MY LIFE.

I only tell you this now because you've already made it this far into the video,

and the sunk cost fallacy states that if you feel like you've invested something,

you're gonna see it through to the end.

But it's okay that I haven't played a Sonic game.

Because that means I haven't been tainted!

I have never beheld the false Sonic!

Only someone blind to the modern blasphemies of the Sonic franchise

could see as clearly as I!

Because if a hedgehog could commune with the dead,

be resurrected,

run with infinite energy,

and HAVE HIS GOSPEL PROPHECY THE FUTURE,

THEN EITHER SONIC IS A GOD

OR COULD KILL GOD

AND I DO NOT CARE IF THERE IS A DIFFERENCE!

Hello, friends, I’d like to take a moment now and apologize for my recent outburst.

I’ve taken some time and cooled down since filming this video, and though I suppose I

could have just not uploaded it to YouTube, I decided it would serve well as a cautionary tale.

You see, taking lore to be purely literal, whether that's for a video game or backstory

for a TV show, is a dangerous rabbit hole that can often lead to anger.

Biblical literalism is just an early form of fandom.

Sometimes, you gotta be a little bit more lenient.

Because sometimes, the bible was written to make a character

more marketable to kids in the '90s.

So let’s learn from this example, and make sure to take new additions to our favorite things in stride.

Even if it’s these legs.

I’m sorry, I can't in good conscience agree with that.

I do not agree with those legs.

I'm sorry.

I could spr... if you spray painted my legs blue, I could cosplay as this Sonic.

Do you think I should do that

Do you think I should spray paint my legs blue for a Sonic cosplay

Just half...

Just half, half down Sonic.

Not gonna do anything else to my body, just...

everyone loses it 
 2020-06-25 16:20:08,563 - DEBUG - file running:  Stamina! That mysterious green juice that powers our muscles.

In video games, it allows characters to cleave dragons, climb volcanoes,

and lightly jog through a prairie.

I look at these heroic tasks, and I think…

How?

Look, I’m usually pretty high energy, but the fact of the matter is that

I’ve been stuck at home for the past two months

and I’ve cultivated the stamina of a cartoon basset hound.

I used to be so much more productive, and my energy has just completely vanished.

Is it because I’ve been having trouble adjusting to this new working-from-home lifestyle?

Or is it because my build is trash?

Today, I’m saying goodbye to that boring, languid Brian, and I am going to use the things I’ve learned

from video games to maximize my stamina.

*synth music*

I gotta go ham on these graphics ‘cause I don’t have a studio anymore.

There are two main ways that stamina is represented in video games:

stamina bars that automatically replenish, and stamina bars that don’t.

And these different representations lead to different techniques for boosting that stamina.

My hypothesis is that if I use these same stamina techniques in real life,

then I will finally have the energy to address laundry chair.

*Sad accordion music*

There are four methods of augmenting your stamina in video games.

Let’s start with the easiest one to understand. Item Refills.

You expend some energy, you eat something to replenish that energy. It's basic biology.

The Krebs cycle or something like that…

I am not interested, get that shit outta here.

The problem is that most video games are usually more fantastical than real life.

Oftentimes the item you need to consume is an elixir made from arcane magicks

siphoned from the very lifeblood that sustains our world.

Or, if you’re Hideo Kojima, it’s Monster Energy.

God bless you Death Stranding for having a magical canteen

that effortlessly turns dangerous Timefall into a branded energy drink.

You know, for a video game that loves to give you a 40-minute-long cutscene

explaining why some dipshit is named "HOTWETMAN" or whatever,

this piece of world building has a much simpler explanation:

MONEY.

And thanks to this shameless product placement, I have a concrete way to determine how to refill stamina.

Judging by Sam’s experience, it takes about 600 milliliters of Monster Energy to fully juice your bar.

And given the fact that this logic exists in a world where everyone is stuck in isolated homes

and delivery people are among the most important of essential workers,

I think it’s safe to say that conditions could not be better suited for this experiment.

The biggest difference between me and Sam Bridges is that I’m not getting paid by Monster Energy,

so I don’t have to pretend to like it.

Technique 2: Slowing Depletion.

Unlike item refills, this one asks you to do some planning.

You only consume one of these items before you have to do a huge task,

so it usually shows up in games where preparation is key,

like when you have to go fight a 40-ton pickle.

Monster Hunter has battles that can last upwards of an hour,

which can make the preparation as important, and as long, as the actual fight itself.

Kinda like eating a full pasta bake before the big track meet.

There are quite a few ways to slow stamina depletion in Monster Hunter,

but sometimes the simplest option is the best one,

and in this case, the simplest option is steak.

Steak is made from raw meat in Monster Hunter

— and also the real world —

and if you eat it, it boosts your max stamina.

But the effects change based on how you cook it.

A rare steak refills your stamina bar and makes it longer,

but a well-done steak does all that AND it slows your max stamina depletion.

The steak snobs among you may turn up your nose at the assertion

that a well-done meat is better than a wet, juicy, rare one…

But I posit to you this question:

Which one would you rather have jangling around in your leather satchel?

So I’ll be cooking these meats until they are all-the-way gray.

Technique 3: Stamina Regeneration.

With this technique, every time you use stamina, you’ll get it back faster.

And there is no game that makes you say,

“come on refill come on come ON COME ON COME ON REFI-”

more than Dark Souls.

In Dark Souls you consume stamina every time you attack, block, run, parry, roll, backstep,

backstab, ripost, jump, shoot arrows, call your mom, check your bank account…

And if you’re in the middle of a boss fight and you have run out of the stamina necessary

to dodge roll or swing your big sword,

well, them’s the breaks, kid.

Luckily, there are some accessories that speed up that stamina regeneration.

And even more luckily, you can purchase legitimate versions of these items for about... 300 bucks.

Uh, no thank you. I can make that at home.

And even if I did have the means to purchase these official props,

there’s still one massive problem.

The in-game items are imbued with dark, abyssal magicks

that I simply do not have the arcane wisdom to conjure.

Luckily, I do have one little piece of magic I can use.

It’s called: The placebo effect!

There are plenty of psych studies that show that clothing choices

can have an effect on our mood and your confidence,

and there are even more studies that show that placebos can have legitimate beneficial effects,

so why wouldn’t donning The Mask of the Child help me deal with laundry chair?

*More sad accordion music*

And finally, technique 4: Permanent Increases.

This is by far the best way to maximize your stamina.

When you’ve got all the stamina in the world, even the heaviest of tasks won’t phase you.

There are plenty of realistic games that use this technique, like Red Dead Redemption 2,

where the only way to increase your max stamina is to do a bunch of stamina heavy tasks, like sprinting.

But the thing about this technique is that…

IT SUCKS.

UH, I’M SORRY?! You’re telling me that in order to have more energy,

I have to use up all the little energy I have? That’s recursive logic.

I don’t have any energy to begin with, and you want me to run a mile? Bullshit!

So since Rockstar doesn’t actually care about realism, let’s talk about a more grounded game:

Breath of the Wild.

In this game, Link can trade four spirit orbs to increase his hearts or his stamina.

But I want to focus on this little guy, the Horned Statue.

Here, you can do a different sort of trade… a devil’s bargain. You can increase your max stamina...

YOU JUST HAVE TO GIVE UP SOME LIFE.

The only problem is that I can't figure out how I would gain more stamina

by doing something physically detrimental, like using a shampoo with sulfates.

I would never do that.

So for now, I’ll be focusing on the first three techniques.

Here’s how the experiment will go: I will spend one day on each technique,

rating my stamina level every hour of that day.

If I’m at a 0, then I’m either sleeping or dead, so most of my stamina levels will be between 1 and 10,

with a 1 being the stamina level of a hotboxed sloth,

and a 10 being the energy of a 6-year-old at a laser tag party who just finished his first can of mello yello.

My goal is to be at a level 10 at all times.

I’ll also be rating the boosts based on three criteria: Boost speed, Boost endurance, and Boost Quality.

But first, we have to do a control trial. Which is just a normal day.

“Just after 7 o'clock on a Monday. I'd say my power level is at a 5. I'm about to have some coffee."

I went about my day as I normally do, which is to say, boringly.

If we take a look at this graph, you’ll see that there were two little spikes.

The first one, which happened after I had my morning coffee,

and the second one after I hit a real low spot right after lunch.

I have no idea if I’m pointing to the right places.

“It's half past one. I decided to be productive by at least leaving my house.

Gonna go buy a liter of Monster.

You can't tell because I'm wearing a mask, but I'm grimacing under here."

This is obviously just one control trial,

but it is emblematic of the lethargy I’ve been feeling for the past few weeks.

I never got above an 8, and in fact my average for the full day

was just a little bit higher than how I was feeling right after I woke up. That’s pretty bad.

But it means there's nowhere to go but up.

And I’ll be going WAY UP with the first technique trial.

“Feeling about a 5, not super tired, not super energetic.

But instead of making coffee, I instead will go and take a swig from my canteen,

which I have filled up with three different Monster Energy drinks, up to the liter mark.

If I'm at halfway through my stamina right now, I should be drinking 300 milliliters. Let's see if this kicks in!"

And the effects of Sam Bridges’ favorite concoction did, indeed, kick in. "8 o'clock!

Let's, okay, obviously the energy drink has, uh, affected me. Let me put this down so I

can move around with my hands. I can still have more stamina. Yeah, I feel like I'm at

an 8 right now. You know normally I'd say that that's fine. I'm trying to be at the

peak performance level. Another 120 milliliters down the hatch. Let's do some work, baby!

*singing* Don't mind me, just gonna do some work right now. Feeling fine! Probably a 9.

Or maybe a 9 and a half! Maybe a 10? Probably... I'll, mmm, 9 and a half. Can we get waffle

fries? Does anyone deliver waffle fries? NO FILMING! Let's go write more scripts!" Things

were going great for me in the stamina department. Until they weren’t. *incoherent mumbling*

"The crash, and then right after eating lunch has kind of... just brought the whole thing

down to a 3. Now that I have seen that Monster gives me a super high and then immediately

crashes me, I’m going to do the only thing a sane person would do, and consume more monster

energy. Let's go to work!” And though I went searching for that magnificent, full

stamina feeling I fleetingly experienced in that morning, I still averaged less than the

control trial for the rest of the afternoon. I drank 3 full cans of Monster Energy.

“If I hadn’t had the monster energy, would I have been dead right now? I don't understand.”

There was only one little spike that happened after I had to go outside to pick up steaks

for the next day’s trials, and though the energy drinks didn’t keep me up all night,

there were some other side effects, that ultimately led to a bad review of this technique. “My

body is tired, but my mind is just, there's some anxieties in there? And also I feel,

like, physically not great." Still I had high hopes for Trial 2. Since the previous two

trials trended downward, I had hoped that Slowing Depletion would help. Unfortunately,

due to the previous day’s trials, I was operating at a deficit. "Went to bed alright

and then I woke up about 2 hours after that, and then kept waking up every 30 minutes.

I'll tell you what, more than anything in the world, what I would love to do is go ahead

and brew myself a pot of coffee, but you know what, I’ll do you one better.

Super cheap, beef eye-round steak.

I’m gonna ahead and grill one of these puppies up to a healthy 160 degrees Fahrenheit.

Let’s get some breakfast going.”

I tried my best to go into this experience unbiased, and honestly, the first steak of the day wasn’t that bad.

“I feel more powerful."

And though it didn’t give me quite the same bump as the Monster Energy,

my stamina levels rose and stayed level for the entire morning.

“It feels like I'm maintaining it a lot better.

Maybe I really am not degrading my stamina. It is almost lunchtime.

Maybe I'll eat two well-done medallions of steak."

That’s exactly what I did. Sadly, the second meats of the day were not as wonderful,

and this is where the true challenge of this technique came in.

“I do really wish I was eating something other than this.

The problem is that I'm still very hungry, and... but I also don't want to eat any more well-done steaks.”

With my stomach rumbling and my stamina flagging, I decided to try to take my mind off it by

working on the accessories for the next day’s trials. And this did give me a little stamina boost,

and that stamina maintained, but other things weren’t going so hot.

“Great, stamina’s going alright, but I am so hungry,

and also so upset with idea that I have to eat more of these well-done pucks of meat.

But I'm gonna make the last two!

Now a lot of you might be wondering, doesn’t it get easier over time?

And the answer is obviously no.”

By the end of the day, it's easy to see that though my stamina didn't get quite as high,

it did last longer, so there might be some truth to this slowing degradation technique.

But unlike the Monster Energy trial,

this one was both literally and metaphorically harder to swallow.

There’s a reason energy drinks aren’t chewable.

Luckily, our final trial didn’t make me consume anything.

“I slept a little bit better last night, at least, so I'd say I'm at, like, a 4.

But the goodnews is that I know just what to do. Let me go put on my accessories.

I already feel energized.”

Okay, full disclosure, as much as I believe video game logic,

I did just tape some tin foil onto some cardboard.

I wasn’t expecting much from this trial.

But the results speak for themselves.

“Why don’t I carry around a shield more often!

This makes me feel so powerful!”

I had a morning boost that rivaled Item Refills!

Sure, working in full garb was a little bit annoying,

but that didn’t stop me from being an active participant in my virtual meetings.

"Yeah, I can, I can help out with that, Jenna, if you need any extra help on that one."

Jenna - "Yeah, Brian. I guess so."

But around 11, the mask and shield were getting to me,

so I started altering which of the accessories I was wearing.

There’s no set bonus, so as long as I have one item equipped,

my stamina regeneration should be a little bit faster than normal.

“For the past hour, I took off the mask, and I’ve just been living on the Chloranthy Ring.

I do feel more tired. I'm gonna rethink about the mask."

At 1:30, I had to do a stream, and I did that in the mask.

And sure enough, my stamina was boosted after that experience.

In fact for most of the day, the accessories helped and didn’t make my stomach hurt,

but there were other costs.

“I don’t like wearing this mask.

I feel like my stamina has increased. But it seems like there's an obvious trade off going on here,

because, like, it's not, it’s not comfortable to wear. You can see, like, it's been squishing my nose.

I’m deciding whether or not I want to have higher energy levels or if I want to feel comfortable,

is really what's happening at the moment."

Take a look right there.

I imagine that the Wright Brothers wore a similar expression the day they went to Kitty Hawk,

because that is the face of a man who is ready to soar.

Remember how I said I couldn’t figure out how to trade health for stamina?

Well judging from these previous trials,

each one of them was physically detrimental in a specific and wonderful way.

"I feel, like, physically not great."

"Why am I still so hungry?"

"It's not comfortable to wear."

Perhaps I could trade my health for more stamina by doing every technique at once.

Welcome to The Final Trial!

“Waking up this morning and realizing what I was going to have to do today

really just made me not want to get out of bed.

I am about to do all three stamina things at once.

I’m not expecting it to feel good, but I am expecting

an increase in productivity unlike... anyone has ever seen from me.”

So after donning my outfit and grilling up a well-done steak,

I sat down for breakfast.

“God I hate this steak.”

And by 9 o’clock, I felt the effects.

“I think maybe god didn’t intend for us to wake up and drink an energy drink

and eat a well-done steak and then wear a tin foil mask.

I’m at a 5.”

Okay, so the boost didn’t happen right away,

but let’s remember that some of these boosts take a while to warm up.

And given the fact that I'm increasing my max stamina,

I should be hitting a 10, maybe an 11 or 12, by midmorning.

Except things didn’t change.

“It's 10 o'clock and I'm still at a 5. What the hell?

I'm just gonna cook all the steaks, I'm gonna drink all the energy drink, I'm gonna wear this while I'm doing it.

I'm just gonna do it all right now. I'm tired of this. I'm also physically tired."

I ate four steaks.

I drank all of the rest of my energy drink.

I was GOING to increase my maximum stamina.

“I’m ready to take on the day.”

*pained moan*

It turns out that doing every single stamina boosting technique at once fills your stamina bar so full,

that the bar explodes.

I felt physically ill and had to lie down for several hours.

I can’t even review this boost technique because it just knocked me unconscious.

But I will say that I did rebound later that day.

“So I left my house.

Came out here to take a little walk while maintaining adequate social distance.

I feel... I feel a WHOLE lot better.

You can't tell, but I'm smiling under this."

And this made me rethink some of my trials.

Most of my afternoon boosts weren’t due to gimmicky ingestibles, they were because I took a small walk,

or I did a fun craft, or I talked to my friends online.

Was I doing these techniques for nothing?

Is video game logic wrong?

No.

I just didn't understand what video games were teaching me.

Getting good at Dark Souls or Monster Hunter is about knowing how many swings of your big sword

you can do before you need to take a break.

It only becomes a major issue if you completely run out, and you have to spend a few seconds staggered,

or spend a few hours lying in bed.

Maybe the real stamina technique I need to learn is recognizing that, right now,

I may not be able to do as much as I want to.

But if I focus on the little wins,

I can manage my stamina, and I can manage my expectations for my stamina.

So although I may still wear the Chloranthy Ring, it will just be for the fashion.

And today, I’m gonna take care of laundry chair.

You tell me when the camera stops rolling so I can stop folding.

*SYNTH BANGER* 
 2020-06-25 16:20:08,563 - DEBUG - file running:  WALUIGI.

The tall bastard man that Nintendo loves to disrespect. We know he's number one.

But who really is he? And where did he come from?

And why hasn’t Nintendo given him his own game.

The cult following of Waluigi cannot be overstated. He is an icon.

The patron saint of weird content creators.

But isn’t it strange that this character so beloved by Nintendo fans

seems to be completely disregarded by the company?

I don’t believe that’s actually the truth.

Nintendo cares almost too much about their characters.

They rarely put a character into a game unless they're 100% sure it’s a good fit.

And I think this is the reason why Waluigi has been sidelined:

Nintendo doesn’t know what Waluigi is all about.

So, Doug Bowser, I have collected every single piece of Waluigi lore into this one

simple video, and I’ll be presenting it to you, so you can finally make that Waluigi game.

Wahaha!

That was my first attempt, I'll get better.

In order to understand Waluigi perfectly,

we have to take a look at every appearance he's made in a Nintendo game.

They’re the only ones that count toward canon.

If you'd like me to discuss Waluigi's noncanonical appearances, I can definitely do that for you, Doug,

it'll just have to be in my off hours

because it is DEFINITELY not safe for work.

Here’s every Waluigi appearance sorted by release date.

These 63 games contain the entirety of Waluigi’s characterization.

He is playable in 50 of them, and we can split those playable games into Sports and Party Games.

I combed through each of these appearances, grasping at any piece of Waluigi characterization,

but the vast majority of them treat Waluigi as a meat puppet. A space filler.

An extra body on the character select screen. And, honestly, that’s one way to see Waluigi.

I hear you, Doug Bowser. Why should I care about a space filler character?

Well, you already care about a space filler character.

A little fella named Mario.

Let’s discuss Waluigi’s counterparts to shed some light on his origin.

The original Donkey Kong was supposed to have Popeye characters, but Nintendo couldn’t get the license,

so Shigeru Miyamoto created an unnamed player character as a stand in.

And that space filler was later named Mario.

People think that characters have to have some deep backstory in order for people

to like them, but that’s NOT TRUE. People love Mario BECAUSE of his humble origins.

The same cannot be said about the rightfully despised coward boy that is Luigi.

You see, Luigi was made because they needed a player 2 in the game, so they just palette swapped Mario.

That is a character filling a space by copying another filled space.

As much as I hate to admit it, I will have to revisit Luigi later in this video,

because he is key to developing the personality of Waluigi, and that's partially because of Wario.

Wario wasn’t made by Miyamoto. Supposedly, the team behind Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins

didn’t enjoy being forced to make a Mario game because they didn’t create the character.

So Hiroji Kiyotake created a bad Mario, someone that had all of Mario's evils exaggerated.

And finally, we have Waluigi, who was created by the same character designer who worked on Golden Sun.

The guy who made Saturos and Isaac and all of these intense powerful characters

used his talents to make the most intense, most powerful character.

And he made him for a very important reason:

because Wario didn’t have a doubles partner in Mario Tennis.

If Wario is just the evil exaggerated form of Mario, then Waluigi's the same for Luigi.

And that’s really all we get from Waluigi’s first encounter.

That, and the fact that Luigi is not afraid of him.

*Mario Tennis music plays*

"Luigi not afraid."

Luigi, the milksop who is afraid of all, is not afraid of his evil, funhouse mirror twin.

There’s something to that, but I don't know if I can quite grasp it without discussing all of the lore first.

So let’s switch back here.

As I mentioned before the tangent, Waluigi often plays the role of meat puppet,

so not all of these games have lore that is useful to us in developing a Waluigi game.

So I’ll take them off the board.

After cutting, we're left with 5 references to Waluigi, 7 party games, and 13 sports games.

From these 25 appearances, we can take all the juicy morsels and put them into a list of Waluigi Truths.

Let’s start with the references.

Though Super Smash has notoriously snubbed our large purple child,

the trophies do a pretty good job of fleshing out his character.

Super Smash Bros. Melee lays out 8 Waluigi Truths in just three sentences:

Four things right there: Tall. Thin. Evil looking. “Seems” to be Luigi’s rival.

That one isn’t really definitive, so we’ll keep it ambiguous.

Waluigi is a mischief maker, and he takes it seriously.

Luigi is exactly the same age as Waluigi, and I do not know who that reflects worse on.

Also, I love that Waluigi is connected to Wario, but no one's ever cared to take a closer look.

Are they friends, accomplices,

lovers?

It’s unclear!

The next Smash games really hammer home these truths,

only adding that he must also have a crooked mustache, a large nose, and a love of kicking.

Hmm.

*crashing noise*

The final reference comes from Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle,

where a large rabbid called Bwaluigi appears.

This is the closest Waluigi has ever come to appearing in a plot-based Mario game.

A fucking rabbid has had more screen time than the original Waluigi.

What can we learn from this?

As we move onto the party games, a lot of Waluigi’s lore is reiterated.

The main additions are that he is a misanthrope who loves to party.

There are two strange pieces of info in the party games.

In Mario Party 5, each pairing gets a different team name, and Mario plus Waluigi are “Psuedo Bros.”

Not enemies.

It seems like Mario is okay working with Waluigi instead of Luigi.

The second weird piece of info is in Mario Party 4, where Waluigi is described with the quote:

“That Waluigi's a serious sneak! Watch out for his Sparky Sticker..."

This quote doesn’t have any useful info for us, but the phrase “watch out for his sparky sticker”

is the worst and I hate it and why’d you put it in a family friendly video game, Nintendo?

Finally, we have the Sports games, where Waluigi started.

Mario Tennis set the tone for Waluigi with two truths.

One, that he’s highly skilled as a technique player. And two, that Luigi is not afraid of him.

This one's still weird to me.

These ones all have quotes that reiterate what we know about Waluigi.

He's hardworking and he's skilled, even if he cheats sometimes.

We have some metaphysical characterization in Super Mario Strikers, where the legend states

“Waluigi's ego tends to be his biggest enemy.”

In Mario Hoops 3-on-3, his Baller Name is “The Question.”

Which I think just solidifies him as an enigma.

Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games shows that Waluigi is a great jumper,

and Waluigi’s special move in Mario Super Sluggers is the Liar Ball, which is a ball that

he splits into two copies, one real and one false,

which emphasizes his mischievousness.

In Mario Power Tennis, there is a blooper reel where Waluigi is aware that this is all a show.

Does this mean that Waluigi is able to break the fourth wall,

or does it prove what I already knew,

that Waluigi is great on camera.

It's hot under these lights, anyone else hot in here? I'm just gonna pop this bad boy off if that's okay.

*crashing sound*

And in Mario Tennis: Power Tour, Waluigi appears without Wario.

Their relationship was never clear, but it is surprising that Waluigi, who was built to be Wario’s tennis partner,

can appear in a tennis game without him.

Luigi’s still there. Why can’t Waluigi exist without Luigi, save us all a headache.

And that’s basically all of the Waluigi lore you can learn from the games. The 23 Waluigi Truths.

And you can use them to create a Waluigi video game.

And I could stop this video here, Doug,

but I’ll tell you what, I'll do you a favor.

I'll tell you what I think the Waluigi game should look like, since I’ve done the research for ya.

If you’re gonna make a Waluigi game, you're gonna need to make it distinct.

Nintendo does a great job of tying gameplay to what makes a character special.

Mario’s got platformers locked. Wario has eccentric greedy microgames.

Luigi...

you know what, let’s actually go through Luigi’s truths and see how it led to Luigi’s Mansion.

Luigi is foolish, he's a coward, he's weak, he's pitiful.

And you take these truths and you think, hmmm, what kind of setting would allow this mistake of

a human to really exhibit his uselessness?

A haunted house!

This man has been bamboozled into comedic haunted house entrapment three times,

something most Hollywood stooges have only been duped into once.

He’s a big dumb idiot, and I would HATE to be associated with him.

But Waluigi is Luigi’s twisted reflection, so his game will be far removed from this numpty.

Let’s make it.

First, we're gonna move the truths that are physical traits to the side, since they're baked into Waluigi.

Next we have to decide on a cast of characters.

Honestly, Waluigi has been sidelined for so long that this needs to be a solo mission.

Now, let’s talk about the rest of these truths.

If you were to separate them out, you could probably make dozens of different games.

A mischievous prank game. A, uh, game where Waluigi gets schwasty every night.

And I’m not opposed to these games, but Waluigi contains multitudes.

Why does he turn to mischief? Why does he work so hard only to be cast aside by society?

Who is this enigma of a man, whose true enemy is himself?

The Waluigi game, like the man,

should be a mystery.

Nintendo already has wonderful mystery games, but they’re too cute.

Waluigi is raw. He's real. To convey the complex emotions of a complex man,

we can’t rely on traditional animation styles.

The Waluigi video game

should be Full Motion Video.

Doug, I know this is a wild concept. Nintendo is not known for live action video mysteries,

but Waluigi is just the intellectual property to explore this new genre.

Imagine Waluigi as a hard-nosed investigator, struggling to pick apart the pieces of who he is.

A man solving himself.

I mean, there is the issue of casting.

You gotta find someone who’s evil looking, and has a crooked mustache,

and a big nose and is great at jumping.

And, you know, that's a... that's a hard task to find one guy who's got all those features, you know, I...

Well now, wait a second, Doug.

If you take a look at my truths, you'll find that they're nearly the same as Waluigi's.

I’m hard working, I’m a bit of a scamp, and though I might not be as tall and lean,

there’s enough of me that WANTS to be Waluigi that I’d devote everything to being him.

I need this role, Doug.

I’ve spent the past few months devising this pitch for you. No one wants this more,

cares more about Waluigi than I do.

I will fight Charles Martinet for this role.

Is that what you want, Doug?

YOU PICK THE WEAPONS.

I WILL END HIS CAREER.

And that’s why I hope you’ll consider me for Waluigi’s Currently Untitled Full Motion Video Game.

But there’s something that's still nagging at me.

I’m sure you noticed that I didn’t address all of these Waluigi truths.

Why does every single quote state that Waluigi "thinks” he’s Luigi’s rival?

You could read this as Waluigi not being important enough for Luigi to consider him as a rival,

but why go through the trouble of putting that in EVERY SINGLE description?

Why not just make their rivalry canon?

And the fact that Luigi is not afraid of him is mind boggling.

Luigi’s personality is 90% fear and 10% being green.

Mario is shocked when Waluigi appears, and yet Luigi is calm,

like he somehow expected him.

And if Waluigi thinks his biggest rival is Luigi, then how can his actual biggest enemy be his ego?

Does that make Luigi the ego to Waluigi's id? A-a-and if...

"You can't have a Waluigi without a Luigi." "He splits into two copies, one real and one false."

"Pseudo Bros. Not enemies." "Why can't Waluigi exist without Luigi?"

Luigi and Waluigi are the same person.

*Vesti la Giubba starts playing*

It’s so simple. Luigi is just manifesting his own repressed desires as an alternate personality,

a shocking twist that no one's ever done in media before.

Waluigi is just the exaggerated form of Luigi’s deepest desires.

The want to be skilled. The want to be respected.

The want to PARTY.

Waluigi is everything Luigi wishes he could be but could never be

under the famous gaze of his famous brother.

What an amazing twist. What an amazing truth.

What an amazing role for me as Waluigi.

Think of the accolades, the game awards, the respect.

As someone who wished to be Waluigi for so many years!

As someone... who wished...

If there are two personalities, am I number one, or am I the one who is longing?

Oh god. I'm not a Waluigi.

I’m a Luigi.

No no no... Nonononononono!

*mirror shatters*

*shaver buzzes*

And that’s just ONE potential ending to Waluigi’s Currently Untitled Full Motion Video Game.

If you’re interested in licensing the idea, Doug, feel free to reach out to my agent,

and we can get filming tomorrow.

Or in like… five months 'cause I am gonna have to grow the mustache back-

I probably shouldn't have shaved it before we...

You know what, I don't have an agent, so just don't contact me.

I don't want to play Luigi, so.

Pat- "Can you sob while doing it?" Brian - "Okay."

*sobbing while shaving*

Pat - "Head back."

*Brian gags and coughs* *Jenna and Pat laugh*

Brian - It's so hard to sob while shaving because it gets in your mouth. 
 2020-06-25 16:20:08,563 - DEBUG - file running:  I love the Legend of Zelda series.

But the canonical timeline doesn’t make any sense!

Perhaps it would make more sense if someone tried to put every single piece of Zelda media,

canonical and noncanonical, into one timeline.

Someone should try to do that.

Let’s go!

Let’s start with the canonical timeline.

So we’ve got Skyward Sword at the very beginning.

Created Demise, and then he becomes Ganon later on.

Link gets resurrected.

It’s Minish Cap.

It introduces Vaati.

He’s a wind sorcerer.

And then he also shows up in Four Swords.

That comes next.

After Four Swords, Vaati is sealed, Ganon’s back, baby!

And it’s Ocarina of Time.

So Ocarina of Time splits into three different timelines here.

In one of them, Link decides to stay an adult, Ganondorf gets resurrected, and Link is nowhere

to be found.

And where’s Link?

Where’s Link?

I’ll get to it, don’t worry, I’ll get to it.

And then the whole world floods, and we get Wind Waker.

This one I’ll call “Adult Link.”

In this one, he decides to stay a child, the sacred realm is sealed, he’s finished his

entire meaning of existence by the time he’s like 12, and so he goes and does Majora’s

Mask, which is also very existential.

And then over here, Nintendo decided to make a timeline where Link loses.

Link just can’t do it in this one.

Ganondorf does whatever the hell he wants to, and now it’s A Link to the Past.

One of my friends invited me over to watch him beat Ocarina of Time, because he was really

close to finishing it, and then I went over and then he couldn’t do it, and so then

we decided to go outside and play basketball.

This is that timeline.

So we have “Adult Link,” “Child Link,” “Basketball.”

Let’s go back to “Adult Link.”

After Wind Waker, he just goes and hangs out with pirate friends in Phantom Hourglass.

We go to Spirit Tracks.

This is on a different island, and technically there is Link and Zelda, except Link is really

into trains now.

Let’s do the child one!

We go from Majora’s Mask into what is canonically called the Era of Twilight.

Obviously, it’s Twilight Princess next.

Then it gets a little bit darker and goes into the Age of Shadow.

We do Four Swords Adventures, which is different from Four Swords.

One has Adventures in the title.

Here’s some issues with canon over here in “Basketball” timeline.

In the Hyrule Historia, which came out in 2011, it states that next should be Oracle

of Seasons and Oracle of Ages, but the Japanese Zelda website technically states that it goes

Link to the Past, Link’s Awakening now.

So they’ve reversed those two.

So even the canonical timeline isn’t, like, super hard set-in-stone canonical, which goes

to show that it sucks.

He does this thing and then he goes sailing and then he crashes and has a dream and then

dies in the ocean.

I’m gonna keep Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages tied together right now.

A new Link, new cycle, and he goes A Link Between Worlds.

And then it’s another existential crisis, but this is my favorite one because instead

of having an existential crisis and then going to have to save the world from a moon, or

having an existential crisis and hanging out with pirates, he just gets really into fashion

in Tri Force Heroes, which is what I plan to do in my midlife crisis.

It’s The Legend of Zelda, the first one!

Zelda II: The Adventure of Link.

This is the same Link between these two.

A cult wants to resurrect Ganon or something.

We’re at the most recent game, and the most recent in the timeline, it’s Breath of the Wild.

You might be wondering, where does Breath of the Wild fall?

In which timeline?

Is it “Basketball,” is it “Child,” or is it “Adult?”

Well guess what: IT’S ALL THREE.

NINTENDO COULDN’T FIGURE IT OUT, SO THEY DECIDED TO JUST PUT IT IN ALL OF THE TIMELINES.

WHICH ISN’T HOW TIME WORKS…

TO MY KNOWLEDGE.

*vague gesturing*

I’m gonna make this timeline much worse, but I’m gonna also explain the convergence.

So what I’m gonna go to next is Zelda spinoff games.

I’m not gonna talk about some specific things, namely cameos, or when you can buy Link’s

clothing in other games, or some of the mangas because they’re just the same exact stories

as some of the main canonical timeline games.

I’ve wrapped all of these up.

Some of them don’t have connections yet.

Don’t worry, I’ll get to it.

Let’s start with the easy Zelda spinoffs.

There were a lot of them during Twilight Princess.

Link was also learning how to use his crossbow for big game hunting, and also it was Twilight

Princess Picross.

Midna wanted to… she thought picross would help him…

beat Zant.

We’ll start from the beginning.

Skyward Sword was supposed to be the first one, but they’re wrong.

Hylia chose her first hero, there was, like, a lot of time between the first hero and the

one that happened in Skyward Sword, and in that time was the Zelda Game & Watch.

Just like in Skyward Sword, there was an upper level and a bottom level, and then there were

dragons also in Skyward Sword.

That’s my logic behind this one.

You say “Zelda Game & Watch, what about the Zelda Game Watch?”

That’s right, the Nelsonic Zelda Game Watch.

This was a watch that you could play Zelda on, and there were only four dragons in this one.

Why?

Because the other Link already defeated the other ones!

There were three other dragons in Skyward Sword, and they were nice because they learned

that Link would fuck their shit up!

Link: The Faces of Evil and Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon.

I’m not an expert on this one because I’ve never played them.

Which I think is probably the best decision I’ve made in my life.

Right over here, why?

Because in Link: The Faces of Evil he has to go to the island of Koridai.

Islands?

In the great sea!

Obviously, that’s where they make sense to go.

Uh, Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon can go there, too.

SQUADALA!

But that’s not the only CD-i game!

There’s also Zelda’s Adventure.

Ganon, I guess he stole some celestial something-or-others, and then it started the era of darkness.

And remember what I said before about how it went to twilight and then to shadow?

What comes after that?

That’s right it’s darkness, baby!

Y’all know about the Satellaview?

It was a weird thing for the SNES, or the Super Famicom because it was just in Japan.

It insisted on all of the Satellaview games including the letters BS.

BS The Legend of Zelda: Kamigami no Triforce was just basically A Link to the Past, so

I didn’t include it in this one.

But there are other BS Legend of Zelda games, and they’re weird because they don’t actually

include Link.

They include these two characters that you could choose, and they technically part of

the Satellaview thing, so it wasn’t Link who was there, but… um…

I’ll explain in a second.

I cut one of the titles in half.

Clayton, we have to start over.

A Link to the Past happens and then Link goes away on a journey into the water and then

he dies.

What’s happening while Link goes on adventures is BS The Legend of Zelda.

It happens after that, during Link’s Awakening, when Link runs away, which is why those kids

are the ones in this.

And then after that it goes Link…

The Legend of Zelda: Ancient Stone Tablets.

And technically, since those kids are the ones that are in BS The Legend of Zelda, that

technically means that they are an iteration of Link, and so BS-X: The Story of the Town

Whose Name Was Stolen, which was a game that included those protagonists, but, um, didn’t

include anything about Zelda, technically is still a Zelda game, so I included it in

this one.

Barcode Battler II, you had to scan cards with a barcode and then you would have to

battle those enemies using it.

A different retelling of the same story as A Link to the Past, just like looking at it

from a different camera angle.

Tingle exists in actually two different timelines, and he also exists in every timeline, because

Tingle is, um, the perfect evolution of humanity.

He shows up in Majora’s Mask first, and he also shows up in Wind Waker.

We have an origin story for Tingle in Freshly Picked Tingle’s Rosy Rupeeland.

He starts to get the taste *mwah* I love rupees.

And then he starts selling his maps to you in Majora’s Mask, but at the same time as

Rosy Rupeeland is the Dekisugi Tingle Pack, which was, uh, DSiWare, and it just basically

was like a calculator, and like a fortune teller or something.

Tingle’s Balloon Fight DS.

This happens at the same time as Wind Waker.

Over here in “Basketball” timeline, we’ve got Ripened Tingle’s Balloon Trip of Love.

I’m not gonna explain how it connects just yet, because I’ll do that later.

It’s the final Zelda spinoff.

Hyrule Warriors Definitive Edition, and I’m using the definitive edition because that’s

just the collection of all of them, ‘cause there’s three different versions of this game.

I’m gonna put Hyrule Warriors over here, and I’m gonna call this the TIME BREAK.

*THE TIME BREAK*

They made three timelines already, so why can’t I make my own?

Hyrule Warriors is the second most important game in the entire timeline for how it ties

everything together.

Hyrule Warriors.

Think about that, Nintendo!

You made me care about Hyrule Warriors!

But we’re not done with Zelda games.

We’re gonna talk about Zelda character appearances.

If Miyamoto doesn’t, like, email me after this video goes up and say, “Brian, you’ve

cracked the code!”

I’m never gonna play another Zelda game ever again.

This whole goddamn suit is so tight, I feel like a Christmas ham.

I haven’t connected these two right now, because in “Adult Link” timeline, Link

just kinda slacks off, ‘cause he has, again, existential crisis.

He finished beating Ganon, what does he do for the rest of his life?

I’ll tell you what he does: He go-karts, and he fights people…

FOR SPORT.

Super Smash Bros. the original one, Mario Kart 8, and Soulcalibur II.

Got nothing better to do, might as well go have fun, and you know what, I respect that,

but you did forget that Ganondorf got resurrected, and then the whole world flooded.

So that’s on your conscience.

I imagine that Link still has, like, access to the Temple of Time, which is why in Super

Smash Bros. Melee, it happens simultaneously in Ocarina of Time, because he can change

himself into Young Link, and also Ganondorf’s there, and I don’t know why he’s allowed

to fight.

I’ve put these three Super Smash Bros. after Hyrule Warriors in the TIME BREAK.

*TIME BREAK*

And while we’re hanging out in the time break…

Sonic’s here.

Sonic’s in the time break baby!

I swear to god I’m not just using the time break as a catch-all, but it does work as

a catch-all.

There’s this weird-ass game for the Wii called Captain Rainbow.

Technically happens at the same time as Link’s Awakening because it includes Crazy Tracy,

but Link’s Awakening happens within Link’s dream, so that means that Captain Rainbow

might be happening within Crazy Tracy’s dream.

So it’s very much like Inception.

And that means that Joseph Gordon Levitt exists in the Zelda timeline.

That’s a joke.

Joseph Gordon Levitt doesn’t exist in any timeline.

And these are also gonna come down here next to Ripened Tingle’s Balloon Trip of Love.

WarioWare, all of them, and then Scribblenauts Unlimited.

And again, I will explain that later.

Phew, I’m getting too worked up about this.

Canonical games, spin-offs, Zelda appearances in other games, what’s left?

Every other type of media.

I swear to god if I get one “well actually…” comment.

That’s a lost cause, right?

Let’s start with books.

I mentioned before that Skyward Sword was not the first game and that Game & Watch was

the first game.

But it’s not the first instance of Zelda and Link.

Himekawa’s Skyward Sword manga does include the origin of literally… it’s like the

first Avatar, it’s the first Link, first Hylian chosen hero.

First instance of Link.

I really don’t know why Nintendo hasn’t included the choose-your-own-adventure books

because they love to have things that have confusing timelines where Link could potentially

die in them, like in “Basketball” over there.

The Crystal Trap and The Shadow Prince happen canonically after the original Legend of Zelda

and Zelda II.

There are, like, 11 or 12 or 18 different endings.

Stick with me here: you could win The Shadow Prince with high points or you could win The

Shadow Prince with lower points.

Those are two separate timelines in my head.

So low points from The Shadow Prince, you go to the Valiant Comics, and now we’re

gonna talk about TV.

If you win with high points, we go into The Legend of Zelda TV Series.

“Aren’t I sweet?”

After The Legend of Zelda TV Series, Captain N happens, and it’s weird because in this

one, the hero is a guy named Kevin.

He gets sucked into a television.

Captain N creates this potential option of being able to summon yourself into the game,

which explains THESE THREE THINGS.

I TOLD YOU I WOULD EXPLAIN THEM LATER!

Ripened Tingle’s Balloon Trip of Love starts with a dumb 35-year-old man who lives in his

parents’ house and then he gets sucked into a book, and then he goes into Tingle’s land

and he becomes Tingle.

WarioWare shows that the Zelda games exist at the same time which is in Captain N, and

also Scribblenauts Unlimited is here, too!

I haven’t necessarily figured that one out.

Board games!

There are Zelda board games, and they also deserve to be in the timeline.

The Legend of Zelda board game…

The Zelda board game happens if you die in The Crystal Trap, how does that sound?

Alright?

You happy?

But what about Zelda Clue?

That’s…

I guess, happens, uh, during the Super Smash Bros. time, right?

Because they’re having fun together, hanging out.

Zelda Chess!

*exasperated look at the camera*

There’s no plotline in Zelda Chess.

Put it in Ocarina of Time like everything else in this dumbass timeline.

Let me double check that I’ve gotten everything…

But what about the TIME BREAK?

*TIME BREAK*

I told you that I would explain the time break, didn’t I?

And I’m gonna explain it right now.

Why does no one understand the time break except for me, Brian David Gilbert?

Why am I the only scholar in time break studies?

I’ll tell you why.

Hyrule Warriors Definitive Edition happens outside of the timeline entirely, similarly

to Breath of the Wild.

It exists in all of the timelines because Ganondorf’s soul gets split into multiple

pieces that go into different timelines, and again, that’s in the story itself.

Link figures out that there are multiple timelines in this time.

And then he defeats the thing and he goes into existential crisis mode, just like over

here, and like over here, and like over there.

But what does he do when he knows that all of these timelines exist?

He goes and plays Super Smash Bros. with all of his friends in every single timeline.

That’s how Super Smash Bros.

Ultimate can exist, because it’s everyone, all the time, everywhere, and also Sonic!

But the time break still doesn’t fit in.

It’s still by itself over here, right?

Okay, the time break doesn’t have a space.

Link knows about every timeline, and he’s done hanging out with his friends here in

the time break, so what does he do?

He decides to settle down, get a real job.

And what can he do better than anyone else?

That’s right, he knows every location in every timeline.

I’m talking location, location, location.

HE GETS HIS REAL ESTATE LICENSE.

He buys up every land, he consolidates every timeline and pushes it all into one space.

How does he do it?

LEGEND OF ZELDA MONOPOLY.

THE MOST IMPORTANT LEGEND OF ZELDA GAME OF ALL TIME.

THE ONE THAT MAKES BREATH OF THE WILD MAKE SENSE.

REGGIE: TAKE FUCKING NOTES.

I JUST SAVED YOUR ASS WITH MONOPOLY.

THIS IS THE PIN THAT HOLDS THE ENTIRE ZELDA TIMELINE TOGETHER.

YOU MADE ME USE MONOPOLY!

That’s the entire Zelda timeline, including 55 pieces

of Zelda media.

Don’t ask me to do this again.

King Koopa.

The authoritarian turtle with a penchant for princess-napping.

His very name strikes fear into the heart of man and mushroom alike.

And he’s also pretty good at figure skating.

But when you focus on Bowser’s many attempts to put the Mushroom Kingdom under his rule,

you might forget that to order fuel his violent vanity projects,

he must put hundreds of henchmen into harm’s way.

And by harm’s way, I mean in front of Mario.

But me?

I never forget the troops.

And today I’m honoring those who have put their lives on the line for a megalomaniacal turtle.

Today, I’m presenting you with Bowser’s military hierarchy.

I can’t go any further than that, I’m sorry.

“But Brian,” I hear you ask, “Why does Bowser need a military hierarchy?”

And folks, I hear you.

I hear your questions constantly.

They come to me in my dreams like a prophet receiving visions from an angry god.

Bowser needs a military hierarchy because of the Geneva Conventions.

Y’all remember those things?

Those little rules that keep you from committing war crimes?

Look, I know Bowser is a bad dude, but I don’t think that Nintendo would actively create

a war criminal and then allow him to sit in the backseat of a go-kart with a baby.

This is thanks to how we define armed conflict.

I read through the entirety of the Geneva Conventions in order to find this information,

which turned out to be unnecessary because there is a far more succinct definition in

a far shorter paper.

But do I regret reading the Geneva Conventions?

Of course not.

Knowledge is its own reward.

And could I really call this an Unraveled if I didn’t spend a whole day reading 224

pages of dense legalese for no good reason?

Of course I couldn’t.

Of course I couldn’t…

If Bowser wants to keep his armed conflict above board, we need to codify his aggressions.

So this means his henchmen need to follow a command structure.

One that is not at all clear cut in the games.

All we need is a list of Bowser’s troops.

That’s where this book comes in!

It’s The Super Mario Bros. Encyclopedia.

The official listing of everything you could ever want to know about the 17 games in the

main series of Super Mario Bros.

The main series are just the platformers, none of the RPGs or spin offs.

But the silver lining to this means that I can spend a different Unraveled talking about those games.

Because God has cursed me for my hubris, and my work is never finished.

Of the 17 in the main series, I’m gonna cut these three games, because they don’t

have Bowser as the main antagonist.

And I’m also gonna include Super Mario Odyssey, because that came out after this book was published.

That leaves us with 15 games and 226 enemies.

I came to this number because I cut out the variants.

I cut out all of the shadow versions of Mario, the minigame enemies, the enemies that are

just machines, and Bowser’s fursonas.

Because those should never be exposed to the horrors of war.

Now I need to figure out how to structure this hierarchy.

I asked myself, is there an analogous military that is somewhat bloated, often antagonistic,

and seems to be the only thing that the leadership cares about funding?

Unfortunately, I couldn’t find any real life examples of this.

So I’m loosely basing it on the US military.

That means Bowser’s military **SMACK*** will be split up into branches based on which

henchmen work best together, and I’m also going to try to fit them alongside commissioned

officers and enlisted troops.

The standard command structure that’s found in most militaries.

Let’s start with the heads of state: Obviously, we have Bowser up at the top, the commander in chief.

His secretary of defense is gonna be Kamek,

with Kamella standing by as the National Security Council.

We’ve also got Bowser Jr. up here, but he’s not in a military role.

He’s actually Secretary of Transportation.

But that’s just pure nepotism.

The rest of Bowser’s henchmen are going to fit into this hierarchy, and I’m just

gonna say one henchman per rank, the one that epitomizes what that rank means.

And I’m gonna list the rest of the enemies on the screen.

Because I do want to save at least a little bit of paper.

Uh.

Obviously I don’t want to save paper that much.

*paper guilt*

Starting with our infantry, we have our enlisted ranks with Private Goomba.

This makes sense.

It is the basic troop.

Moving up a step to the corporal, we’ve got the Galoomba.

It’s more mature than the Goomba.

And also, its name has an extra syllable and is way more fun to yell.

Pat: Look at this Galoomba!

Brian: LOOK AT THIS GALOOMBA!

Chargin’ Chuck is a great pick for sergeant class, because this troop obviously enlisted

right after being their high school star quarterback and moved up through the ranks quickly.

And now that we’re up at warrant officer, the top of the enlisted ranks.

We’ve got, it’s just a tower of Goombas.

Kind of like the Naval Academy’s Herndon Monument, Goombas become stronger and work

together better when they’re standing on top of one another.

Moving our way up to the commissioned officers, we start out with officer cadet.

And that’s gonna be Twirlip.

It’s got the round, soft body of a day one ROTC recruit,

but there’s ambition in those eyes.

Second lieutenant, we’ve got the Snailicorn.

It’s the natural evolution from the officer cadet, but a bit more dangerous.

By the time you’ve reached First Lieutenant, you’ve really proved your mettle and are

ready to show your dedication to the cause.

And what better way to show your dedication than to be literally shot from a cannon.

By the time you reach captain, you need to have a top-down perspective.

And that's why the Pokey's height is great for this rank.

Also, the Pokey understands how to take calculated losses in stride, like having literally all

of their torso punched out from under them and still maintaining a smile.

Next we have Major Squizzard, and I’m gonna gloss over him, 'cause his name makes me uncomfortable.

For lieutenant colonel, I chose Wiggler, because they're able to maintain composure and only

release their aggression when it's absolutely necessary.

But quick shout out to Stairface Ogre, who is also a lieutenant colonel and sounds like

he could be a member of the Wu Tang Clan.

Next, we have Colonel Spike.

At the colonel rank, you’re not only dealing with wartime issues, but also the internal

politics of the military,

which is why Spike makes time to have a few rounds of tennis with the boss.

A Brigadier General needs an eye for detail and a strong guiding hand.

And that's literally all Knucklotec is.

Major Burrows really deserves the rank of major general because he has demonstrated

a powerful understanding of many strategies in many different battle arenas.

But more than that, he has this tender leadership quality that makes him not only respected,

but loved by his peers.

And then above him is a fucking T-Rex.

Unfortunately, even the military hierarchy is not insulated from nepotism.

And though no one would describe Petey Piranha as capable in literally any circumstance,

his father took a bullet for Bowser back in the Korean War, so now he’s a general.

And finally, we have our field marshall, the five-star general.

Obviously, this person is going to oversee every aspect of Bowser's infantry, and it

has to be filled with the most overpowered troop.

So it's Ukiki.

This shitheel of a monkey plays dumb, but he’s the Sun Tzu of Bowser’s army.

Listen to these quotes:

And that is the basic structure of Bowser’s infantry, though there are also three special

divisions of infantry units that are trained to fight in different conditions.

The Lava and the Ice divisions are still found under Field Marshal Ukiki and they don't have

any enlisted troops.

I won't talk too much about these two, but I think they are epitomized by the Bully for

the Lava group, and the Chill Bully for the ice group, who is exactly like the Bully,

except he'll kind of go easy on you if he can tell you're having a rough day.

And the third special unit in the infantry is the spectral unit, or the Dry Corps, because

not even death can excuse you from service in Bowser's army.

I do want to talk about the implications of this unit for a moment.

Specifically Dry Bones and Dry Bowser, whose naming conventions confuse and frighten me.

When I die, will I become Dry Brian?

Is a living Bowser...

Wet Bowser?

Why do Piranha Plant have bone in it?

Next we have our aquatic troops.

Where can you find pleasure, search the world for treasure, learn science technology?

Um.

Where can you begin to make your dreams all come true, on the land or on the sea?

*SINGING* IN THE NAVY!

I won’t overstay my welcome on the naval forces because we already understand what

each of the ranks in the hierarchy entail.

But I did just want to point out one troop.

The Gushen.

Because its name is the Gushen.

And I had to learn that its name was the Gushen.

And now you need to know that it's called a Gushen as well.

And of course, the admiral of the fleet is going to be Unagi.

Because Unagi is the most terrifying character ever rendered.

Get fucked, Mr. X.

Now on to the Air Force, we start with the Paragoomba at our lowest rank.

And honestly, we're gonna skip ahead to wing commander, because most of the Air Force is

just infantry but with wings attached.

Lakitu is our wing commander.

You might remember him as that helpful guy who picks you up in Mario Kart.

But he actually got his start in carpet bombing.

And it might seem redundant to have Klepto as the marshal of the Air Force.

But if there's one strategy that Bowser's military understands better than anything else,

it's stealing hats.

And these are the branches of Bowser’s military.

Of course, there are also Special Forces.

Units that Bowser can send in when he needs something to be done quietly and cleanly.

Like when the he sent the Broodals to perform the extrajudicial killing of Professor E. Gadd.

Next we've got the Bros.

I'm talking the Hammer Bro, the Fire Bro, every bro in between.

You can learn more about them in the HBO series, Band of Brothers.

I assume.

I've never watched the show.

It’s time for the special forces called The Funny Parade!

It’s the Funny Parade!

You know about Thwomps, but did you know that there are Thwimps?

And the Whomps have Whimps?

Thwimps and Thwomps and Whimps and Whomps and Grindels and Spindels and Grrrols.

There's Tox Box and Flomps and Rhomps and Bomps and Walleyes and Wallops and

they're all pretty much invincible and they will crush you without hesitation

like a cartoonish Sherman’s March to the Sea.

Next, we've got the Koopalings.

They're sort of like the Seal Team 6 of Bowser's army.

Iggy, Larry, Lemmy, Roy, Wendy O., Ludwig Von.

Notice that I did not include Morton Koopa Jr., because despite what he has written in

his memoirs, he's never actually been active duty, and he’s a valor stealing bastard.

And the final special forces team.

It’s the Stus.

Strollin’ Stu (strollin' stu).

Soarin’ Stu (soarin' stu).

Swipin' Stu (swipin' stu).

Smolderin’ Stu (smolderin' stu).

*Pat laughs offscreen.*

I don’t know if they’re good at fighting

but they are good at being the best fucking characters in Mario.

And that is every troop in Bowser’s military.

Except for these six specific ones.

They didn't really fit in the military structure.

They don't act like military.

The Koopa Troopas from Super Mario 64, they don’t even antagonize you.

Like, they go about their business unless you go out of your way to attack them.

So, again, they don't even, like, feel like military.

Uh, they act more like civilians, to be honest.

*realizing an unfortunate truth*

Oh my god, they’re civilians.

Okay, so maybe reading the full Geneva Conventions wasn’t such an unnecessary thing after all.

There’s this thing called the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, and in

Article 8 Subsection 2, it states that grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions

count as war crimes.

And if these Koopa Troopas are in fact not Troopas, but civilians, and Mario kills them,

then that is a direct violation of Article 8 Part 2, subsection B, 1: (i) Intentionally

directing attacks at the civilian population...

Mario is a war criminal.

But that’s not the only breach, God no.

Subsection A 4: Extensive destruction and appropriation of property.

Destroying a brick to gain a coin.

Subsection A 5, Compelling a prisoner of war... to serve in the forces of a hostile Power.

What else could you call using Cappy to possess enemies

and then forcing them to fire on their own friends?

Subsection A 8, Taking of hostages.

What was Mario doing with that penguin child?

You might think, hey, maybe Mario's just become hardened after years of onslaught

by Bowser, but LOOK BACK TO MARIO’S YOUTH!

I know I didn’t include Yoshi’s Island in these lists of games, but Subsection B, 21:

Committing outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment.

Yoshi made Burt the Bashful’s pants fall down!

But Baby Mario gave the order.

He already feels bashful!

You didn't need to pants the man!

Mario has committed at least 5 war crimes,

and I’m not even including the child soldiers he has enlisted in the RPGs.

But luckily, I’ve already compiled an extensive PDF that I have just emailed to the Hague,

outlining Mario's crimes.

Still, it’s important to note that Bowser is also at fault.

The great loss of Goomba life is a tragedy, no matter which side you are on.

The true enemy is war itself.

And to fix that, we have to turn to the only thing that’s worked in the past.

Song.

One more time everyone!

We are the Toads.

We are the goombas.

So please stop jumping on each other, ya big Galoombas!

Why do we fight to take each others’ space, when there’s so mushroom to spare.

We could all have extra lives if we just share. 
 2020-06-25 16:22:25,584 - DEBUG - file running:  CASTLEVANIA!

One of my favorite game series of all time.

The myriad enemies you face in Dracula’s abode are made even better knowing that they

come from real mythology and folklore.

Wouldn’t it be nice if there was one place you could find the FULL BESTIARY of EVERY

MONSTER in Castlevania?

I think that would be nice.

OR AT LEAST I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE.

I swear to god, the first time I started filming this video, I thought it would be an easy

change of pace.

I mean, how many unique enemies could there really be in Castlevania?

100?

200?

How about more than 600.

So I booked 3 hours in this studio to film.

And then we ran out of time about halfway through.

So I went out to grab some lunch, but it start to rain, so I ate a chicken sandwich drenched.

That has nothing to do with the video, I just wanted you to know my pain.

So I had to start filming all over again, this time after hours in a random meeting

room in our office building.

And when I finished that, I had three and a half hours of footage that I was able to

whittle down into an hour long video that was very educational and extremely entertaining.

JUST KIDDING.

IT WAS BORING AS HELL.

But just when all hope seemed lost, I had an epiphany.

“I am going to throw myself into the sea.”

Luckily, before I could do that, my coworkers stopped me and convinced me that trying to

categorize all 600 Castlevania monsters was a bad idea, and instead, I could just pick the hot one.

Ask yourself, why are vampires always the hot monster?

Isn’t it someone else’s turn?

I’m here to answer that question now that I’m filming this video for the third time.

Be thankful that I’m not releasing an hour long video of me basically just lecturing

you on mythology.

I mean, who knows, maybe I’ll release that video some other time.

THAT WAS A JOKE.

I’M NOT GONNA DO THAT.

YOU’RE GONNA HAVE TO TRUST ME.

IT WAS A REALLY BAD VIDEO.

SO LET’S FIND CASTLEVANIA’S MOST ELIGIBLE BACHELOR!

*hot music*

*lonely squeaking*

Let’s cull down that list of over 600 enemies.

We’re gonna start by smooshing all of the ones with common mythologies into just one

enemy, so that way we don’t have to deal with the 96 different skeletons.

We're also going to go ahead and cut out the evil human beings, and that includes the Belmonts that

you fight as enemies, and also all of the vampires.

We all know that Dracula is hot.

We all know that Richter Belmont is hot.

I’m also going to go ahead and cut all of the enemies from Boku Dracula Kun, which was

just a spinoff series, and Getsu Fuma Den enemies, which only appeared in one stage

in Castlevania Harmony of Despair.

And now it’s time to cut the animals, mythical or otherwise.

Look, if they’re anthropomorphized sure, but for things like “Owl,” that’s not

a monster, that’s a bird.

What about ephemera like will o’ the wisps, or inanimate objects made animate, kind of

like golems or marionettes.

I went back and forth on whether or not to include these, and then I realized they creep

me out, so I cut them.

Now I’m going to cut out all of the gods and the god servants and the embodiments of

things like chaos and evil, because those are inherently unique.

I'm gonna cull this list a little bit more, because, let’s be honest, vampires aren’t the only monsters

that have had a taste *kiss* of that sexy limelight.

Witches and warlocks, zombie, orc, treant, werewolf, mermen, gargoyle, gremlin, ghosts,

Medusa, cyclops, yeti, fox archer, ogres, stained glass knight, from Young Sherlock

Holmes, where he appeared as the first photorealistic CGI in any movie back in 1985.

And finally, mummies, Brendan Fraser.

Wasn’t the mummy in the film, but he’s sexy enough that just by association.

But we’ve culled it down to the perfect number to figure out our sexy monster.

That’s right.

We’ve got 69 left.

Can I get a WOOP?

Patrick: Woo!

Clayton: woo.

We’ll work on it, Clayton.

Criteria for what makes a sexy monster: Number one, is it replicable.

I’ve already explained this, it can’t be a unique monster.

Anything unique can be sexy.

Look at Benedict Cumberbatch.

Number two, is it datable?

Can you have a conversation with this monster?

Can you bring it to Applebee’s?

And number three, can this monster…

GET IT?

We're gonna start with the viable ones that probably aren’t the best sex icons, like Mimic, which

is kind of a veiny blob.

The Two Headed Creature.

Part cyclops, part werewolf, all bad.

Wight, W.I.G.H.T.

comes from the old English term meaning human being.

It’s like a… just a blue zombie.

Necromancers…

I don’t know, they’re into weird shit.

Spriggans come from Cornish faery lore, and they are described as old, wizened men with

huge childlike heads, uh, which someone’s into, I’m sure.

Nominon is a beast that, like, sucks the dreams out of your brains.

And that’s not a very supportive partner.

Punaguchi is just a large protruding mouth.

I don’t want to know what that mouth do.

The Maneating Plant, the Wakwak Tree, and the Human Face Tree are all plants.

So if you would want to make the monster sexy, it would just… it’s just a plant.

The rug creature.

Uh, you never actually see what it is, it’s just always under the rug.

Which means it’s probably just like a cat.

Hearteater.

If you’re into bad boys.

Castlevania has some of the best design in any pixel art game, except for the Towers Guardian.

I don’t know what the hell this is.

A ghoul isn’t necessarily a zombie, it is something that eats corpses, which is just gross.

This one’s for the sapiosexuals out there… the Brain Float.

Alastor: you should be wary of anyone who builds their personality around swords.

Elementals are just embodiments of fire and frost.

Just hard to cuddle with.

The Legend of Zeldo.

It’s just a person with scythes.

They are also known by the name “the Night Stalker,” which is a big red flag.

The Kyoma Demon hangs out in mirrors and jumps out and scares you, uh, and I don’t need

anymore reason to be afraid of looking at myself in the mirror.

*pensive music*

Man Beast comes in two forms: twink and twunk.

They say that eye contact is important.

But maybe not this much.

I do think we need a sexy skeleton, and the epitome of skeleton in this game is Yorick.

Yorick comes from Hamlet, the famous soliloquy “Alas, poor Yorick.”

In the Japanese version, he isn’t called Yorick, he’s called Soccer Boy.

The Imp is a mischievous sprite.

And I was a bit worried about size differentials, but then I remembered Bee Movie, where a human

woman falls in love with a bee.

Jerry Seinfeld taught me that through love all things are possible.

Trolls.

It’s time for someone to give them the love they deserve.

The next monster is Evil Force.

And I want you to just go ahead and wipe away all preconceived notions.

Obviously, the name makes it sound bad.

Uh.

It also is terrible.

(Pat laughs off camera).

Edimmu are Mesopotamian demons that come back from the dead when they weren’t buried correctly,

which seems like super high maintenance.

The Slaughterer apparently skips leg day.

The Arthroverta.

Just a human face plastered on top of, like, an arthropod. I dunno, maybe?

Chon Chon, or the Bitterfly, comes from Chile.

It’s about Mapuche wizards that turn into this thing.

Kind of like vampires turning into bats.

It’s a neat talent.

*revealing my true Chon Chon form*

The Killer Mantle.

Comes from an urban legend in Japan about Aka Manto, which is a spirit that lives in

toilets and then asks you if you want red or blue toilet paper.

Red, they’ll stab you in the back a bunch, and blue, they’ll strangle you till you

turn blue.

I’m just not into toilet stuff.

I mean most of these monsters are pretty okay.

Um, they’re not the… they’re not like the most.

SURPRISE!

I LULLED YOU INTO A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY!

It’s time for a minigame I like to call, “If I were a Castlevania game... what title

would I be?”

Take your birth month, and that’s the first part of the title.

OF.

And your birth date is the second part.

My title would be Castlevania: Sonata of the Eclipse.

All of these games sound the same.

We’re halfway through the viable enemies.

We’ve got 35 monsters that I think are pretty good options.

We’re gonna start with the monsters that are supposed to be sexy, so it feels kind

of unfair to use them as the sexy monsters.

Lorelai, Lilith, and all of the succubi, Harpys, Headhunter, Arachnes, Dryads, Rusalka, and Naiads.

I’m just putting these ones all around the sides.

The demons.

The ones with the horns and the wings and they’re really ripped and muscular.

Mothman.

Everyone thinks the Mothman is pretty sexy.

Although this Jersey Devil depiction looks just kind of like a horse with wings, uh,

the actual Jersey Devil comes from an idea of a woman who cursed her 13th child, being like,

“UGH GOD I GOTTA HAVE ANOTHER BABY.”

And then it came out and it grew like a goat’s face and wings, and I just think we need to

start thinking of New Jersey in general as sexier.

And this might be the way to do that.

The Minotaur.

You gotta work through that labyrinth, but once you get in there and find the real Minotaur,

he might kill you.

But, he also might open up and be really lovely.

The Chupacabra is an impish little fella.

First sighted in Puerto Rico and is known throughout lots of Latin America.

His name translates to goat sucker.

Do I have to explain why...

The Fomorians are personifications of chaos and other evil ideas in Irish folklore.

Um, and they're these goat people, uh, and they're ripped as hell.

Lizard Man.

If you don't know why I'm putting this here.

*COME ON*

You gotta go what my Skyrim video.

Banshee comes from Irish folklore and will foretell the death of someone you know.

It's a bit spooky.

It's also super emotionally available.

You won't have to worry about what the Banshee is thinking.

They will tell you when they're upset.

And also when your parents are gonna die.

Slogra.

Doesn't have a folklore or mythology associated with it.

I got nothing for ya.

If you're not attracted to this, you're wrong.

Because the Rycuda only exists in Castlevania, it means that there's... very specific artwork

that you can find of it.

Very modern artwork has been made about the Rycuda, which proves it can be sexy.

Dullahan is an Irish faery that is like a headless horseman sort of character, it's

also another portent of death, but can you think about all the cool Spider-Man kisses

you can do with that?

The Jiang Shi is the Qing dynasty version of a vampire.

Keremet comes out when you bang on his pot a couple times.

It's a good face, right?

I could talk to that thing for hours.

There are so many armors in Castlevania.

No one can turn down a man in uniform.

Or a poltergeist in uniform.

Or literally just an enchanted uniform.

UGHHHHHHH MOTHER OF PEARL I forgot about goblins.

Everyone forgets about goblins though, so I'll put 'em over here!

I also forgot about Siren, that's another thing that's sexy and draws people in.

How did I skip so many of these?

The Guillotiner doesn't look like much, could be a problem, but it's time for us to bring it back.

Slime.

There are already things online.

The Tsuchinoko is a Japanese cryptid that is a snake that is fatter in its middle than

on its head or its tail.

Pat (off camera): I just don't see why it's sexy.

You don't...

Patrick, you gotta understand.

It's not about what you could first see, right?

Pat: I mean, but even after that, what do you see after that?

It has a propensity for lying and for drinking alcohol.

Patrick thinks it shouldn't be this high on the list, but fuck Patrick.

We're at the top five.

But before we get there, um, I have a confession to make.

I've kept six monsters that don't even fit my criteria, but I love them so much that

I think they deserve a chance.

First up is a unique character, it's Nergal Meslamstea.

The reason I think he deserves a chance is because is because someone named him Nergal

Meslamstea.

Of course he's gonna be fucking evil if you name your child...

Why, what is up with people in Castlevania naming their children dumb shit?

Seriously, Alucard?

Dracula, you can't just name your child your name backwards.

I'm not gonna name my son Nairb.

Scary Candle.

It's an inanimate object that is made animate, but I fucking love candles.

Next two I think are pretty self explanatory: Bone Pillar.

And if that doesn't make you happy, how 'bout the Bone Dragon?

This next one is a ghost, and I've already explained why that one shouldn't be included

in this, but I had to because the ghost's name is Duke Mirage.

And if someone comes up to me and introduces themself to me as Duke Mirage,

my pants are already off.

Finally, I know I nixed all animals.

But I really do think we should include Hyena with gun.

That hyena can GET IT.

We're at the top five.

The Malebranche come from Dante's Divine Comedy.

They're all unique demons that are used to help keep corrupt politicians under boiling

pits of tar in Hell.

They all have great names like Cagnazzo and Scarmiglione, which was translated into the

English version as Skull Millione, which is just a Soundcloud rapper.

They're already mischievous, and they hate corrupt politicians.

We can get behind that.

The Myconid is a sentient race of mushroom people.

We have anthropomorphized animalia, why not anthropomorphized fungi?

When I was a kid, my mom thought that I had a nutritional deficit because I kept wanting

to eat mushrooms so much, like I ate only mushrooms for like a whole week.

That has nothing to do with this.

I know I took out all of the werewolf creatures, uh, but this one isn't that.

This is the Princess of Moss.

The human version is based off of

PFBRRRRRRRR UHM OFF WITH THE-ERRR Let them eat cake?

(Pat: Mary Antoinette) Mary Antoinette.

I think we should have more moth creatures in our movies.

Right?

They're already drawn towards the limelight.

It's an Ukoback.

Why is this the second sexiest monster from Castlevania?

I'll tell you why.

He carries around a hot thing of coals in a spoon, and is also responsible not only

for fried foods, but fireworks.

HELL YES.

What a cool dude!

I think Ukobacks could be real sexy, right?

What is more sexy than feeding someone with a lovely fried dish?

And finally, the thing that I think should be new sexy monster.

The Mandrake.

Or the Alura Une.

Basically, any sort of plant person.

Alura Une actually comes from a 1911 book called "Alraune."

It's a German story.

I just think that this kind of gives you a blank slate on something, sure this, this

thing is born from the ground where hanged men bleed, which is spooky, and scary, but

it's not their fault!

Right?

You know, they didn't choose to be born.

Who does choose to be born?

Right?

Who chooses...

The metaphors of how our family raises us, you know, the mandrake is a perfect idea of

something that can become greater than its original circumstances.

*SIGH* So there you go.

The full bestiary of the sexy monsters.

Again, couldn't give you the full full bestiary, because that took me way too long.

And if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw myself into the ocean now.

I CAN'T DO THAT.

I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE COLD BUT I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS GOING TO BE THAT COLD.

Make sure to like this video and subscribe to Polygon if you want to see more Unraveled,

and go ahead and leave a comment of your new Castlevania title.

Maybe that'll convince them to make a new game. 
 2020-06-25 16:22:25,585 - DEBUG - file running:  Welcome to Unraveled Season 2!

You can tell it’s a new season because I’ve grown a mustache and cut my hair.

Ohoho I’m obviously just kidding.

These are both fake.

I know how much it would disappoint my friends if I changed my appearance.

I'm just kidding again.

I'm not your friend, and you have no say over what I do with my body.

And speaking of harsh realities...

The world of Dark Souls is frightening and murky.

How can you truly understand Dark Souls lore without living Dark Souls?

Grinding away tirelessly in inhospitable environments, under uncharitable overlords.

To truly understand Dark Souls lore, you must first understand the desolation of…

Working at a job!

Have you ever thought about the term Boss in a video game before?

Those terrible enemies have the same title as the people you’ll be working for

for the rest of your life!

Haha, what a silly coincidence!

Dark Souls is known for wildly difficult bosses that prove themselves on the battlefield,

but can they prove themselves in a more difficult setting:

the Lordran Hills Business Park and Commerce Center!

It’s across from the mall.

Today, I’m ranking every Dark Souls boss based on how good they’d be as a manager.

I'm not dancing this season.

Welcome to the Dark Souls Corp. onboarding seminar.

Now I'm only going to be speaking about the Dark Souls 1, 2, and 3 bosses.

No other “Soulsborne” games.

I was originally thinking about putting in the Demon's Souls, but they actually got integrated

into the Dark Corporation in a very messy merger.

All of the managers got sacked.

So we're not talking about them.

That leaves us with 96 Dark Souls bosses and minibosses.

And it leads us to the difficult part of our journey, how do we objectively answer the

subjective question: “What makes a good boss?”

So I started researching lists of “the x qualities of a good boss” on places like

LinkedIn and Forbes, and then I fell down the rabbit hole of the hundreds of corporate blogs.

And at the end of this journey, I realized... it didn't matter at all.

What does matter is making a catchy, powerpointable mnemonic device.

So here are the Five Cs that make a good boss:

Number one, clear vision.

Can this boss communicate their goals, give clear steps on how to achieve those goals.

Does this boss clearly hold their big old arm way up in the air before slamming it down on you?

Number two, consistent feedback.

It’s important for a boss to let you know that you’ve made a mistake, like challenging

Seath the Scaleless before putting on your ring of sacrifice, you absolute fool.

You child.

Number three, cherishes employees.

A good boss values employee perspectives and rewards good performance.

Like when a boss decides to die when you hit it in a good way.

Number four, compassionate leadership.

Honest. Trusting.

Worthy of respect from their employees.

The kind of boss you could chat with at the Estus cooler.

And the fifth and final C. Can really just go to town on a motherfucker.

Slices.

Dices.

Big old crunchers.

Someone who’s willing to do what needs to be done when the going gets tough.

Or someone who reveals an abyssal dragon that they’ve been keeping under their armor this whole time.

This is our main criteria for what makes a good boss.

But for 96 bosses, it's gonna be hard to differentiate their management style with just these five Cs.

Which is why I’m introducing the HR index.

If they're over here, they get a lot of HR compliments.

If they're down here, they get a lot of HR complaints.

Let’s be honest, some really well-loved bosses are very bad leaders, and some really good leaders

are SKEEZY AS HELL.

So let's rank some DARK SOULS BOOOOOSSEEEEEEEEES.

Here's our scale.

We're gonna start out with the neutrals.

They're the standard boss, so I'm just gonna skim through them.

Guardian Dragon, The Pursuer, Old Demon King, Demon of Song.

If you're watching this video and you see yourself exhibiting these lackluster tendencies,

I want you to ask yourself: What can I do to be better than the Royal Rat Authority,

who vomits acid all over the floor multiple times a day and is still considered a pretty

okay boss.

Aim higher.

Let's talk about the pushovers!

Now, these are like my favorite substitute teacher in high school, Mr. S,

who would go off on class-long tangents about his youth traveling the world

instead of teaching us about Lord of the Flies.

I loved Mr. S.

Objectively a terrible teacher, though.

Champion's Gravetender and Gravetender Greatwolf.

This guy’s so fun!

He brought his dog into work!

I love dogs!

Literally nothing's going to get done today.

Vordt of the Boreal Valley.

He runs around on all fours.

He's really disrupting the “walking” space.

It’s very ineffective.

Iron Golem.

He’s sweet, sort of bumbling, and you’ve asked him to approve your expense reports

like five times already.

Aava, Lud, and Zallen, the King's Pets.

Literally baked into the title, they're teacher's pets.

They suck up to the king.

Seath the Scaleless is a real sweetheart, but he is very risk averse.

And if you destroy his crystal, he becomes mortal, and takes it, like, really personally.

The Fume Knight.

He’s got two sides, two swords.

Look, he's still got his old sword back when he had your job.

But eventually he is gonna get rid of that sword.

He's gonna be a real asshole about it.

The Lost Sinner.

She, and I quote, “eternally punishes herself for the sins of her past.”

It’s important to have a boss that recognizes their flaws, but it's bad if your boss locks

herself in the conference room and flogs herself eternally.

I booked the conference room for three, I need to get in there.

Crossbreed Priscilla goes invisible at the first sign of conflict.

That's not showing up for the company.

Lorian and Lothric the princes.

One of them hangs around the other one's neck of the other one, who's actually doing all the work.

Which is the worst form of micromanaging.

The Four Kings.

You don't fight all four at once.

You fight one and then the rest come in slowly.

Which is kind of like every group project you had in high school.

The Carthus Sand Worm.

If you ignore them, they'll ignore you, and some people like that managing style.

But also if you stand on the sideline for long enough, someone else will shoot big arrows

into them and then they'll die.

And that's a bad boss.

The Dragonslayer Armour is actually just a puppet for these big wiry dragon butterfly things.

So they're well-loved by the higher ups, but only because they don't have any ideas on their own.

The Ancient Wyvern is the epitome of pushover.

Because you can just run through his stage and then kill him with one attack at the very end.

This is perfect for the employee that likes to, you know, fuck around on Reddit all day

and then send one email at five and then peace out.

I don't know what that's like.

I've never done that.

And finally, this is sort of a technical pushover.

It's the Ruin Sentinels.

They're kind of like a board of directors in that they all look the same and do the

same thing, which is to say not a lot.

But you gotta suck up to them if you want to get anywhere in the company.

Now we're gonna flip to the opposite side of the scale.

We're gonna talk about the sketchies.

These have a powerful understanding of corporate leadership...

but everyone hates them.

The Boreal Outrider Knight is a miniboss, but like, you can tell he really wants to be a boss.

Nashandra tricks you into opening the Throne of Want even though she just wants it for herself.

But manipulation gets you pretty far in business.

The Burnt Ivory King only comes to fight you after you kill literally all of his knights.

He gets it done, sure, but only when he needs to.

Dragonrider.

This dude doesn't have a dragon.

His job title is obviously false.

It's like if I got promoted to "Guy who had an okay time in high school."

Bed of Chaos.

Actually a very effective leader, but every time you have to have

a "Meeting with the Bed of Chaos,"

someone in HR gets an email.

Centipede Demon.

He nasty.

Manus, the Father of the Abyss.

Always screaming at me.

Bad anger management.

High Lord Wolnir has a lot of gold jewelry.

Very ostentatious.

All of his plans sound more like schemes,

BUT!

He does know the bassist for Maroon 5 and they've been looking for someone with like

really good hand dexterity and he's noticed that you've got something good so if you want...

Mytha, the Baneful Queen doesn't really have an understanding of personal boundaries.

She's kind of like that coworker who, instead of sending an email,

just peeks their head over the cubicle wall.

Except in this case that head is severed from the body and will explode.

Pinwheel can summon an unlimited amount of clones.

Most bosses wish they could be everywhere at once.

This one can be.

Slave Knight Gael came into the company with you, was a really good friend, and then he

got promoted over you, and he's been a real jerk since.

Aldia, Scholar of the First Sin is constantly testing you, because he sees great things in you.

But dude, not everything has to be a test.

This is a Game Stop.

Aldrich, Devourer of Gods has a bunch of skeletons strewn about his clothes, and those are the

people he ate on his way to the top.

Which is incredibly cutthroat, but at least he’s honest about it.

Pontiff Sulyvahn has two swords: a profane flame and a sword of judgment.

And he hits you with both of them.

He's the type of guy who sends you an NSFW link at work

and then reports you for clicking on it.

Dragon Slayer Ornstein and Executioner Smough get shit DONE.

They are a power couple...

that isn't sanctioned by HR.

They didn't fill out the paperwork.

It makes everyone very uncomfortable.

There is a LOT of PDA.

And it is weird.

Now let's move on to the good category, with the Old Dragonsl...

THIS IS JUST ORNSTEIN AGAIN.

THIS DUDE JUST PUT ON A DIFFERENT SUIT AND TRIED TO GET REHIRED IN THE OGDEN BRANCH.

That's not gonna fly!

Y’all ready for the stinkers?

You thought we had some pretty bad bosses up to this point, but we haven't even hit

the depths of bad bossery.

We're about to hit the Blighttown of HR.

Vendrick.

Dude, you gotta wear more than a loincloth to work.

Chaos Witch Quelaag and Scorpioness Najka are nude from the waist up...

and nude from the waist down.

Y'all, we have leftover shirts from the softball game, can you just go into the bathroom and

put one of those on, please?

Old Iron King is constantly working from home and he signs all of his emails,

"Sent from my hot tub."

GET OUT OF THE HOT TUB!

Ceaseless Discharge.

The name alone tells me you should have taken a sick day.

Oceiros, the Consumed King is always going on about his son Ocelotte,

showing you pictures of him and his rowing team.

You KNOW that this psych major is gonna replace you as soon as he graduates Yale.

Asylum Demon, Stray Demon, Demon Firesage all have a move called butt slam.

*camera nods in agreement*

Looking Glass Knight.

Reflects everyone's flaws back on them, doesn't look inward enough.

Curse-rotted Greatwood.

Another dress code violation.

Gwyn, Lord of Cinder is kept around because he was the founder and made a lot of money

on Wall Street in the '80s, but he’s hollow inside.

The Covetous Demon is always taking credit for the work that you're doing.

And he steals your lunch from the fridge every day, even though I label it, DAVE.

Abyss Watchers.

Infighting is a very dangerous thing for a group of managers.

The Crystal Sage does a little bit of work, and then vanishes, and then does a little bit more work,

and then vanishes, and then you see them on their instagram story at some beer garden.

Sister Friede is actually a very good boss, and should be up here, but unfortunately

she's the assistant to Father Ariandel

who is SO incompetent he can't untie a chair from his ass.

And finally, the worst boss...

The Gaping Dragon.

Under no circumstances should you be in a work setting

and described as gaping.

All that's left is the top right of this scale, the good bosses, but before we get there,

there are a few bosses that don't really fit into the standard "boss/employee" structure,

or they're basically corporations in their own right, so we'll talk about them as alternatives.

The Bell and the Belfry Gargoyles only come in when someone else is hurting.

So they're kind of like consultants.

Halflight, Spear of the Church could actually be a real-life human player.

And pitting employees against each other is a big no-no.

The Royal Rat Vanguard is one boss rat that's surrounded by a horde of indistinguishable other rats,

so it's just an episode of Undercover Boss.

Afflicted Graverobber, Ancient Soldier Varg, and Cerah the Old Explorer are a trio that...

like, they're just high school friends that decided to get together and open a burger joint,

and they're kind of incompetent but you love them anyway.

The Prowling Magus and Congregation is a startup because it's one charismatic weirdo who takes

credit for all of the hardworking people around them.

We've got some unions!

A good union would be the Skeleton Lords.

It's three lords and a bunch of minions who are recognized and working together toward

the same goal.

That's a good thing.

A worse union is the Deacons of the Deep, where the management only comes in

after five of their employees are killed.

Finally, we have the Executioner's Chariot, whose employees are trying to unionize,

but they keep getting trampled.

And that leaves us with the good ones.

There are only 13 of them.

The Flexile Sentry.

Great multitasker.

The Taurus Demon gives you the tools you need to succeed, and encourages you to climb that ladder,

so that way you can jump down and hit him on the head.

Gravelord Nito has a lot of skeleton friends.

A very good delegator.

The Duke's Dear Freja.

Yeah, she's a big spider...

but she's the Duke's DEAR Freja!

The Duke loves her!

When has the Duke led you astray before?

Come on, man!

The Duke loves her!

Give her a chance!

Pat (offscreen): Do it for the Duke!

Do it for the Duke!

Sinh, the Slumbering Dragon and the Last Giant are slow, deliberate, and they keep on going

even though they got a big fucking spear through 'em.

Elana, the Squalid Queen summons friends when things get a bit too much for her.

That’s good delegation and understanding your limits.

The Ancient Dragon doesn't actually fight you until you fight them, you can just have

a chat with this boss, and honestly, that's good enough sometimes.

Great Grey Wolf Sif is a big wolf with a sword.

FUCK YEAH!

The Nameless King and the King of the Storm.

Now, when the King of the Storm takes enough damage,

the Nameless King will put them out of their misery.

And it's very sad, but it's also what needed to be happen.

That's good management.

I fully expect my boss, Tara Long, to put me out of my misery when I stop being useful.

The Soul of Cinder.

If you kill him, you might become him.

And that's a very clear path to promotion.

It’s not a great path to promotion, but it is a clear one.

The Throne Watcher and Defender are another power couple, but they filled out the HR paperwork.

And they work great together!

They're super professional about it.

They constantly revive the other one when they die, and that's a good boss.

Also, relationship goals.

And finally, the best business boss in Dark Souls...

is The Rotten.

Because this company is employee owned.

Every movement is made by the collective.

Everyone gets a say.

Now you might think you are small, and insignificant,

and also dead.

But!

When you smash together everyone’s stinky, rotting corpse, you can move mountains together.

The best boss is you.

And all of your dead friends.

And in the Dark Souls Corporation, that means you need a job description.

So go ahead and use this handy chart to figure out your Dark Souls boss title.

And that concludes our onboarding seminar.

Make sure to print out your completion certificate at the end of this video

so you can send it to your manager.

Happy managing, and praise the sun!

Under no circumstances should you be in a work setting and described as gaping.

Pat (offscreen): Hey, yo, can I gape in here?

Brian (offscreen, laughing): You guys mind if I gape?

And that concludes our onboarding seminar.

Make sure to celebroderadfjoisfjid.

 2020-06-25 16:22:25,585 - DEBUG - file running:  E3.

The Electronic Entertainment Expo.

What began as a humble video game industry trade show has blossomed into something more

spectacular.

More flamboyant.

More… of whatever this is.

E3 is a chance to show off new games and the theatrical chops of your executives.

Because that’s what E3 really is now.

It’s theater.

It’s like Cats the musical but with more guns and a better plot line.

But this E3 is different.

A lot of companies are ditching the press conference altogether, and those companies

are cowards.

Sony isn’t even showing up to E3 this year!

And it’s not because they lack things to say.

It’s because they have forgotten how to say it.

The industry has lost its way.

That’s why I’ll be giving them the 10 keys to creating a perfect E3 presentation,

and then I’ll be giving you the perfect E3 presentation.

It’s theatre, baby!

The first step is throwing away everything you know about public speaking, because E3

presentations are a beast of their own.

You have to watch them to learn from them.

You might ask, "Brian, wouldn’t learning from old E3s keep you in the rut of old thinking,

making the same mistakes that past business geniuses have made?"

No.

And that brings us to the board.

I have watched hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours of E3

presentations and I have analyzed what makes them compelling.

I’ve distilled the essence of E3 down into 10 simple keys.

If you include these 10 keys, you will create the perfect E3 presentation.

And if you, like most people, aren’t putting on an E3 press conference, then you could

potentially use these 10 keys for like a drinking game or something, I’m not saying you should

do that, I’m saying it’s y… it’s possible.

You could do that if you wanted t… it’s not…

I did that, okay?

You can use these for the drinking game.

The first key: A weirdly high-budget opener.

It is essential to start the presentation with high energy, and it’s essential to

do it in such a way as to make the audience say,

“Hmm yeah wow they really paid for that, huh?”

Sony used to be great at this, starting 2016’s E3 with an entire orchestra playing the God

of War theme, and then last year they started E3 with an entire banjo player.

Weird thing to spend money on.

But both of these intros still get BONUS POINTS, because they started with a live musical number.

The second key is for the presenter.

They have the unenviable task of connecting with a notoriously difficult audience.

How can they reach the fickle gamer while still maintaining business poise?

Business Gamer Fashion.

Business Gamer Fashion is an outfit that is professional, and yet still conveys the idea

that this person could be seen sitting on a couch for 14 hours at a time.

It says, “I’m one of you…

but I’m also way richer than you.”

But the BONUS POINTS go to the one true business gamer fashion:

ill-fitting blazer,

diesel jeans,

gamer t-shirt.

The third key is set dressing.

This has to be theatrical, which is to say, inappropriate for a trade show.

Take a look at Sony’s weird barn church.

It was like an immersive theatrical experience, but with the 10-minute scene transitions of

a high school production of Les Mis.

But the BONUS POINTS go to live, human set pieces, like, I don't know, hanging bodies

from the ceiling that FLAIL AROUND when a character moves through them on the screen.

There’s that classic Sony magic!

I want to remind people that E3 is a trade show.

And this is kind of like if Disney held a press conference about the Avengers and then

DISINTEGRATED A MAN LIVE ON STAGE.

Now we’re moving into the meat and potatoes of the presentation with key number four:

Numbers.

Video Games are just programs and programs are just numbers and for some reason, gamers

love it when numbers are big.

A few good numbers to say are polygon count, amount of enemies on screen, RAM?

Maybe?

I don't know, who gives a shit!?

Honestly, BONUS POINTS go to saying a number that's completely devoid of context.

Because numbers mean…

INNOVATION.

Key number 5.

More specifically... less specifically.

I need this to be the vaguest discussion ever.

I need you to make claims about how you’re doing something that’s never been done before

and then not tell us what you're doing.

Here’s a list of innovative words and phrases.

It’s the presenter’s job to say each and every one of these.

But the BONUS POINTS go to the purest form of expressing innovation.

Looking up at the screen behind you, looking back at the audience, and saying…

“Wow.”

Key number six is the game trailer montage.

You’ve probably never heard of these games before.

You might never hear of them again, but the BONUS POINTS go to the game trailer montage

that comes at the end of the presentation, which is just showing you everything you've

seen so far set to an Arcade Fire soundalike.

These six keys are the foundation of a solid E3 presentation.

You hit these six, you’re in the clear.

But you haven’t achieved perfection yet.

But before we get into the final four, let’s talk about the notable absences.

These are anti-keys, things you’ll never see in an E3 presentation.

I got a list of them here…

Oh what’s this, it’s just a single entry that says “A legitimate discussion about

how to address the crunch crisis that's prevalent in nearly every game studio.”

Well I guess we don't need these anymore!

*wild laughter*

*frightening laughter*

*pained laughter*

*pain*

And now, it's time for the final four keys.

These are the Truly Special Moments.

They’re hard to build in, but they turn a good presentation into a transcendent one.

Key number seven: A “WHYW” game.

This is an acronym that stands for “What? Hell yeah! What!?”

and it's used for a game that makes you go,

“What?

Hell Yeah!

WHAT!?”

Often these are for games that are totally independent, but the best ones are for weird

entries into beloved franchise, like the Final Fantasy XV VR Fishing Game.

Even now, when someone tells me there’s a Final Fantasy XV VR Fishing Game, I go What? HELL YEAH! WHAT!?

But the BONUS POINTS... you know what, actually, no.

You only get bonus points if you make a VR fishing game for a beloved franchise.

I want to watch the Doomslayer catch a bass.

But sometimes, the presenter has a WHYW moment.

That’s why key eight is heartfelt emotion.

Genuine excitement about a game, joy, sadness.

This has to happen naturally.

Honestly, if I’m having a rough day, I will go back and watch the video of Ubisoft developer

Davide Soliani crying after Shigeru Miyamoto compliments him onstage, because that is the

realest and most joyful moment.

Honestly, who wouldn’t burst out crying if Shigeru Miyamoto, the architect of many

of our childhoods, complimented them?

You know, that, that tiny thing... that reminder that these people behind the games are human

beings and can be emotionally moved by the same experience that they get to share with you.

What could be better than that?

If they farted.

That's why key number nine is gaffes!

Gaffes are INTEGRAL to E3, so much so that they're split into three different categories.

The first is technical.

Gameplay going awry.

Cameras cutting back too early.

Mics not getting shut off.

The second category is human.

Awkward pauses, stiff actors, weird phrasing.

These stick in your brain forever.

Honestly, it feels like they’re planned in order to be meme-able and rememberoareble.

Mem- and memorable.

Memorable.

God, I can’t speak today…

OR CAN I?

THE THIRD CATEGORY IS PLANNED GAFFES.

I’m about to blow this whole thing wide open.

Everyone can quote at least one E3 gaffe.

Even people who don’t know who Reggie Fils Aime is have probably said “my body is ready”

at least once in their life.

And you want to know what that is?

GUERRILLA MARKETING.

The only reason there are so many gaffes in E3 presentations is to MAKE YOU SHARE THE GAFFES.

YOU MIGHT NOT REMEMBER THE GOOD PRESENTATIONS, BUT YOU SURE AS HELL LAUGHED AT THE MESSY ONES.

THE GAFFES ARE AN INSIDE JOB TO MAKE YOU BUY MORE VIDEO GAMES.

So honestly, I’m just gonna assume that all of these are planned from here on out

in order to make you talk about them online.

Except for when Todd Howard says something that's weirdly horny.

Todd: "You'll never know when you'll need a free hand."

That’s just Todd.

BONUS POINTS for horny Todd.

And the final key: The Big Finish.

This is a game announcement that falls purely into the fanservice bucket.

It is unimaginably amazing, incomprehensibly great, unbelievably too good to be true and

honestly, it's because it probably is too good to be true.

The presenter is gonna say “And one more thing,” and then they're gonna show a trailer

that’s probably a landscape shot, maybe some voiceover, and then just a title screen.

BONUS POINTS if it literally is just a title screen.

And then that game is probably gonna get stuck in development hell for 7 years and maybe

not get released ever.

But isn’t that what we want, as gamers?

To be disappointed?

And those are the 10 keys to a perfect E3 presentation.

Follow these and you can do no wrong.

And if you aren’t doing an E3 presentation, again, you could potentially use them as a

drinking game.

It's not like I wrote up all the rules already and you can click and you can play 'em along

with us since we're gonna watch all the E3 presentations.

And to prove the power of these keys, here’s my perfect E3 presentation.

Sony, go ahead and just plug your trailers into the placeholders I set up for you.

What does a gamer want?

(what does a gamer want, tell me what does a gamer want)

What does a gamer need?

(what does a gamer need, tell me what does a gamer need)

The games we make are powerful,

never been done before.

So let your inner gamer out, we’ll open up the door!

I know you’ll love these games, because I love these games, too.

And it feels the best when there’s an excited gamer inside you.

Hunter, Hunter, let me get off of the skate...

Jesus.

Hunter, get it!

Good afternoon, and welcome to Unraveled Games’ E3 press conference.

As a gamer myself, you can tell by the shirt, I’m so excited to share these fresh gaming

innovations with you all today.

But before we get to the fun part, let's talk some business.

Let me put on my blazer.

Let’s talk about how we’re changing the game… of games.

The new Unraveled Engine has allowed us to create experiences that are more detailed

than ever before.

I'm talking about 1,200 enemies onscreen concurrently, over 49 meganpixels of screen dissolution,

62 giganbotes of RAM,

and SEVEN HUNDRED and TWENTY THOUSAND…

I know it sounds like science fiction, but it’s science fact.

Why don’t we highlight a few of the games that are coming out on the Unraveled Engine.

We can go to the next slide.

Jen?

Jen, we can go to the next.

Next Gen!

First up, Unraveled Research 2.

Fans loved the experience of creating spreadsheets about video game lore, but in this immersive

sequel, you can do that with a mustache.

Wow.

And that’s not all.

We have Explaining Your Job to your Relatives Simulator, the Dark Souls of simulation games.

Experience the terror firsthand of trying to explain to your uncle that you work in

a very niche, unstable industry, but with graphics so lifelike you’ll feel like you’re

living in the world of the game.

No, Uncle Bob, I don’t make the video games, I just make videos about them.

No, they aren’t the trailers.

Terrifying.

And finally, something groundbreaking, something that seems impossible, but we did it.

I hope you come along with us on this journey of...

BDG Goes Fishing for the First Time

in VR.

*What?

Hell yeah!

What!?*

*Audience cheering*

I've got the rest of the press conference to get through, you

can quiet down, please.

But is that all we’ve got for you?

Not in the slightest.

Now it's time to show you some stuff from the company that didn't do the presentation,

and let us do all the hard work for them.

Hit it.

*Arcade Fire soundalike plays*

Wow.

You know, I, um, I'm gonna go off script a little bit.

I, uh, it just, I've...

It means so much to me to be up here on this stage in front of you.

It's been a dream since I was a kid to be presenting something at E3, and to have you

here in the audience... to, to feel the support that you've given Unraveled Games, is...

Honestly, it's, um...

I never in a million years thought that I could have-

OH JESUS, HUNTER, DON'T TRY TO...

God damnit.

Okay that’s it, uh, thank you all for coming.

Except we've got one more thing thing for you.

We’ve been working on something very special with some very special people.

From the visionary minds of David Cage and Peter Molyneux, we have teamed up with publisher

Konami to release an exclusive on Soulja Boy’s gaming console… you know what, I won’t

bore you with the business details, I’ll just let you see the trailer.

Voice over: Yeah.

I think it’s time.

*intense music plays*

*applause*

Thank you all so much for coming!

Thank you.

Have a great E3!

Hunter, get it!

*CRASH* Ha, we're good.

That's the take though.

*everyone laughing* Almost, almost broke a laptop.

But that's fine.

We're good.

Clayton (offscreen): Set a couple fires, it's okay!

Brian: We, we, this is the most intense...

Pat: We're not allowed to do this show anymore. 
 2020-06-25 16:22:25,585 - DEBUG - file running:  *hydraulic machine noises*

Fallout.

This scrappy, billion-dollar franchise takes a fun, kooky

look at planet-wide armageddon.

It's an alternate history, splitting off from our timeline somewhere

around World War II.

Despite the divergence, Fallout features some familiar real world

culture and plenty of cultural innovation. There are new architectural styles that are

stolen from Mad Max. And plenty of cool new fashion

that is also just ripped off from Mad Max.

And yet, even with this cultural innovation, Fallout has one massive problem.

And there's only one problem with the Fallout series right now.

Other than that, the Fallout series is doing just fine.

D-despite this one. It's just the one of them.

Why, Todd,

is the music still this?

*audio from three Fallout songs played simultaneously*

The same dozen songs from before the apocalypse.

You're telling me that humans figured out how to

make a gun that turns you into goo, and yet they haven't made any new music?

That’s garbage, Todd.

Fallout is a meditation on mutation and the ways that humanity and culture

evolve to meet new challenges,

and having music that stays the same the whole time is a plot hole.

War never changes. But music should.

And today, I’m going to change it.

*tech montage music playing*

Ooh! This is a new dance move for me.

I don't know if I like it yet.

Now, you may think that Fallout’s music is fine. It fits the aesthetic, and

it adds a sense of retrofuturism.

But you’re wrong, and here’s why.

The Fallout games range in time from 2102, the year of Fallout 76, to 2287, the year of Fallout 4.

That’s a span of 185 years. Imagine for a second that our musical sensibilities hadn’t been

updated in nearly two hundred years, and the current song topping the Billboard charts

was The Alphabet Song, a song literally written about 185 years ago.

Actually, that kind of sounds possible. Modern times are weird.

What I’m saying is that if 80% of humans died today, in 100 years,

we'd still have Old Town Road, but it would have a few more remixes.

Do you really think that if the world ended in 1997, our culture would linger over

"Barbie Girl" and "Tubthumping"? That we would be complacent with the cultural detritus of euro-techno,

manufactured pop, and third-wave ska?

NO!

And yet it seems the people of Fallout have

forgotten how to make music.

Fallout 76 is littered with instruments and bandstands and stages,

but by the time you get to Fallout 3, the only instrument left is a Stradivarius

violin locked in a vault surrounded by mirelurks.

Fallout 76 also has the highest track count,

nearly twice as many as all of the other games, which implies that these tracks are being

lost over time, and nothing is there to replace it.

Only two people in the entire 185-year-span

of these games are making new songs. The first is a synth that makes the same bluesy style

as the rest of the music.

It’s good but it’s not different.

The other is a burnout DJ who does not seem to know how to sing or play an instrument.

And yet he still insists on playing a guitar,

which goes to prove that even in the apocalypse, you can’t escape

the guy who will bring his guitar to your party.

Thank god the bombs went off before "Wonderwall."

People need food to eat, sure, and, you know, clothes to cover their sinful

bods so that makes sense that those areas have continued to flourish. But Fallout is

a world where people have ignored the basic human endeavor of making art.

I won’t stand for that!

We need art because of its fundamental importance to human expression.

Songs were made long before written language to help keep stories alive, and they'd be added to

and embellished, much like the cultural touchstone of our time,

TVTropes.org.

Science may improve our health and longevity, but art is what makes long life worth living.

And that’s why I am here — to scientifically improve on this art,

and synthesize a totally new genre of music that we should be hearing in the Fallout universe.

This genre should be inspired by the music landscape and culture of Fallout's world.

Any cultural step that goes One Step Beyond current accepted standards

risks alienating its audience by being too challenging,

too intelligent.

So let’s guide our creation by considering the 10 definitive purposes of music

and how they fit into the beautiful wasteland of Todd’s mindscape.

First, to create or control emotion.

From the soaring, triumphant music of Jurassic Park

to the ice cream truck version of "Pop Goes the Weasel,"

which, for reasons I don’t understand, always makes me cry.

Evoking emotion is the number one use for music.

So what does that mean for Fallout? Well, one thing the soundtrack does get right is the upbeat tempo

of most of the songs. It cheers up the experience of playing through the wasteland.

Except for the miserable, inescapable energy of "Johnny Guitar."

Play it again, my Johnny.

In the wasteland, you need something to rev you up, keep you moving. And that's why this new genre

will only feature peppy songs.

Two: remembering or sharing information.

These can be simple mnemonics like Schoolhouse Rock! Or classic story ballads

like Kesha’s "TiK ToK."

I actually believe these will be more important than emotions just because

written language seems to be pretty dead in the future. It’s all on abandoned computers

or in diaries safely tucked up in a skeleton's ribcage.

Up-to-date information is transmitted verbally, and think about how much further it could go if it was sung.

Even an S.O.S. signal gets more traction if it comes with a little ditty,

and I learned that from Rihanna.

Three: Entertainment.

*cheesy music plays*

Four: Jingles. In other words,

propaganda.

Commercial jingles are designed to make you remember brands, and political songs fit here, too.

Because what is the "Star Spangled Banner" if not America’s jingle?

Despite the amount of remnant advertising for companies like Nuka-Cola and Radiation King,

the only jingles that remain in Fallout are the ones on Gene Autry’s spurs.

*(I Got Spurs That) Jingle, Jangle, Jingle plays ominously*

In the song he says his spurs jingl-

Fallout does have a few antiquated political songs on Enclave Radio, but as Plato said:

“Any musical innovation is full of danger to the whole State...

when modes of music change, the State always changes with them.”

Thank you, Plato.

The transitive property means that the opposite must be true as well.

Fallout’s state has very much changed, and so too should the music.

So our music genre should be catchy to the point of propaganda.

You hear this song once, and you know the hook and exactly what it wants you to do.

Five: To mark time rhythmically in a group, like a chain gang or rowing.

An underlying theme of Fallout is a disruption of low-wage labor systems.

Half the locations are robot warehouses or Nuka-Cola factories

or the industrial goo pit where The Joker was made.

In the 2100s, commerce is no longer the main structure around

which a human’s life is organized.

So fuck the Man, and fuck the beat he made you drum to.

The Man was beating you down, so we’re gonna focus on the up-beats.

The off-beats. Something more syncopated.

This isn't to say we're going to get overly complicated with 7/4s and 15/8 time signatures.

Those time signatures only belong in math rock,

which is to say in the garbage.

We’re taking back 4/4 from the Man and we're making it our own.

Six: Tradition music, to mark events or occasions.

This can range from singing "Auld Lang Syne" on New Years

to playing "Pop Goes the Weasel" whenever one of your pet weasels died when you were a kid.

THAT'S WHY.

They’re just songs that usher in a specific moment, like an alarm.

But most cultures in Fallout don’t seem to use them.

At the end of the quest “A Nice Day for a Right Wedding,” there is a wedding but no wedding march.

And in the quest “For Auld Lang Syne,” they do not play "Auld Lang Syne."

Which means there’s a real opening to be the only tradition song for every holiday in Fallout.

It may seem lame to force a tradition song, like making all of your friends call you by a nickname you gave yourself,

but if you believe that every tradition song came about naturally, you’re naive.

You think Vitamin C didn’t know that the graduation song would become a once-a-year cash cow?

That when Green Day was writing “Good Riddance” they weren’t

thinking “Some sitcoms are gonna have to end someday.”

Tradition songs can be crafted,

and our first song in this new genre will fit this bill.

Seven: Ambient music or background music.

A.K.A. Chill anime beats to study and relax to.

Nobody in Fallout is studying or relaxing. This one is a guide on what not to do in our new genre.

Our genre should be present and aggressive, and when you’re listening to it, you are listening to it.

Eight: To create or maintain social groups.

Without labor to constrict a person’s time or movement,

people organize into social, cult-like gangs, which makes this category

a big one. You’ve got LARPers, the AV club, the rude boys, all of which have their own

cultural standards. But there is a distinct lack of punks, which came about through a

shared political consciousness expressed through music. But we can be that, we just need to

include identity-establishing lyrics that appeal to all denizens of the Wasteland.

Perhaps this genre will help unify all of the many warring factions.

Or at least create a new, very cool warring faction.

Number nine: Stimulating physical movement. Dancing.

There is no dancing in Fallout! Well, there are a few sex workers in Fallout New Vegas that dance, but it kind

of just looks like the dancing baby gif, so I don’t think that should count.

And Fallout 76 hasn’t included a singular dancing emote. All they have are things like “smoking kills”

and “join my polycule?”

This is probably to avoid overlapping with Fortnite, which

does have a pretty long head start on dancing emotes. So for the sake of originality, I

had my research assistant, Google, find all of the dances that haven't been included in Fortnite yet.

It's just a Regency-era quadrille, and skanking.

We will make it work.

And the tenth purpose of music is to use it as a crutch when you can’t think of a different way

to end a video.

Actually, I don't think this one really applies to the Fallout universe,

so I'm just gonna take it off.

So with our nine definitive purposes of music, we can

begin to build our genre. And the more I’m thinking about these nine purposes, the more

I'm realizing that Fallout has the opportunity to create the perfect genre. One not tied

down to the whims of society.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

The current music in Fallout is overwhelmingly jazz standards and rhythm and blues,

so we'll incorporate elements from those genres.

We’ll have heavy beats, syncopation, rhythm guitar, and honestly, any instrument

that fits in a mobile wasteland setting. So no pianos, but any marching instrument, like

trumpets and trombones. Things that stand up to roughing it and also would appeal to

the Brotherhood of Steel. Another thing these jazz standards excel at is having a powerful,

catchy melody sung by a main vocalist, but since it’s hard to maintain your safety

as a loner in the wasteland, we can have a lot of backing vocalists, too.

If you can carry a gun, you can carry a tune.

In terms of topics for the songs, we'll keep the themes

relevant to the people of Fallout, which based on my experience seems to be freedom from

tyranny, looting, and drinking so I can be stronger and carry more loot.

Now, we mix together these in-fiction elements with our nine definitive purposes of music.

One: We’re gonna make people happy. Needs to be Jeep commercial music. Yeah, your wife just got

eaten by a yao guai, but listen to that skiffle.

Two: All of our heroes are dead. So it's time

to make new heroes. How else are we gonna know how many beers Janice drank last week,

or how far Kevin’s head went flying when a super mutant tagged him with a fire hydrant.

Three:

Bangers only.

Four: What should I do with the information about how many beers

Janice drank? Tell me.

This is music for the scavenger, not the assembly line worker. There’s

a whole world of useful scrap out there, and this music should inspire you to get out there

and pick it up!

Six: The old ways are dead! And we've gotta make new songs to celebrate

the new ways. There is no song for when your Swamp Itch clears up.

But there should be.

Seven: Background music? NO. This is FOREGROUND MUSIC.

Eight: Fallout is a world divided,

awaiting a messiah of music to bring them all together

or at least inspire them to wear cooler clothes.

Nine: The music should inspire dances that are violent and rushed, just like

the world you're in. Yeah, your fists are used for melee, but that leaves your feet

and your elbows open to fuckin' jam!

You starting to imagine it? You starting to hear those first few notes in your head? THAT’S GOOD!

What are we gonna call this new genre that

is peppy! Informational! Good! Catchy! Pick up loot!

Traditional! In your face! Punk!

Kicks! Energetic! Educational! Fun! Sticks in your head! Pick it up!

For your cousin Ben's wedding! Right there! Society.

*dancing noises*

Spicy! Slaps hard! Pick it up! Propaganda.

Arbor Day! Pick it up!

Fuck you, Philip Glass!

Pick it up! Let's all wear the same shoes!

*repeating "DANCE!" and "PICK IT UP" over and over*

Pick it up!

*heavy breathing*

Did I just make Ska again?

*Ska music starts*

You spend your life living in a vault, and your mind begins to crack.

And when you get outside, there’s nothing to welcome you back.

She found me passed out in a rundown shack with Nuka Buzz in my hand.

She picked me up and she slapped my face, and said "Come on let’s start a band!"

She said: START THE MUSIC, Pick up loot, get off your ass!

If you don’t feel the Brotherhood of Steel, join the Brotherhood of Brass.

She said: START THE NEW, War never changes, that’s a bore!

You know we’ll eclipse the apocalypse

with a loud and brassy SKALLOUT WAR.

SKALLOUT WAR!

SKALLOUT WAR!

SKALLOUT WAAAAAAAAR!

SKALLOUT WAR!

I've never skanked so hard in my life. 
 2020-06-25 16:22:25,586 - DEBUG - file running:  Fire Emblem!

This magnificent franchise pushes the boundaries of gaming by daring to ask the question,

"What if chess made you horny?"

Fire Emblem is turning 30 next year, and with 16 main games and few spinoffs,

it's safe to say that it has grown into something extraordinary.

The games are packed with deep storylines and memorable characters, like Marth.

That's not Marth? Marth.

That's- which one is Marth?

Marth.

The problem with having such a prolific series is that the characters start to blend together.

One needs only to look at the Super Smash Bros. roster to see that

Fire Emblem characters are a bit hard to differentiate.

It's like trying to remember your coworkers' names after meeting them once at a work mixer.

Except in this case, your coworkers all have swords and can only make one facial expression.

But do not worry. There is an answer to this conundrum. Because today,

I'm going to teach you how to tell apart every Fire Emblem character.

*cheery synth music*

My face is just not built for this expression.

First step in this process is to collect a list of the characters.

Turns out, even after trimming the nonplayable ones and the ones from the Tokyo Mirage Sessions,

there are nearly 600 Fire Emblem characters.

I cannot explain that many characters.

I have made that mistake before.

"Trying to categorize all 600 Castlevania monsters was a bad idea."

But the beauty of making mistakes is that you can learn from them. And I now know understand

that explaining 600 discrete characters wouldn't actually be helpful.

Human beings aren't meant to remember 600 people perfectly. If you don't believe me,

just try to remember something about every single person in your contact list.

I have a contact for someone name Zain.

And in the company, it just says "Bocce Ball."

Who the fuck is this?

But unlike my contact list, Fire Emblem's have plotlines.

And in my experience playing these games, I noticed

that a lot of these different characters fit similar roles in their respective games.

And I'm not the only one who's noticed this. On the Fire Emblem wiki, there is a whole list

of archetypes based on different characters.

A list that I only found after spending whole day trying to categorize them on my own.

And it's just so fun to realize that you've wasted a whole day of work.

But this list intrigued me.

Stock characters in similar circumstances playing again and again in different stories.

Does that remind you of anything?

Of course it does!

It reminds you of the commedia dell'arte,

because it reminds me of the commedia dell'arte.

And it's so obviously the commedia dell'arte that I don't need to explain it.

But I will for the sake of extending this video.

The commedia dell'arte was an Italian form of theater that was big in the 16th to 18th centuries,

and it relied on stock characters wearing masks or costumes to designate who they were.

That way the audience could be like,

"Ah, that dude's wearing a tight fitting suit with a bunch of weird patches, that must

be Arlecchino, the servant clown — sometimes to two masters!"

This brought the audience in immediately. They knew what that character was about without any exposition.

In the same way, Fire Emblem has dozens of recurring characters that get you through each game.

And this is how we're going to tell them apart. By defining their archetypes.

Fire Emblem goes one step further.

Because these characters can not only serve the same story purpose,

but they can have a similar role in the gameplay.

And this goes to prove my theory

that Fire Emblem is not only the spiritual successor to commedia dell'arte,

it is its natural evolution.

An elevated form I call...

THE COMMEDIA DELL'ANIME.

The newer, more perfect form of theater.

We just have to boil down the Fire Emblem personnel into

*kiss*

syrupy stock characters.

Let's begin with the archetypes that are standard.

Cain and Abel are battle bros. They fight together, but not in the biblical sense.

Bord and Cords are similar except they're usually axe fighters.

Pegasus sisters are a trio of flying horses ladies.

You can't split these archetypes up into their solo characters because their bond is what defines them.

You can't have a Waluigi without a Luigi.

And in the same way, you can't have a Bord without a Cord.

Which is my favorite Dr. Seuss book.

Jagens are mentors that are strong in the beginning and then you'll quickly outpace them, and it's kind of sad.

Like the first time you beat your dad in a basketball game.

Oifeys are similar to Jagens,

except they'll keep dunking on you till you're dead.

Wendells but for magic.

Gotohs are mentors but only the last half of the game.

Beowolfs are mercenaries that you have to pay actual in-game currency

to recruit, and Ogmas are mercenaries that usually decide to join you out of their own volition.

Which is, by definition, not a mercenary.

Navarres are silent, moody sword swingers.

Kind of like if that person who said they studied the blade actually studied the blade.

There are also a bunch of villains but for different reasons. Power. Ambition. Loyalty.

Wyvern riding, I guess.

And getting possessed, which is a classic mistake.

Some archetypes are based on their gameplay requirements.

Very difficult to recruit.

Usually recruited after they've been kidnapped.

Late game recruits that could be good, but you have to work hard.

Super low level villagers that could also be good.

And if you recruit one of these pairs,

you can't get the other.

Kind of like if two of your friends start dating and then have a really messy breakup.

Corneliuses are usually the parental figure to the main character,

and they have this nasty habit of getting axed super early on in the game.

It's kind of like Fire Emblem doesn't know how to make interesting characters without making them

suffer traumatic parental death.

Tacticians. Young female mages. Young female healers.

Young male mages.

Thieves.

Jeorges do that thing where they pretend to be not important

and then SURPRISE, I wasn't an old crone, I was a magical witch the whole time!

Except they're not very good at hiding the fact that they're important.

And the creepy version of the Jeorges:

The Tikis.

Usually they take the form of a small girl or adolescent, except

they're really 400 years old and a god or a dragon.

And I honestly do not have the time to unpack this bullshit.

These 29 archetypes are useful, but they only cover 229 characters.

There are still 367 to go. If we keep this up, we're going to end up with 75 archetypes.

The commedia dell'arte only has about 17.

So before we move on, let's combine some.

These six are all mentors to varying degrees of usefulness.

These are all defined by their villainy and only some of them become playable.

Welcome to Cain Siblings Incorporated, where we all have a sibling like bond and do the same job.

These all have very specific requirements for recruiting.

These both do that thing where they don't seem important and then Surprise!

I'm important!

These are all hard to make good but they're worth it if you put the effort in.

These are all precocious little magic babies.

And that leaves the Navarres unconnected,

but that's because I'm changing the archetype to Spicy Swords. Because we can include so

many other characters if we just expand the definitions to any swordweilder

who's a little spicy.

In fact, by combining these other archetypes, there are now tons of other characters who

fit into these expanded definitions.

We are left with 288 characters to categorize. But before I get there,

I just want to commend Fire Emblem for have 596 playable characters

and only repeating three names.

When I was hired for my first job at a climbing gym,

I was one of five employees named Brian, and it was a small gym.

But I guess it's pretty easy to cut out repetitions when you use dope-ass names like Skrimir.

Dagdar.

Sleuf.

Fjorm.

Belf.

I could go on all day.

But I won't. Because it's time to get the rest of the archetypes on the wall.

*charging noise*

That took like 30 minutes. But let's begin.

The honorable knight, like Fiona, who cares passionately about her people,

and will always oppose cruelty to civilians.

Which is way better than the loyal knight, like Troude, who only is loyal

to Perne, and will do literally anything for him even though Perne is a bad dude.

But I'll get to that later.

These four archetypes are calm and aloof, and the only thing that differentiates them

is how much you would want to invite them to your birthday party.

I'm just gonna get the blank slate archetype out of the way now,

because Fire Emblem is a game with permadeath,

and so sometimes you just need more meat for the grinder, you know?

Similar to the blank slate is the protagonist,

which is always relatively heroic, but since they're a conduit for the player, they're all pretty vague.

I realize that by smooshing them all together into one category,

I've made the majority of the Fire Emblem roster in Super Smash indistinguishable.

But that's not my fault!

Super Smash should've included more magic babies!

Arrogants, hotheads, and edgelords all have a mean side,

but arrogants like Vaike just think they're the best.

Hotheads like Caspar want to fight anything that moves.

And edgelords like Niles retweet Joker accounts unironically.

A lot of these characters have rough childhoods but then turn out cheerful despite that.

And then there's the inferiority complex archetype, which I could have just called

"The majority of children in Fire Emblem: Fates."

Perfectionists, mischief makers, and flirts are all highly motivated.

But Subaki is motivated to meet high expectations.

Claude is motivated to make intricate schemes.

And Sylvain is motivated to be a fuccboi.

Buzzkills are just characters that aren't very fun to talk to.

And Fire Emblem, I will never forgive you for naming an unemotional, uber religious, deadbeat dad Gilbert.

It also doesn't help that I look like Hanneman Lite.

Oh god, am I a buzzkill?

A lot of these archetypes are based around one singular personality trait.

Scarlet's straightforward. Valbar's chill.

Linhardt's lazy. Sumia's clumsy. Petra's a sweetie.

And Ranulf is a furry.

Dramatic, painter, and fashionable are defined by their love of the arts

and how much it sucks that they gotta be a soldier instead.

Some archetypes upset the status quo by defying gender norms

or by calling out the noble class, and that's why they're comrades.

Child soldier.

Karin is canonically 14 years old.

Whoopsie!

But even if they aren't a child, they could still be naive.

Which brings around the overprotective archetype,

which is just essentially helicopter parents.

Manuela is constantly drinking and flirting and just being a hot mess and I love her for it.

And that makes her the president of vices.

The vice president.

But be careful not to do that around someone like Astram, who is constantly accusing people of treason

for no good reason.

There's a lot of characters in the meek murderer archetype

because Fire Emblem loves to make characters that are quiet and shy and really self conscious,

and then can WRECK SHOP on the battlefield.

Here's an archetype I call "what the fuck" and it's the three characters that make me say,

"What the fuck, Fire Emblem?"

People like Perne, who is said to be a sweet Robin Hood type,

except he does kidnap a young girl and keeps her as his slave.

Or Tharja, who practices curses on her own daughter.

Or Roger, who is act- he's not actually that bad.

But Fire Emblem does go out of their way to make his endscreen say that he never gets a date

and he stays single for the rest of his life.

And it's like, what the fuck, Fire Emblem? You didn't have to do him dirty like that.

The next archetype is called "actually pretty interesting." These characters are three dimensional

and well-developed. People like Libra, who struggles with his faith and has incredible

self doubt even though he's doing all he can to help those around him. Or Rhys, who dreams

of being a swordfighter, but his weak constitution won't allow him to become one. And so he helps

in the ways he can, but his whole story is one of unfulfilled dreams.

And that's it.

Those are the only two interesting characters in Fire Emblem.

Until we get to Raphael.

My sweet, bulky boy who only cares about eating and training and not about studying.

The thing is, the Fire Emblem world has moved past himbos and bimbos.

Welcome to the age of thembos.

There. 45 archetypes to help you differentiate the 596 Fire Emblem characters.

If you're a GOSH DANG ROCKET SCIENTIST!

45 is still too much! We can combine these.

We'll take these six and combine them to create a new archetype that is as important as it is bland.

These three can be more succinctly summarized in a category called

"Holy shit, why are you a soldier?"

Let's just go ahead and cordon off all of the assholes.

And now we can take these straight-talking suck ups and call them teacher's pets.

Shhhh.

These three archetypes all have tough exteriors to break through.

These three archetypes really explore familial bonds,

which is a RARE CONDITION, IN THIS DAY-

Whether it's a good or bad reaction doesn't matter to this group, they just want to be seen.

They're just too nice for all this!

These four archetypes will always be subverting expectations.

It's fairly surprising that these three archetypes were let in.

Chill dudes? Gambling? A bunch of hunks?

Damn if these aren't fun to hang out with.

All three of these are going to time out, 'cause they need to calm it down.

And there we go.

The 13 archetypes that make it possible to differentiate the Fire Emblem characters.

Just 13 of them.

That's fewer than the commedia dell'arte.

It's only 13.

Which is not only an unlucky number,

but it is TOO LARGE for your TINY CHILD BRAINS.

We can make it better! We can combine more! WE CAN PERFECT THIS!

Granted, it's a little bit harder to combine these archetypes, but just off the bat, we can take

"look at me baby" and "making waves" and just combine it into one thing, trendsetters.

And the "necessary but boring" and the "asshole crew" and the "teacher's pets" and the "calm it downs,"

they all fill me with a sense of UGH.

And obviously the "too nice for this" and the "lied on your resume" and the "holy shit why are you a soldiers"

are all just a bad choice for a war!

And that just leaves us with the characters that are hard to break

the ice with, and uh, the ones that got family issues, and the quiet ones, and the ones that

are fun to hang out with!

Uh.

And that just sounds like a pretty run-of-the-mill

awkward family reunion.

And when you think about it, these ones are just strange characters that

have, uh, that are good at fighting.

I mean if you include Dmitri in this, he has an eye patch!

Okay, which is similar to these ones.

Seteth and Byleth have the, they rhyme.

Uh we also, I mean.

Dorothea wears a hat until she grows out of the hat.

Think about that!

Don't even get me started on Oboro.

I don't know who that is.

Is it pronounced "dice" or "deesay?"

And we can have a category called

"anime character with a singular personality trait and a penchant for violence"

and that's just the one category!

Which PROVES that the Fire Emblem characters are all essentially the same,

and that you cannot differentiate them.

Mission complete!

What was this Unraveled about again?

...Sometimes to two masters!

Patrick: Now Italian.

(Brian in a shitty Italian accent) Ah! That guy is...

oh god I don't know if I can.

Ah that dudes wearing a tight fitting suit with a buncha weird patches it

must be Arlecchino the servant clown sometimesa to two masters!

(Pat and Jenna offscreen laughing)

Brian: Ah I don't know if... Okay.

Pat: We don't have to use it but we need to record it. 
 2020-06-25 16:22:25,586 - DEBUG - file running:  Should auld acquaintance be forgot.

And

all

that

JAZZ.

THAT’S RIGHT FRIENDS it’s Game of the Year season!

Which means it's time for us to hop on those message boards, chat about our favorite games,

and tear out each other’s throats when someone expresses an opinion

that is slightly different from our own.

By this point, pretty much every gaming publication has announced their Game of the Year...

uhh...

which means that I'm a bit late.

Anything that I say is just a drop in the ocean of discourse.

No one wants to hear my opinion.

WHICH IS WHY I AM NOT EXPRESSING AN OPINION.

I AM STATING A FACT.

That’s right, I have devised a statistical, analytical, number-crunching formula

that will SCIENTIFICALLY PROVE

THE GAME OF THE YEAR.

*hype 80s music plays*

They said it couldn’t be done.

A bias-free formula to calculate the game of the year?

That's a fool’s errand, Brian!

You are a fool!

They called me a fool!

But do I look like a fool to you?

I’ve done it, and with the knowledge I have found, I can go ahead and assuage any arguments

you might have with your friends.

There is nothing to debate anymore, there is only the truth, that the best game of the year is...

hidden somewhere, um, in these spreadsheets.

I'm gonna be honest with you, I haven’t...

there are a lot of numbers.

And I haven't had the time to, uh, do them all just yet.

But it’s only December 14th.

This video is set to go up on the 30th, which means I still have two weeks for new games

to come in before I can really call which game is the game of the year.

But I've at least finished the formula, and I’ve tested it on a few to make sure it

runs correctly.

And everyone knows that you can’t get full credit unless you show your work.

So let me show you how I made it.

First thing you gotta do when you're making a GOTY formula is find your list of games.

And obviously we're going to have to choose every single game that was released this year

in order for us to say that it is scientifically accurate.

So if we just go ahead and take a look at Steam and see how many were released since

January 1st 20-hmm.

That's over 15,000.

You can't make me do that, legally.

That's not in my contract.

Right?

I can't... they can't legally make me do that.

Look, as much as video game reviews can be an imperfect reflection of the person who

is writing them, they are still a pretty solid baseline for which video games mattered in our culture.

Even if a review is bad, it still means it was good enough for someone to spend time on it.

So I went Metacritic and I took all the games that were rated 80 or above, and at

the time of writing this script, that was 181 games.

So I'm gonna do the formula for all of those.

Some of these games were DLCs or re-releases onto new platforms.

The Switch alone resurrected about a dozen candidates from years past.

But since they were released this year, they are still technically in the running.

Fight me.

Now that we have the list, it's time to make the formula, and it might surprise you to

hear this, but I have not been in a pure mathematics class in about five years.

So I reached out to some scientists.

And then none of them got back to me.

So I called my old roommate.

“Hey, I’m Nicholas.

I’m a graduate student studying exoplanet atmospheres.”

Nick is working toward a PhD at MIT, and though I was a bit worried about reaching out to

him since his specialization is in astrophysics and not stats about video games,

he assuaged all my fears.

Brian - "Would you say you are a math expert?”

Nick - “No.”

We chatted for about a half an hour, diving deep into the scientific method and the selfless

goals of discovery.

Brian - “If I invent a unit... can I trademark it.”

Nick - “I think your final score should be, like, in Gilberts or whatever.”

Brian - "OK!"

And we finished our chat with the reassurance that this formula was not only going to help

the gaming community, but the scientific community at large.

Brian - “Do you think if I wrote this up, I could get it published in, like, Nature?"

Nick - “No.”

So where to do we go from here now that we have been scientifically rejuvenated?

It's time to build the criteria.

What specifically makes a game of the year?

Number one, what is the game worth?

We're not just talking about monetary worth, we're also talking about the amount of enjoyment

you get while playing the game.

Number two, how them graphics?

We’re trying to find specific numbers associated with these games, and graphics is just a bunch

of numbers anyway, so this will be a useful part.

Number three, how did it affect the cultural miasma?

Look, it’s all about those google results, how many people are talking about the game?

And most importantly, is the game art?

I've figured it out.

Which means that no one has to write any more goddamn thinkpieces about this topic ever again!

Given these four criteria, I sat down with Tara Long, former bioinformatics researcher

and also my current boss.

She and I figured out a formula that will end up with a numerical value that will tell

us the game of the year.

The higher the number, the better the game.

We’ll start with game worth.

Now it’s hard for us to find how worth it a game is to play from a numerical standpoint,

but if you take Metacritic’s score as a percentage of the game you enjoy, and you

multiply that by the average amount of minutes each playthrough takes using the stats from

howlongtobeat.com, then you end up with a number of minutes you have spent enjoying said game.

Now, to tie in material worth, we want to go ahead and take in the original listed price

of the game and divide it by this number so that way we can end up with a DPM: dollars

per minute enjoyed.

Now, it’s hard to decide if you want a high or a low DPM, because some people want the

most bang for their buck, while others are willing to spend a little bit more for a really

well-enjoyed minute.

But just to standardize this, I'm going to assume lower is better — that means you've

paid less per minute you've enjoyed — and that way I can use it to divide literally

the rest of the equation.

HOW BOUT THEM GRAPHICS?

In the past few years, people have cared less and less about how many

polygons you've got on the screen and more about the style.

But one thing that hasn't changed is frame rate.

People want the most frames per second.

So, factually, the more frames, the better.

That means we're going to go ahead and take the highest frame rate available in the game

and we're gonna multiply that by the seconds of average playthrough, again from howlongtobeat.com.

And that will give us the amount of frames per game.

The game frames mainframe.

But how many frames does a gamer game in the gameframe mainframe?

That's a good question.

Now if you go ahead and you take your frames per game and divide it by the number of gamers,

I’m talking about however many copies have been sold or however many number of downloads

there have been, then that's going to leave you with frames per game per gamer, and that’s

a really important number, because if you have 200,000 frames per game and you have

200,000 gamers, that's 200,000 gamers that have only had one frame per game per gamer.

And that is no good, is it?

Is it?

I actually have... um, I'm a little confused now.

We're gonna take frames per game per gamer and we're gonna put it on the top of this

equation, because we want it to be the biggest number possible.

And now it’s time for cultural relevancy.

We want our games of the year to be big and brash and bold and boisterous, letting people

outside of the gaming world know,

Hey!

This is a thing!

So how do we judge a game’s effect on the world at large?

Well, we go ahead and we take all of the Google results that come up when you search

the game's full name and the word game.

But that’s not everything, right?

That's just the bare minimum.

It's like saying, “This dude’s bad haircut is important just because a lot of people are talking about it,”

which I know isn’t true from personal experience.

So I went on twitter and I asked you lovely folks what descriptors you expect to see in

descriptions of games of the year.

And you gave me a lot.

So I went ahead and I plugged all those into Google’s advanced search along with the

game's name, and I took those results and I multiplied it by the base Google search.

And I got very big numbers.

But don't worry, we're going to bring these numbers down to size, because some of the

descriptions you sent in were actually pretty negative descriptions of games.

So I did a Google search using those descriptions, and then I multiplied those results by one

plus the number of Funko Pops made of characters in the game,

which is objectively a terrible thing.

Now this is going to leave you with BCE, or your base cultural effect, and we're gonna

multiply that by our FPGPG in order to get a pretty big number.

But before we’re done with cultural effect, I want you to ask yourself, is this the culture at large?

Does this go outside of our gaming bubble?

There’s really only one way to tell that, and that's by using the M.O.M. variable,

which stands for: "My Own Mother."

So I called my own mother for help.

"Hello, Brian, I'm a follower and a subscriber as well as your mother."

Brian - "That's very good to hear.

I... you support me so well and I appreciate that.

I should ask you, Mom, would you consider yourself a gamer?"

Mom - "When I play Mario Kart with, like, grandchildren and things like that, I always

go off the road."

Brian - "That's, but, on purpose to let them feel better."

Mom - "Very similar to my real-life driving skills, I find."

Brian - "I have a list of 181 video games, now I know that's a lot.

I'm basically gonna run through this, and I'm gonna ask you if you have heard of this game.

Red Dead Redemption 2."

Mom - "No."

Brian - "God of War."

Mom - "Yes!

I have heard of that."

Brian - "Oh, OK!"

While subjecting my mom to a litany of 2018's best games,

it became clear that she was very interested in the topic.

Brian - "We're only 57 in, so we've still got another 130 to go."

Mom - "I can't tell you how, what an exciting time this is for me."

Brian - "Now you get taste of what it's like to do my job."

Mom - "I tell you what, this is a lot of research into things that really have very little meaning."

Brian - "You're right.

It is."

So once I had asked my mom about all of the games from the game of the year list, I was

able to throw it into a boolean function.

If mom knows game equals true, then that’s a plus one here.

And then I could raise our base cultural effect to the power of mom, so if she doesn't know

it, that's just to the power of one.

If she does, that's to the power of two.

Finally, it’s time for our fourth, and perhaps most important criteria: Is this game art?

And when you start asking if something is art, then you really end up asking,

"Why should we even be defining what is and isn't art?"

And the only thing worse than discourse about "are games art?" is

the discourse ABOUT the discourse of "are games art?"

Look, art is experiential and that's a beautiful thing that should be allowed to flourish without

having some pseudoscientific proof of greatness thrust upon it.

Which is why I'm not proving greatness.

Instead, this part of the formula is so revolutionary because I am proving art.

So let's go ahead and throw this into...

Shit, I ran out of space.

You know what, this part wasn't that important.

We're just gonna cut it.

This big GOTY equation ends up with very large numbers, which would be too hard to show all of.

So I needed to make a new unit.

Something I could reduce them all down to.

I plugged in my favorite game of the year, Celeste, and I used that to be our new baseline.

Celeste equals one BDG.

Or Big Determinant of Game.

Everything else will be reduced down using Celeste’s score to a scale of BDGs.

So that's it.

That’s the entire formula.

And if you'll excuse me, I have to go do my dark bidding on these spreadsheets and I will

come back to you right now.

December 30th.

New year is at our doorstep.

Knock knock!

Who’s there?

It’s 2019!

Come on in, hope you're not as big of an asshole as the past few of your friends!

I spent the past two weeks crunching the numbers, and it is my honor to announce that

2018’s scientifically calculated game of the year, with 19...

trillion BDGs...

is Fortnite.

That can't be the right number, I'm gonna...

No, that's right.

You remember when Pluto stopped being a planet, and the scientists were like,

"Hey, that's just what the definitions say!"

And we were like,

"Hey, scientists, maybe your definitions are busted!"

Maybe my formula is busted.

The fact that God of War got 2.1 million BDGs and Red Dead Redemption 2 got 0.1 BDG...

Maybe I shouldn't have made my mom's knowledge of the game an exponential factor.

Brian - "You know Tetris.

You would really like this Tetris..."

Mom - *sings the entire Tetris song*

No, I stand by that decision.

Let’s be honest, the stats I was using definitely favored cultural importance, and Fortnite’s

cultural effect was orders of magnitude larger than any other game this year.

And though I've never played Fortnite

— which proves my lack of bias and also that I’m professionally irresponsible —

there can be no denying that it has made a lasting impact

outside of the video game world.

It’s the only nonseries game that my mom knew about.

And regardless of how you feel about the Fortnite, it drew together a collection of people that

might not have otherwise connected, and that’s a valuable thing.

And even when your Uncle Devin comes up to you at the holiday get together and says,

“HEY BRIAN, WHAT IN THE HECK IS THIS FORTNITE THING?”

it gives you a common ground to chat,

and you really haven't chatted with Uncle Devin in a while.

You should call him more often.

He wants to show you his Civil War books.

And his collection of swords.

But if you’re upset, and you didn’t IMMEDIATELY close this YouTube tab to send me an angry tweet,

I’ve got an extra little gift for you.

It's a new formula.

GOTY equals x times 1 quadrillion.

And x equals your favorite game.

Of this year.

Now you can go ahead and tell your friends that Brian scientifically proved that my favorite game

is the game of the year, and then you can share them this link,

and then they won’t click on it because it’s a 15 minute video, so your secret is safe with me.

And to be honest, your favorite game deserves it,

because if you liked it enough to call it your game of the year,

then it must be pretty meaningful to you,

and no one can take that away.

So congratulations, Fortnite, and congratulations, your favorite game.

Here’s hoping 2019 is full of wonderful games and even more wonderful experiences.

*wink*

Happy New Year.

OH.

OH MY GOD THAT IS SO HOT.

OHHH MY GOD.

IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PROP WATER, PAT.

OH I PROBABLY JUST LIKE RUINED THIS MIC, TOO.

JESUS, PAT.

I TOLD YOU IT WAS PROP WATER.

GOD.

I'm okay.

Mom - "Does enthusiasm count or anything like that?

Should it just be, or just be, just bare bones..."

Brian - "Mom, to be honest, I don't think you can do this not enthusiastically, so,

you're gonna be fine." 
 2020-06-25 16:22:25,586 - DEBUG - file running:  PC gaming is a vast ocean of entertainment,

and if you want to explore, all you have to do is sail out.

And speaking of selling out,

this is my first-ever sponsored video!

That's right, the-

the folks over at Riot have decided to corporately sanction

a video from a man who is best known

for hanging sad clown portraits in his apartment.

You see, they just released VALORANT,

and since I'm currently stuck at home

they were kind enough to give me a budget

to help turbocharge my computer,

so that way I could unravel how to get good at PC gaming.

But the thing about VALORANT

is that you don't need a high-end PC to play it.

Riot told me that even on an old clunker

with minimum specs, you can still play competitively.

And sure enough, I excavated my ancient PC

in order to test this, and it played great.

- It plays great.

Oh, that doesn't count.

So I could use that sponsorship money

to soup up my computer or I could use it

to solve one of PC gaming's biggest problems.

Unlike a console, which can plug into a communal TV,

true PC gaming needs a dedicated space.

I live in a three-bedroom apartment with two other roommates

and they are not gonna be cool with me

setting up my sick rig in the spot where we keep

recycling that we haven't taken out in two weeks.

In fact, the only unused personal space I have

is this four-foot square right next to my radiator.

And I like to keep that block unused

for whenever I wanna feel like a rich person.

- Check me out!

But maybe, with a little help from my sponsor...'s money,

I can turn those 16 square feet into a gamer's paradise.

Today I'm teaching you how to make the perfect gamer space.

(lively dance music)

Oh!

Yeah!

For inspiration, I asked a couple coworkers

what they look for in a PC gaming space.

- Hi, I'm Jeff Ramos.

- I'm Julia.

If there was anyone at Polygon who could lead me

to gamer space perfection it would be Jeff and Julia,

and in our discussions it became clear

that there are four major elements

to a good gaming environment.

The first is a solid foundation.

If I want to build a PC gaming space,

where should I start?

- First, I think you need a computer.

- Check!

But without these other foundational elements,

I'll have less of a gamer space

and more of an ominous obelisk.

From there, you can start embellishing your foundation

with element two, a virtual gaming space,

which is just a fancy way of saying

a place you can stream games from.

- It made me feel a little less lonely

as I'm studying and stuff,

because there's just like a voice.

And I guess I wanted to do that for people, also.

- Streaming for you was less about

getting big and it was more about

sharing an experience with your friends.

- If I got big along the way I would be like, "That's fine."

- Element three is aesthetics.

If you're gonna spend hours at your computer,

at the very least it should be nice to look at,

and it should represent you.

- Everything else at my desk is black.

There's very little decoration, and I like that

'cause it's clear mind, I can just focus

on what I'm doing at any given moment,

versus looking at a desk full of Funko Pops.

- I had, I think, this specific Pop figure

of Vi from "League of Legends."

and then it just kind of expanded.

Since I work from home, too,

I try to make my space fun and engaging.

- And the final element: Caters to bodily needs.

- What type of chair is that that you're sitting in?

- Oh, it's a terrible one and it's going to be replaced.

And it gives me consistent back pain.

- Does that affect your gaming at all?

- If I'm not comfortable, then I'm just thinking,

"Dang, my butt hurts, my back hurts,"

and then I can't pay attention to things.

- Do you ever eat near your computer?

Do you ever have to refuel?

- I try to separate eating from my desk space.

There is a space off to the left where I usually

will always have a coffee cup and a water bottle,

and sometimes there'll be like a snack.

- When you're in the throes of a match,

you don't wanna be worried about your back hurting

or feeling a little famished,

and that means your gamer space should provide

the fuel and comfort your body needs.

If you can amalgamate these four elements,

you'll have a good gamer space.

But I'm making the perfect one.

And how can we prove it's perfect?

An increase in gaming performance!

Ha ha, you thought I wasn't gonna do

what I was sponsored to do!

Get outta here, I'm just killin' two birds with one stone!

My coworkers said in no uncertain terms

that a good gamer space will make me a better gamer.

Once I have a dedicated space,

that's gonna be all I'm gonna need

in order to be proficient at this game?

- Well, you should still practice a little bit, I mean--

- Though I normally don't let little things like rules

stand between me and victory,

"Valorant" has anti-cheat software

that kinda makes that impossible,

so there really is no way for me

to get good at this game without practicing.

But a perfect gamer space will envelop me

in a cocoon of learning,

shutting out the world around me.

By the end of this build, I'll prove

that I've developed a perfect gamer space

by showing just how much better at PC gaming I've become.

Luckily, that's not a very high bar.

That doesn't count.

And with my four elements defined, it was time to start.

I taped out the four-by-four square

and purchased a desk that would fit within the perimeter,

built the desk, got the monitor unpacked,

computer, keyboard, mouse in position,

and we were in business.

Element one, check.

I hopped right into "Valorant," and things were going

way better than with my coffee table setup.

And in hindsight,

maybe I should've stopped there.

But I still had money to burn.

You see, I really was getting better at "Valorant,"

but I had no way of clearly showing

just how well I was doing.

And as Jeff said--

- 'Cause if I no-scope and there's no one around to see it,

then does it matter?

- I ordered a nice microphone and got out my old webcam

to set up my streaming space.

All right, check, check.

We are set to go, everything looks great on the... game.

Things do not look as great...

Although I was prepared to start gaming for the masses,

my room was not.

I can do better than this.

If I go live with this setup,

everyone's gonna make fun of my finger-jointed

builder's-grade garbage molding!

I can't be known as the substandard molding guy.

Luckily, I had two sources of inspiration

for gamer space aesthetics on opposite

sides of the spectrum.

I wanted to land somewhere in the middle.

Obviously, the first step

was installing RGB LEDs, because a gamer space

without constantly changing rainbow lights

is like a little league coach without wraparound Oakleys.

I also purchased a modest number of game figurines,

because even with a sponsor,

hoo boy, those things are expensive.

But at the end of this, my space still felt pretty empty,

so I gathered all the figurines I could find.

All of them.

Beyond this, there was nothing behind me

to brand me as a true gamer for the stream viewers,

so I mocked up a quick poster idea

and sent it over to my coworker Pat

for some illustration work,

and used a little bit more of that sponsor money

to purchase a large cloth banner.

Oh my god.

It's perfect.

Finally, I purchased a video game-themed birthday party set,

and with that my aesthetic was complete.

What's up, y'all!

I am back at it at the streaming setup.

We've got everyone here.

You can tell, as I always say back there,

don't talk to me before I've had my gaming.

I just have a little, there's actually nothing in this cup.

I should probably get something into this cup.

Jeff warned me about keeping snacks off my desk,

but I was worried about getting hangry

in the middle of gaming.

So I prepped some peanut butter toast.

Also, Julia had a specific piece of advice

about emotional needs.

- I have one of the guy from Beastars,

so when I get too mad about playing video games

I can look at him and he'll soothe me.

- Though the sight of an anthropomorphic wolf

isn't necessarily soothing to me,

I do think it's important for me to have something

to calm me down after the rough matches:

Warm milk.

And I still had some sponsorship money left over,

so I purchased myself a gamer chair.

Unfortunately, the only one that could ship in time

was the largest size, which meant

I had to rearrange some furniture.

And with that, the perfect gamer space was complete,

all four elements checked.

The gamer space is created,

and all that's left for me to do

is be the gamer within the space.

I played a few matches, taking a sip from the warm milk

any time I got a little flustered.

But for some reason, I wasn't much better

than when I started this journey.

It's just that my wrists hurt.

That's the only reason why things aren't going great.

Even after running to the drugstore

to pick up some compression braces,

my gaming didn't improve.

It didn't make any sense.

I had spent over a week building this gamer space,

which included dozens of minutes playing VALORANT.

Why wasn't I any better?

The space isn't perfect yet.

That's the only explanation.

I hadn't reached my goal of being a better PC gamer.

But I also hadn't run out of sponsor money.

It was time for a second pass.

My single monitor wasn't giving me

enough screen real estate for what really mattered:

My stream setup.

So I got a second one, and also some nice lights.

We have now upgraded our new space.

I can now see my game, and I can also see

what my stream setup's gonna be.

It's lookin' good.

Enough.

But good enough is never enough

when one is striving for perfection.

The problem with streaming is that most people are okay

with one camera and one game.

I am an auteur who understand the importance

of cilimintography, and if I'm supposed to stream

in a manner that matches my ourverver,

I NEED.

MORE.

CAMERAS.

Sadly, pretty much every webcam is currently sold out.

I was running low on time,

and that's one thing sponsor money can't buy.

But it can buy enterprise level

video conferencing solutions.

Just wanted to check in really quickly

to let you know that

I am unstoppable!

*CACKLING*

- [Roommate] Brian!

- Sorry.

I figured out how to do three cams on OBS,

and now I can play a game.

Which is great, except looking at the overlay,

it's a little busy.

Our little test proved that there were

two big issues with our space.

The first was that the cameras took up most of the screen.

The second is that my roommates didn't enjoy hearing me yell,

which is nothing new.

But that's when it hit me.

I have a plan on how to kill two birds with one stone:

By recycling all of the boxes I've received.

If I could create a soundproof box around my gamer space

and cover it in a green screen,

then I'd have more screen space

and my roommates would stop yelling at me.

So I used more of my sponsorship money

to buy a bunch of expensive studio foam,

and I taped it to a bunch of cardboard.

And then I threw a green screen over the top of it

and viola, a hermetically sealed gamer space.

Now, a few of you might be wondering,

"How does one get into this space?"

But you'll see that right behind my air conditioning unit,

there's a way that I can crawl underneath there.

And the best part about it, it's not even dark

because we've got the... I put in the LEDs!

All I have to do is just weasel my way in.

They say, "No pain, no gain."

And you know, I'm a gamer

"No pame, no game."

Maybe that's better than my current slogan.

Oh, get the head through first,

'cause that's the hardest part of it, you know.

Just kinda like...

being born.

Ah, okay.

Oh.

Do a quick one 180.

And then you swap up, and then you're here.

And then you're in the,

(sighs) and then you're in the gamer space.

As easy as pie.

After a vigorous four-minute entrance,

it was clear that things were working out great.

Check this out!

Look, there's so much I can,

you can see the whole UI.

So there is the problem of these screens.

I spend a lot of time trying to make sure

that I had a cool-looking background.

Such is the curse of the green screen.

Though you can put anything behind it,

sometimes you are left with the void.

I worked so hard to make sure

that my background expressed my gamerhood,

and the gamer box just covered it up.

I wanted to digitally recreate it,

but since I had three cameras it would have to be in 3D.

So I reached out to my coworker Jenna

to mock something up in Blender for me,

based on some previous images I had of my gamer space.

Okay, so we just got the new background set up.

Let's get up in here!

Alrighty, okay.

(grunting) Okay!

I can...

Shit.

(groans) My shirt got caught on a thing.

This was a rude awakening, but a necessary one.

My current clothing setup was not compatible

with the gaming rig, so I figured out a new way

to kill two birds with one stone.

The idea came from my compression braces.

My wrists felt so much better while compressed,

and it made me wonder:

What if all of me was compressed?

So I looked up those tactical black skin suits

that athletes wear in the Olympics,

but I was running dangerously low on time and money

so I had to order from a less-than-scrupulous vendor.

And when it finally arrived it was not to my specifications.

I didn't have any more time.

The deadline was fast approaching.

So I dealt with what I had,

crawled into my sweltering gamer space and--

I see what the problem is now.

My new compression suit was causing me

to dissolve into Jenna's wonderful background.

So I asked her to remodel it,

this time with a 3D photorealistic virtual Brian

that I could superimpose my face onto.

And the worst part of it was that--

And I forgot my snacks!

But in all tribulations there is a chance for greatness,

and greatness was found with a little inspiration,

a little heat exhaustion

and the very last of my sponsorship money.

I'm covered head to toe in this important green screen,

and I don't want this to get marred, obviously.

So what I've come up with,

instead of having to eat toast with my hands,

is that I've purchased

a horse feedbag.

And I was worried about, you know,

my hot milk is gonna start to cool down.

And my computer right now is running a little bit hot, too.

Why don't I just kill two birds with one stone?

There are tons of liquid-cooled computers out there,

and if I use this tubing, I can feed the cool milk

through the PC, cooling it down perfectly,

up around my headset, over the microphone.

Okay, I got my feedbag, which will allow me to eat my snacks

and then I've got my warm milk, which is also

gonna be cooling my computer in the box.

I'll have my snacks and I'll have my box,

and I can stay in there.

With the invention of the milk-cooled PC, patent pending,

and the feedback-sustained me, patent pending,

the perfect gamer space was complete.

Okay.

(grunts) Hello!

Gamers.

I have my feedbag, I tossed it over beforehand.

The crown of it all,

my milk-cooled PC.

(Brian panting)

Let's get gamin'.

Thought the feedbag worked wonders,

I was still doing poorly in my matches.

I was getting flustered and couldn't focus,

but that's nothing a little warm milk couldn't help.

Come on! (groans)

See, I don't get, oh, no no no no no, stop!

No no no, uh, shit!

Shit, shit!

Ah!

Oh, this is bad!

This is very bad!

This is very bad!

After mopping up the MILK MSTR's lactose coolant fluid

and toweling myself off,

I broke out the gaming laptop I borrowed from work

and sat back down in my original VALORANT test position.

And I was better.

Without the lights and the monitors

and the hands-free snacks,

I was gaming better on a coffee table

than in my dedicated space.

So did I screw up

and kill too many birds with too few stones?

Or was I a less than perfect gamer?

Perhaps I was asking a toddler to pilot a helicopter.

There's nothing wrong with

my hot cardboard box of gaming perfection.

I simply was not ready to handle it responsibly.

One day, I will reenter that cocoon

and emerge a wonderful gaming butterfly.

But before I grow my wings,

this little grub must learn to crawl.

And also how to defuse the spike without dying.

It seems impossible.

Has anyone done it yet?

I doubt anyone's done that yet.

That's ridiculous.

(cheery music)

Oh, I'm so dumb.

I screwed it in the wrong way.

- [Karen] I didn't wanna say nothin'.

- You didn't wanna say nothin'?

- [Karen] Well, I looked at it and I knew.

- You looked at it and you knew?

- [Karen] Yeah. (laughs)

- And you didn't say nothin'?

No! 
 2020-06-25 16:22:25,587 - DEBUG - file running:  Kingdom Hearts 3 is finally here.

And I have received an excessive amount of requests to explain the storyline.

That seems perfectly reasonable.

You want to be caught up before you hop into the third game.

But judging by the wording on a few of these requests, it seems like I have a…

TALL TASK

ahead of me.

But could I possibly help you understand the gargantuan, magnificent,

epic storyline of Kingdom Hearts?

You sweet summer child.

You babe swaddled in the cashmere blanket of ignorance.

YOU ASK TOO LITTLE OF ME.

Because not only can I help you understand Kingdom Hearts.

But I will give you the tools necessary to understand any story you are ever faced with

for the rest of your life.

*music plays*

Please, oh baby, don’t go.

~Simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonight.~

*CLAP CLAP*

Spoiler Warning!

I’m about to explain the entirety of the Kingdom Hearts series.

Now, if you don’t want to be spoiled for all of the games released up until now…

I don’t know why you clicked on this video.

Because I feel like the title kinda explained that that’s what I was gonna do.

So that’s on you.

Uh, but ALSO.

Potential spoiler warning!

You see, when I explain the tools of the literary trade, I might just be able to accurately

predict the true ending of Kingdom Hearts 3.

Now, the game hasn’t been released yet, and I have not played it, but…

Consider yourself warned.

We’re talking about the hero’s journey or the monomyth.

This is a concept that’s been around for a long time.

But it was popularized by a guy named Joseph Campbell back in 1949 when he released a book

called The Hero with a Thousand Faces.

Campbell inspired plenty of other creative writers and literary analysts, including a

guy called Christopher Vogler, who wrote his own book in the 1990s.

But before that, in the 1980s, he was working as a story consultant for a little company

called Disney.

When he was there, he sent out a seven-page memo that basically broke down all the big

ideas from Campbell’s book into 12 simple steps to writing good stories.

Did the memo work?

I don’t know.

Why don’t you ask Timon and Pumbaa?

They…

They’re from the Lion King.

That was a movie that Disney Produced.

A lot of people think it’s a great movie.

Kingdom Hearts as described by the monomyth.

We’ve got 12 stages up here, kinda like a clock.

It’s a story wheel.

And I’ll go through piece by piece explaining Kingdom Hearts 1, so that way you can understand

what these stages are.

Once you do understand these stages, you’ll be able to understand any story!

Because great writers, no matter how dense their sci-fi or fantasy world may be, use

these stages to help orient you.

I’m talking Dune.

Harry Potter.

Space Jam.

Number one, introduction in the ordinary world.

In Kingdom Hearts 1, this is when Sora, Riku, and Kairi are all just hanging out on Destiny

Islands, doing normal kid stuff.

Call to adventure.

What’s this?

Weird creatures showing up on the island?

Sora has a sword that’s also a key?

Refusal of the call.

Now we hit a bit of a hiccup here because he really does seem gung-ho to leave the island

at some point.

But I don’t think he wanted to do it on these terms, so I’ll still call this a refusal.

Meeting with the mentor.

At this point Sora is in Traverse Town, and he meets Leon, who ends up giving him some

guidance on what he’s supposed to be doing.

Crossing the threshold.

Or as true literary critics call it…

boarding the gummi ship.

Tests, allies, and enemies.

This is pretty much the entirety of the Disney worlds.

You’ll notice that a lot of times in these synopses of Kingdom Hearts,

people just skip over them.

It’s cause they all fit here.

Reaching the innermost cave.

This is such a pivotal moment in the story.

In Star Wars, this is when Luke goes into the cave and faces off against a shadow version

of himself.

And in Kingdom Hearts, this is when Sora goes into Hollow Bastion so he can fight Riku, who is

actually being possessed by Ansem, who is the Heartless version of Terra-Xehanort, who

was originally Terra but was then possessed by Xehanort before him.

Same thing.

Enduring the supreme ordeal.

After Sora has faced off against Ansem the first time, he has to stab his own heart with

a keyblade, so that way he can release it and save Kairi.

That’s a supreme ordeal.

Seizing the sword.

Now this is not a literal sword.

Obviously, Sora already has one of those.

But instead it’s the reward or the power that Sora can take with him.

So in this case, it’s him being resurrected, having all of the princesses of heart saved,

and having the power to defeat Ansem.

The road back.

Ansem has been defeated by Kingdom Hearts being opened and him being ripped apart by

the light.

And they are able to seal the doors, but unfortunately, they lose two of their friends in the process.

Resurrection.

Yeah, Sora did get literally resurrected a few stages before this.

Uh, but this is more of a metaphysical resurrection.

Them finally coming back from the brink.

Kairi going back to Destiny Islands.

Return with the elixir.

Sora, Donald, and Goofy all go back out, using their combined experience to try to save Mickey

and Riku.

And that's Kingdom Hearts!

That was pretty painless, don't you think?

But granted, that's not what people have an issue with.

People have an issue with all of the overarching story of Kingdom Hearts.

But, again, as long as we stick to these 12 stages, we should be able to take this apart,

piece by piece.

And though I am gonna stick with the 12 stages, I am gonna add just, uh, one little extra piece.

It's called historical background.

This is like The Silmarillion.

Or JK Rowling's twitter.

In Kingdom Hearts, this would be Union Cross, or Chi, or whatever the many names of this

web/mobile game ended up being.

Die-hard fans will get upset with me if I say this doesn't really matter to Sora's overarching story.

But I'm gonna say it anyway.

So this historical background is gonna just be up here.

And all of that knowledge is just gonna kind of bleed immediately into Kingdom Hearts 1.

Pat (offscreen): Uh, nope, you gotta do Birth by Sleep.

Pat: It's a prequel.

Brian: But, is Sora in it?

Pat: No.

No Sora.

Brian: Who's this guy, then?

Pat: That's Vanitas.

Brian: Why?

So I, uh, seem to have neglected, uh, like three other heroes' journeys in this hero's journey.

So I'm just gonna...

I'm gonna move these over a little bit so that way I can have a bit more space.

We, we do have to talk about Birth by Sleep.

Starting first with Terra's.

Um, now imagine it has all twelve of the stages of the hero's journey, I just didn't want

to write 'em all out, 'cause he gets norted, so he's not that good of a hero.

Same goes for Aqua, which is intersecting with Terra's.

And then we've got Ventus, who has the biggest bearing on Sora's hero's journey.

It means that it has to not only intersect over here with Terra and Aqua.

But, I'm sorry Vogler, I am gonna have to include another step on your hero's journey.

So here we've got the Ventus Diagram, uh, which intersects here at step point five.

The part of the hero's journey, uh, where the baby hero's heart goes and saves another boy.

That's the only big change we're gonna do to Vogler's story wheel.

Uh, everything else is gonna make sense in Kingdom Hearts.

And now we're going to take the wheel, uh, as if it is the overarching story of the entirety

of the games.

So Kingdom Hearts, the first one, instead of going from 1 all the way to 12, is actually

just gonna go from 0.5 to 5.

And then we start 5 immediately at Kingdom Hearts 2, which will begin with Sora...

Pat (offscreen): Nope.

Brian: What do you mean nope?

Pat: There's two more.

Once again I seem to have neglected a few, uh, interstitial pieces of Kingdom Hearts.

Chain of Memories and also three five eight days over two.

Which is a totally normal title.

It's totally fine, because it just fleshes out Sora's hero's journey.

And also... a different guy and his name is Roxas.

*pained expression*

I went ahead and I categorized Chain of Memories as a "hero's journey redux"

since Sora is just fighting against his own memories, the things that he has remembered

from the past hero's journey.

So it's just gonna hang out around here.

And then we have 358/2 Days, which follows Roxas, who is Sora's Nobody.

And a Nobody is like the shell of a person after they've released their heart.

358/2 Days happens then, and since it's the hero's Nobody, it's actually within the hero's

journey, doing its own thing.

Um, and, I'm gonna call this 4.5 remix.

This is a pivotal part of the hero's journey when, uh, the hero's shadow self goes off

and eats ice cream.

These two are tied together by a character named Xion, who works in Organization XIII

with Roxas, and also is made from the memories... of Sora.

She doesn't really have like a hero's journey...

I'll just tie it out for you.

And since this oblong actually crosses through the hero's journey twice, we're gonna make

this easy to remember and call it the

"Hero's Memories of the Hero's Journey Double Cross Oblong."

Or HMHJXXO.

In Kingdom Hearts 2, we start out with Roxas and Sora, and Roxas is on summer vacation.

We're gonna have him start over here and just kind of go all the way up to enduring the

supreme ordeal, where he finally gives up his body to Sora so Sora can be whole.

And we're just gonna call that "The Antihero's Cradle."

Alright, so, we're done with Roxas, we're back with Sora.

So this should be a breeze.

Kingdom Hearts 2.

Alright, he's already crossed the threshold.

He does the tests, allies, and enemies.

That's just the Disney stuff, we're gonna skip it.

He goes over, reaches the innermost cave, that would be the World that Never Was, where

he faces off against the supreme ordeal.

Xemnas, Organization XIII.

Seizes the sword.

He gets the power to close Kingdom Hearts.

And then finally, the road back.

They get home.

They get a letter from King Mickey, the contents of which will be revealed in...

Kingdom Hearts 3?

Pat (offscreen): No.

FUCK!

ALRIGHT ASSHOLES.

I have no more space here, so I made you a DATA CUBE.

ARE YA HAPPY?

The data cube contains the entirety of Kingdom Hearts Coded, which is all in a virtual space.

The data cube is that thing where the hero goes on a journey into his inner thoughts

and finds some data that an old guy put in him.

It's that THING THAT HAPPENS IN THE HERO'S JOURNEY.

And then at the same time, we also have Dream Drop Distance, which... is another hero's

journey inside of the hero's journey, and it's part of seizing the sword.

Because they have to go... into sleeping versions of the world's they've already been to.

But also maybe they're... they're going into each other's dreams?

And one of them is...

No, it doesn't fit here, I've got a better...

There's another part of the hero's journey, and it's called the Dream Drop Bucket.

And it's where you put the Dream Drop Distance until you need it later, and hopefully you won't.

That brings us up to Kingdom Hearts 3.

Granted, I thought when I started this, I would be able to...

perfectly predict, uh, Kingdom Hearts 3.

But, I don't know, I feel like I"m just missing something.

*CAUSE He GeTs NOrTEd.*

*BeING POsESSed bY AnSEM.*

*By XeHAnORT.*

*CAUSE HE GETS NORTED.*

I forgot about the villain's journey.

The villain's tridecagon.

The villain's tridecagon is definitely the key.

The tridecagon of villainy.

This is a 13-sided shape that goes one further than dodecagon of the hero's journey.

We have almost entirely ignored Xehanort.

He is the impetus for all of the anger and anguish in Sora's life.

And so he deserves a wheel as well.

We have to start at the very beginning of Xehanort.

And that starts in stage one of all villains.

You have to be contacted by a future version of yourself.

That brings us to stage two.

It gives you the ability to time travel.

And that's what this means.

This special string just shows that they can go wherever they want to in time.

Step three, you need to learn about a great power.

This is when Xehanort first discovers Kingdom Hearts and all of the power it could hold.

What do you do after you find out about that power?

You nort a boy.

Once you've got that boy under your possession, time to get real into unethical science.

That's when you're going to learn all about Kingdom Hearts and how to release people's hearts.

That means you can become a guinea pig yourself, therefore creating two versions of yourself.

A Nobody and a Heartless.

But are you happy with just those two versions of yourself?

You shouldn't be!

'Cause you're a villain.

That's right, it's time for nort boy redux.

Stage eight.

This is when Ansem, the Heartless version of Terra-Xehanort, the original norted boy

form, takes control of Riku.

And now that you're jazzed and ready to go, time to fail.

You do have to fail once, uh, in order to succeed later as a villain.

But don't let that failure get you down, it's time for stage 10.

You develop an organization to trick young boy into committing Heartless genocide in order to create

a new pseudo version of that great power you discovered back in stage three.

And then you fail again.

But guess what!

It's time travel time.

Your young self is gonna help you out by coming from over in step two to step 12.

You just do the same tenth step again, except instead of using other people, you use 13

versions of your own self.

Which leads us to the thirteenth point in the tridecagon.

The villain's variable.

You're either gonna win, or you're gonna lose.

This is the thing that we were missing.

The villain's variable is what will tie together the rest of story.

It's what will help us understand what will happen in Kingdom Hearts 3.

And judging by the villain's tridecagon, I can say that I don't believe Sora will seal

away the darkness.

In fact I expect Xehanort to win...

by norting Sora.

And then think of the repercussions of this.

Donald will kill Goofy by throwing him off a dock.

Riku will start cutting his own bangs.

Kairi will continue to not matter.

It's so much more interesting.

It's the true way that this story should end.

And I think this is what people want.

This is the modern hero's journey.

The true thing that all stories should follow from here on out.

As Utada Hikaru would say: Simple and clean.

So the next time someone tells you, "I don't understand Kingdom Hearts!"

You say, "Hey Bucko.

I think what you don't understand is basic storytelling."

Basic storytelling.

Did that work?

I don't know.

Ask...

Aladdin.

Did the memo work?

Why don't you ask Sebastian the crab. *sings Under the Sea*

You nort a boy.

*laughing*

Pat (offscreen): Ohhh no. 
 2020-06-25 16:22:25,587 - DEBUG - file running:  *cheerful music*

Kirby!

This pink puffball has been sucking his way through the denizens of Dream Land since 1992.

He has his own games, manga, tv series, and toys.

It’s safe to say he’s one of Nintendo’s most trusted mascots.

But he should not be trusted.

The problem with Kirby is that he is simultaneously Nintendo’s simplest and most powerful creature.

Those two realities cannot coexist.

He is a life form with neither the ambition nor the intelligence to make decisions,

and yet the world bends to his will.

Although it appears that Kirby is just a vacuous pastel marshmallow,

there must be some hidden wisdom that grants him the power he wields.

There has to be.

Kirby’s incongruity is terrifying,

but that’s only because we are terrified of things we do not yet understand.

And today, we are going to understand.

"Scientia potentia est.” Knowledge is Power.

Humankind’s attempts to harness the powers of the natural world

come from intense research and understanding of those powers.

And yet Kirby is granted powers well beyond his station.

What powers, you ask? Allow me to show you.

I have created two columns here: Simplicity, and Power.

What Kirby is, versus What Kirby can do.

By mapping the dichotomy of these two columns, we can peel back the facade of Kirby’s simplicity,

and figure out what’s really going on.

Because, again, this is not normal.

Let’s begin with simplicity.

Most people know Kirby as that cute little round guy, but is there more to him?

According to official, canonical information:

no.

Does this sound like an apex predator?

Even a bear enjoys a satisfying back-scratch.

This sounds like the lowest form of life,

someone who is stuck on the base of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs.

He wakes up, eats his caloric intake for the day,

and falls asleep watching The Great British Bake Off.

And yet, over here on the power column...

The things Kirby eats are completely obliterated.

Not just converted into something else, completely gone.

Kirby only cares about eating and sleeping.

And yet, he gains no energy nor pleasure from consuming these things.

Instead, he just lets them disappear.

Gone from this plane of existence.

So…

what the fuck.

Kirby doesn’t speak a language beyond saying the words “Poyo,”

and “Hi!”

Kirby mostly communicates via body language and grunts.

Even toddlers are more communicative.

By all accounts, he is either incapable of, or uninterested in, speaking language.

And yet Kirby is an incredibly skilled technician.

We see Kirby piloting mechs, and if anime is to believed,

and I believe anime,

this can only be accomplished by gifted teens grappling with psychosexual ennui.

He can effortlessly turn himself into a fighter jet,

something that only the most skilled air force engineers have mastered.

How can he understand these complex mechanical processes,

without having the language skill to read a textbook

or the "I fucking love science" facebook page?

Kirby’s origins are vague.

Let me take a moment to move over to a different board so I can show you Kirby’s origin story.

There’s NOTHING HERE.

Very little is known about Kirby’s origin.

He has no canonical species. He has no canonical age.

Masahiro Sakurai, Kirby’s alleged creator,

has stated he does not remember how Kirby got his name.

Kirby was originally a placeholder sprite,

set to be replaced by something....

More!

But no. Kirby survived. Kirby came from nothing.

And Kirby is nothing.

Or is he everything.

Because Kirby can be anything.

His copy ability gives him the powers and appearance of any creature he consumes.

But copy is a misnomer.

He does not duplicate his enemies.

He assimilates and replaces them.

In Smash, he takes the power of his foes, and then the foe is released as a sign of respect.

But in every other iteration of Kirby, the thing he consumes is destroyed in the process.

Does he absorb their DNA? Does he absorb their memories?

Is he the keeper of their souls?

All of these abilities point to Kirby being intelligently designed, which we know is not the case.

Sakurai fucking woke up in a crop circle with the name “Kirby” carved into his arm.

Kirby has no emotional intelligence. No relationships.

In the anime, Kirby seems to harbor no ill will toward King Dedede or Escargoon,

his main two antagonists.

He faces baby birds and full battalions of soldiers with the same vacant grin.

He eats and destroys indiscriminately, but counts no one among his enemies.

But those who count him among theirs…

are cosmic horrors.

Look at this thing.

Look at this thing!

These celestial powers probably have wants and needs far beyond our human comprehension,

and yet they trouble themselves with the destruction of Kirby,

a barely living kickball.

What do they see in Kirby that scares them?

What could scare this?

And the final simple evidence, Kirby is shaped like a friend.

This was the opening of Kirby’s Adventure. Let me show you something.

What did you notice?

That’s right. For the entire time I was drawing this,

I WASN’T INTERROGATING the true nature of Kirby.

This quote is cute and simple and a blatant misdirection.

It is a patronizing errand is meant to keep people like me from uncovering the truth.

The truth that Kirby possesses infinite power.

And that is a quote.

Planet Robobot explicitly states that Kirby possesses infinite power.

Kirby can ride a star. Kirby can punch through a planet.

Kirby is the only being in the entirety of the universe that survived the Galeem cataclysm.

A circle survived.

THIS SURVIVED.

HOW?

*deep breath*

Now that we’ve addressed these two columns, it is time to bridge the gap.

How can we reconcile the two canonical truths of Kirby:

that he is both nothing and everything.

How can this sentient garbage bag accomplish so much?

Let me tell you...

I don’t know.

I literally have no clue how this dumb fucking orb can have so much power.

I have worked my whole life researching and gaining knowledge,

and this dipshit sphere sleeps all day and has powers that gods fear.

And that’s impossible.

It should be impossible.

There has to be an answer here and I don’t see it and that’s NOT FAIR.

If knowledge is power, then power should be knowledge,

and Kirby is everything and he should know everything,

and yet we know nothing!

I can’t think in here.

I’m going outside!

How do I get outside?

Kirby!

The mystery of this florid Dream Landian has baffled me,

but I've taken a few months, and I've collected my thoughts,

and I’m back in the studio to deliver my findings.

Kirby’s incongruity is terrifying, but that’s only because we are terrified of things we do not yet understand.

And today, for real,

we are going to understand.

If you’ll recall from our first exploration of the rosy nightmare,

the problem with Kirby is that he is both incredibly simple and incredibly powerful.

In the intervening five months, I’ve learned a few pieces of information that contradict a few of my points.

First, Kirby can speak a language.

There was a Drama CD released in Japan in 1994 where Kirby speaks full sentences.

But in this, he says that a phone is “mysterious” and he doesn’t know how it works.

And yet, he can pilot a mech.

Two, Kirby’s name does in fact have a backstory,

even if Sakurai was too fuckin' zooted to remember it.

Kirby was named after John Kirby, a lawyer who passed away last year,

who defended Nintendo’s right to copyright Donkey Kong back in the ‘80s.

But this doesn’t make the rest of Kirby's origin any less vague,

and it doesn't change the fact that a creature cannot possibly embody both of these truths.

But that’s the problem.

I’ve been thinking of Kirby as a creature.

Consider, for a moment, Moby Dick.

You might receive this book in your English class and say,

"Hell yeah! A big ol’ whale?

I can’t wait to see Ahab level up and hit that big boy right in his weak points.

And sure, he puts his harpoon up in Moby D’s flanks,

but spoiler alert!

Ahab gets got,

even though he’s been grinding for, like, years

and Pale Whale's just a dipshit fish with a thing for sailor feet.

And so you say this to Ms. Mahoney and she’s like,

“Brian, don’t you get it? The whale is a metaphor for…

something,”

and then you write that on your final exam and you pass the class.

This is what I like to call “The Bookman’s Bluff.”

It’s when an author creates something, and people are like,

“Hey, that doesn’t make sense,”

but then the author says,

“Well, it does make sense if you consider it’s actually a metaphor.”

Here, I believe that Sakurai is pulling a Bookman’s Bluff.

Kirby, like Moby Dick, doesn’t make sense as a creature,

but he will make sense as a metaphor.

So what does Kirby symbolize?

Let’s take a look at some common metaphors.

Let's start with the seven deadly sins since everyone and their mother is basing characters on them.

Unfortunately, none of them really make sense for Kirby.

Wrath, no way. Greed, he’s not in it for the money.

I'm gonna skip over lust.

You could make an argument for Gluttony because he eats a lot.

Sloth, he sleeps a lot. And Envy, he's constantly copying other people.

But he never does it with any malice. Kirby does these things haphazardly,

without any sense of what he's doing.

And then there’s Pride.

Now, pride is the sin from which all other sins arise,

and its punishment in hell is being broken upon the wheel,

but Kirby is a wheel, so that ain’t gonna work.

But Kirby might symbolize someone else’s pride...

The Hubris of Humanity.

Think about it.

Has humanity ever paused to consider that perhaps our endless consumption

may not be a good move for the world as a whole?

Have we altered our course or simply continued to eat and sleep and copy others

without any thought of the repercussions?

In fact, perhaps we can go one step further. Kirby is a metaphor for capitalism!

Does our capitalist society assimilate and destroy?

Absolutely!

Technical and cultural appropriation are two of capitalism’s most trusted tools.

When it comes to a lack of emotional intelligence,

capitalism makes people willing to suck in and obliterate anything,

friend or foe, nation or natural wonder, so long as it makes money.

Is capitalism’s enemy a cosmic horror?

What could be more cosmically horrifying to a capitalist society

than a guy called Marx.

KIRBY IS A METAPHOR FOR CAPITALISM.

Sure, capitalism can sometimes be more cruel in its intentions than Kirby can manage.

That is... I'll take that.

Uh, also, it sure as hell feels like it could burn out at any second,

so the infinite power thing: not 100% true.

Um, and,

very-it's a-it’s hard to describe capitalism as being shaped like a friend…

and the whole eating and sleeping only is...

it doesn’t really make sense 'cause we have a hyper fixation on productivity and that being tied to worth…

so that doesn't...

This is not a very good metaphor, is it?

In fact, most of these metaphors are bullshit.

Especially this one.

I thought I could take five months and pause and contemplate,

and then I'd come back, and I'd have the perfect explanation for the dichotomy of Kirby,

but nothing has changed.

This horrifying bolus slips through my fingers again.

Maybe I’m just not good at this...

Jenna, can you...

I need you to keep my papers and push pins safe. I’m gonna go away for awhile…

I'm gonna find Kirby.

Jenna: Okay. Good luck bud.

I went to the woods because I wished to front only the essential facts of Kirby.

I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life,

just as Kirby might suck a Waddle Dee into his gullet.

I’ve been at it for a while now.

Judging by the length of my beard, I’ve been living out here for 2, maybe 3 years?

There are no pin boards in the forest.

I don’t have three cameras to catch my every side glance.

They don't teach you th...

It’s just me. And nature,

which has reduced me to my base instincts.

I only care about finding food and shelter,

eating and sleeping.

I am become Kirby.

I wish I could say this has given me a clear mind, but no,

nature has broken me.

I am confounded by it.

And we are terrified of things we do not yet understand.

Kirby is nature!

...I thought, after spending my first day out in the woods.

Sure, nature’s origins are still murky,

and what is evolution if not a really, really slow form of Kirby’s copy ability?

*inhaling*

And much like Kirby, Nature is neither cruel nor kind:

it doles out boons and punishments indiscriminately.

For every delicious handful of berries,

it also gives a completely unrelated bout of diarrhea.

But it took me only a few days to realize that this was another dead end.

Nature doesn’t destroy matter, or possess infinite power,

and its enemy is not a cosmic horror,

it’s us.

I'm sorry for using so much paper.

So I went back to the proverbial drawing board and have been stuck there ever since.

Nature is still terrifying to me.

And it is certainly not shaped like a friend.

How can Kirby live like this and stay so joyful?

How can he only care about his base needs and conquer any enemies that come before him?

I can’t conquer anything,

not even the mystery of a character from a children’s game.

All I can do is tumble listlessly through the wood,

like a star spat from Kirby’s maw.

*waves crashing*

I awake one morning upon the shore of a strange sea.

I do not know where I am, nor how I came to be here.

The sea stretches endlessly in front of me,

revealing the gentle, Kirby-like curve of the planet,

and I finally understand.

I was so focused on investigating the inner machinations of this bulbous boy

that I never asked why I was investigating.

I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things to mean something,

but Kirby didn’t need an explanation,

I did.

There is no bullet point or fan wiki entry.

Kirby is not nature or a metaphor.

Kirby doesn’t need a dark backstory or a logical rationale.

Kirby is just Kirby.

As I stand here watching the waves lap against the sand

miles away from civilization,

I realize I’m not simply standing on the edge of the ocean, but the edge of the world.

A world I’ve accepted without knowing its hidden meaning.

Perhaps there is no hidden meaning.

Perhaps it’s better that way.

Perhaps it’s time for me to go home.

“First you draw a circle,

then you dot the eyes.

Add a great big smile,

and presto, it’s Kirby.”

Kirby is an extremely strong circle,

and that’s all the explanation I need.

Unfortunately,

the same CANNOT BE SAID FOR DIDDY KONG.

WHO GAVE HIM A GUN? DID HE BUILD THE JETPACK?

THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE, HE'S A MONKEY, WHAT IS HE...

*suit ripping* Ahhh yeah!

This is satisfying. If you get in on this, you want to...

Pat: Yeah.

Brian: Roll... just put that in a bunch of dirt right now.

I'm gonna roll around a little bit.

*you hear a bunch of scrounging around*

*shirt ripping* Brian: Ohhhh incredible!

Pat: Are we gonna ride on the train like this to Coney Island?

Brian: Yeah maybe! 
 2020-06-25 16:22:25,587 - DEBUG - file running:  Mario!

He can jump, he can dance,

and he can successfully avoid conviction for war crimes.

It seems like the only thing he can’t do is settle down and just enjoy life for a bit.

Mario has been cleaning up messes in the Mushroom Kingdom and beyond since 1981.

That makes him almost 40 years old.

Most 40-year-olds I know are paying off a mortgage, buying a Peloton,

and desperately trying not to become their parents.

But Mario is still out there,

grinding at the same job,

and also, every other job.

Doesn’t Mario deserve some time off?

Doesn’t he get a chance to kick up his heels?

Enjoy a tropical drink while visiting the ol’ timeshare?

And more specifically, hasn’t he made enough coins to let him coast for the rest of his life?

That’s why I’m here to give him a little financial advice…

*ding!*

And figure out when Mario can retire.

*chalk board wheeling in*

Thank you both.

Why should Mario retire?

You might say “Mario loves his job,

and when you love what you do, you never work a day in your life,”

but that's bullshit.

I love what I do, and let me tell you something…

I’ve worked some days.

*threatening bass noise*

I personally can’t wait to retire.

As soon as I hit 50, I'm gonna be out there on the beach,

pina colada in one hand, sci-fi novel in the other,

soaking up mother nature's cosmic rays.

But Mario has a history of risk-taking behavior, and

it's possible he's planning to live fast, die young, and leave a beautiful, beautiful corpse.

That said, he’s made it out of every scrape so far,

and ground pounding at age 86 is hard on the hips.

Mario needs a backup plan.

Now, I’m not here to tell Mario how to live his life

*ding*

but I can take a look at his finances

and figure out when he’ll have enough money to finally hand Peach his resignation letter.

Foolish ol’ me thought that I could just google “how much money do you need to retire”

and there'd be a link that says “a million bucks,”

but no.

Turns out that everyone needs a different amount to retire based on what you’re used to.

If you’re making millions every year, you’re gonna need a lot more to retire,

because how else are you gonna support your dipshit failson’s bad business ideas?

But with all of the retirement calculators online, I was getting a little overwhelmed,

so I decided to reach out to a qualified financial advisor.

- Hi, my name’s Nate Choe, I’m a certified financial planner with Northwestern Mutual,

and I basically help people answer questions about money.

- That’s exactly what I need you to do today.

This call is not about me, um, I feel like I’m in a great spot right now in terms of my finances,

but I have some worries about my good friend, Mario.

I was looking online to see if there was, like, just a number of money you need in order to retire,

and it turns out that that’s not a thing that exists.

How do I figure out how much money you need to retire?

- Yeah, yeah, um, there are a lot of different things that you’d need to know.

At the most basic level, you need to know how many years you’re going to spend in retirement.

So basically, when you’re gonna retire, and at what age you’re going to die.

- So I have know, I have to be able to, uh,

to just discern when I’m willing to croak, is what you’re saying.

- Exactly, yes, you have to calculate a death at some point.

- Alright. What if I’m never gonna die.

- *chuckling* Then you’re never going to be able to retire.

And then you’ll need to know how much money you’re going to spend every single month…

- Okay…

- And then Nate listed off a bunch of other very important pieces of retirement info

and I paid close attention.

- Got it, okay.

I figure out how much money he’s gonna need per month, and then I’ll work backward from that,

based on how much money he can accrue, and then that will be how I can figure out when he can retire?

- That work backwards model is actually what we do in the industry,

but we have to offset what he has against inflation as well.

- Is there a minimum amount of money per month that you suggest people have for retirement?

- Yeah, typically, what we’re talking about, like, the average American,

it’s going to be about three thousand dollars a month, of today’s dollars.

- I feel like Mario is a very humble man,

and so I don’t think he’s going to need more than 3k a month, um,

just to make it easier for me.

So now that I’ve got a basic gist of the information I need to calculate Mario’s retirement age,

it’s time to collect the information.

Let’s start with something easygoing

and figure out when Mario's gonna die.

To keep things simple, we’ll assume that Mario was born the year he first made a game appearance.

This might not be perfectly accurate, but it would make him almost 39 years old,

and that feels pretty right for a strangely smooth-skinned mustachioed man.

Though current male life expectancy is around 80 years old,

I personally can’t come to grips with the fact that Mario is halfway through his life,

so I’ll be generous and say he’ll die at 90.

He’s spry.

In order to retire, Mario is going to need a monthly budget of at least three thousand US dollars,

but he uses coins.

Tons and tons of people have tried to figure out, how much a coin would be worth in US dollars,

but most of them have been thinking about coins as a solid gold object.

Judging by the amount of coins you need to purchase simple objects in the Mushroom Kingdom,

it seems like coins are not really worth that much.

Using Super Mario RPG as our guideline for a coin’s purchasing power,

the cheapest items are a mushroom and able juice: 4 coins a pop.

Shirt and pants are the cheapest nonconsumable items at 7 coins each.

I wanted to compare these with the most expensive items in Super Mario RPG,

but I don’t think I can figure out the real world price of a fire bomb

without getting put on a watch list.

After doing some heavy research, I settled on a conversion rate of 1 coin to 8 US Dollars.

Given our 3k figure for retirement,

that just means Mario needs 375 coins a month, right?

WRONG.

Super Mario RPG came out in 1996, and we haven’t accounted for inflation.

That’s why we gotta compare these prices to similar items Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga,

which came out seven years later.

I built my Mushroom Price Index on these six items, and just from a cursory glance,

it’s obvious that the prices have gone up.

But to figure out by how much, we gotta head back to algebra two.

The pert equation!

It's something I learned about a very long time ago,

and I’m pretty sure it’s used to figure out compounding interest.

Basically, I gotta plug in some prices and do some natural logs and

whatever else the internet tells me to do,

and it will leave me with an annual inflation rate for that item.

Then I just gotta average out the rates and it’ll leave me with a workable annual inflation rate

for the Mushroom Kingdom as a whole.

So I’ll just go ahead and do that math in my head real quick.

*thinking music*

Thank you, Clayton.

Now, rounding that number up, that’s an average annual inflation rate of about 15% per year.

Which is… really high.

The US Federal Reserve tries to keep inflation at a healthy 2%,

whereas the Mushroom Kingdom Federal Reserve doesn’t exist

due to aggressive lobbying by Wario.

In order to understand this a bit better, I googled Mario hyperinflation,

and I got some exciting search results

that were ultimately unhelpful.

But from what I gather, this means that if Mario spends 100 coins to buy a shirt this year,

next year, he'll have to spend a little more than 115 for the same shirt.

If inflation stayed the same from when Superstar Saga came out in 2003,

we can assume that by 2020, a simple mushroom is going to cost 128 coins.

A pair of entry level pants will cost 2049 coins.

So that original 1-to-8 conversion rate doesn’t really make sense anymore.

Using those same 2020 price comparisons,

the conversion rate is more like 36 coins to 1 US Dollar.

If Mario retired today, he would need 108,000 coins per month.

*MAMMA MIA!*

But let’s remember that Mario has been doing this for a long time. He’s definitely got a little something...

... away. So I talked to Nate about his job and ways he might be saving money.

- He has a bit of a strange job. He’s technically a plumber, I guess, in title?

- Is he part of, like, the plumber’s union? Does he have a pension?

- So I, I, I would be willing to bet he doesn’t have a pension just because, uh,

I think he might be the only plumber?

He’s not being employed by anyone, necessarily. He’s just doing it and then finding his payment along the way.

- Okay, so it sounds like he’s almost, like, a freelancer.

If he’s not getting W-2 income he can’t save into things like 401ks or Roth IRAs.

- Now, when you say Roth IRA, what is that?

- It’s a way to save for retirement.

Um,

you know, as a young person you should definitely be doing one, trying to max it out every single year.

It’s crucial for, for retirement.

- When…

But when you say crucial, do you…

do you mean optional?

So, maybe Mario doesn’t have a Rough IRA or a 4-in-1 Cake or whatever,

but no one has those. I don’t, and I’m well on my way to that beach chair in Boca!

And the fact is that Mario can get a lot of coins in his games.

How else could he spend so much on go-karting and tennis?

In the most recent Mario games, the coin counter can only go up to 9,999,

which is the maximum amount you can store in a mattress.

So let’s assume that Mario has been saving 10,000 coins every year since the release of Mario Odyssey.

We can assume that since he’s not in a union, he isn’t getting any raises to offset inflation.

So to finally figure out when Mario can retire, we need to know much money he’ll need every year before his death.

For example, if he lives to 90 years old, he’ll need 2.7 billion coins.

Which is the cost of living for just one year.

But we have to remember that he's been saving 10,000 coins for 54 years,

which means that he would have 540 thousand coins saved up… Which is…

point zero two percent

of what he needs to retire for just one year before his death.

And actually, if the monthly cost of living is already 108 thousand coins,

he's gonna be unbelievably deep in debt…

Which is actually what Nate told me, via text.

Mario can never retire.

You know what, that’s bonkers though, because there's...

there’s no way that, you know, inflation's gonna stay that high for that long.

In fact, in later Mario and Luigi RPGs, the prices are the same or lower.

So let’s just assume that from here on out the inflation rate stays a healthy 2%.

And you know what, let’s assume that Mario can save more than 10,000 coins a month.

In New Super Mario Bros. 2, the counter maxes out at one less than 10 million coins.

Granted, this is an outlier, and a ridiculous one at that,

but so is spending 2.7 billion coins just to survive at age 90.

There’s no way you could spend that much on Werther’s Originals.

So let’s say he's saving 10 million coins a year since age 31,

which, might I point out, is over a quarter of a million US Dollars.

Now if we just add up the cost of living of each year leading up to 90,

we can see that Mario will have saved enough money to chill out on his boat at age…

77.

Which is...

is just one year below the average American male life expectancy…

*I'M-A TIRED!*

Okay, you know what,

just for fun, let's just throw some random numbers in here, just to... just for...

just to see, you know, just wheaa- just for fun!

Let’s say Mario is starting to save money at, ppffff, I don’t know, my age, 26.

The inflation rate can stay the same, 2%,

and let's just say that the coin ratio is actually just 1-to-1 with US dollars,

so just he needs 3,000 coins today in order to retire.

And, and you know what, let’s, let's say he can save….

uhhh, psshhh, 10% of an average video producer’s salary in New York City.

Something completely random like that.

Assuming Mario lives to the ripe old age of 90,

we can just plug these figures into the equation

and figure out that Mario will be kickin' back on the white sands,

boombox blastin' Jimmy Buffett at the youthful retirement age of...

88?

Are you fucking kidding me?

Nononono... That can’t be right…

Because if Mario can’t retire,

then that would mean that I wo-

*uncomfortable silence*

Will you excuse me for a moment…

*tropical music playing in the background*

*Another day in paradise!*

*The sun is shining bright!*

*People laugh and people smile, 'cause everything feels alright!*

In order to understand this a little better, I googled Mario hyperinfla- *laughing* I just,

I'm sorry, I'm just accepting this now. I'm just accepting what I'm saying. 
 2020-06-25 16:22:25,588 - DEBUG - file running:  The Mega Man robot masters were not always evil.

In fact, most were mechanized workers, created specifically to make life on Earth more efficient

and wonderful.

AND THEN THAT MASSIVE DONGER,

DR. WILY, TURNED ‘EM ON US!

So Mega Man destroyed them, and the world was saved.

But... just how useful were these robots?

And were they useful enough to chance a robot uprising?

What if someone ranked every single Mega Man robot master from most to least useful to

see which ones were really worth the risk.

Someone should try to do that.

It’s me.

I’m the one who’s going to do that.

Before I get started on the gradient of worth it to not worth it, I’m gonna talk

about the protagonists, or “the good guys” even though some of them aren’t specifically good.

A lot of these robots were built to be sentient for the sake of being sentient, and I do not

feel at all qualified to discuss the philosophical implications of that.

So I’m gonna put ‘em over here.

Mega Man.

Mega Man X.

Mega Man red.

They’re all over here.

I’m not gonna touch that.

So what kind of robots are good when they’re sentient?

I think that it’s things humans cannot do.

Things that perhaps only a robot could do.

One that can think for itself would be pretty worthwhile.

So let’s start with those ones.

The ones that are good.

Number one: Chill Man.

Chill Man is a recent robot master who was built to help stop global warming.

And heaven knows we need that.

Definitely worthwhile.

Next is another cold friend: Freeze Man.

Freeze Man was built to make a non-polluting energy.

He would make that energy by splitting average temperatures

into hot temperatures and cold temperatures.

I’m choosing to think of that as something like nuclear fission as opposed to choosing

to think of it as dumb.

Commando Man.

Terrible name, but he was actually a minesweeping robot.

One of the first gens, Elec Man.

He controlled nuclear power plants.

He could help make sure the nuclear power plant was shut down in case anything bad ever

happened to one.

Hopefully it won’t!

SsssssSTAR MAN!

He was built to explore the universe.

Humans are real squishy, really, when you think about it.

It might be nice to have a man going out into the stars, a Star Man.

Also in his flavor text, he’s apparently a romantic and, like, loves poetry, and that’s

what we need out in the stars.

While he’s up there, Galaxy Man is helping figure out the trajectories.

Splash Woman!

She’s super useful because she goes and helps shipwrecked sailors, or just people

lost at sea.

I feel like she’d do a better job than, I dunno, the Coast Guard or whatever.

Not that I’m shitting on the Coast Guard.

They do do good…

I’m digging myself in a hole.

Wait, where’d Toad Man go?

*worry about Toad Man*

Where’s my guy Toad Man?

Toad Man.

He irrigates crops during drought.

Very useful.

Why’d they make him a toad?

Ice Man.

I swear we’ve got a lot of cold people up here at the front.

He’s built specifically to do human-like tasks in cold weather.

So he’s good!

More cold friends.

Blizzard Man.

There to help monitor the weather in arctic environments.

Looks and names can be deceiving, and Junk Man is super important.

Junk Man was built so he could find useable robot parts that have been left out.

Think about how much electronic waste we make.

It would be great if something could go dig through all of our trash and find the useable

circuit boards.

That’s important.

Hornet Man.

We’ve done some shit to bees y’all.

He pollinates the flowers.

Would be very useful if we continue to keep doing shit to bees.

And finally, we’ve got Cloud Man and Tornado Man.

They both are actually useful for, uh, controlling the weather when things are bad.

I’m gonna put Cloud Man in front of Tornado Man because Tornado Man, uh, was, was built

to stop tropical storms.

Which is not what a tornado is.

He needs a different name.

There we go.

These ones I would say are worth the risk.

We still have like 180 more to go.

We got a bunch of construction robots next.

We’ll start with everyone’s favorite: Guts Man.

Imagine there’s a line right here.

Maybe I’ll put it in in after effects.

That might be too much work.

I’m probably not gonna do that.

Good ones.

Now we’re into construction zone.

Guts Man comes first because he’s a civil engineer.

He’s not only strong and can lift big rocks, but he can build bridges probably.

We’ve got Aqua Man and Pump Man.

Both of them are used for water filtration.

I’m gonna put Aqua Man in front of Pump Man because Pump Man’s flavor text explains

that sometimes he’ll volunteer to wash off graffiti,

and no one likes a narc.

Bomb Man: bombs.

Ground Man: excavation.

Block Man: makes blocks.

Concrete Man: concrete.

Needle Man: needles.

I guess it’s drilling.

Drill Man: also drilling.

Bit Man, from the DOS game.

He is also a driller.

You think that after the first two went bad… they would’ve stopped making drill robots,

right?

Oil Man DOS.

He does oil… things.

Hard Man.

*trying to keep it together*

He doesn’t actually have a, um, flavor text explanation for what he is other than that

he is very heavy.

So I am assuming that he is for ground leveling.

Um.

But maybe he’s just big?

Impact Man: piling.

Cut Man: tree cutting.

Torch Man DOS: welding.

Fuse Man: electrical equipment management.

Oil Man: keeping things oiled.

Spark Man: making sparks!

I think he actually charges things.

Fire Man.

He was made to incinerate trash.

Bond Man.

He was supposed to be in the first game until they realized… he was just glue.

Stone Man.

I assume bricks, but actually they only say that he hangs out with Guts Man, so maybe

he’s just moral support.

Flame Man.

He generates thermal power.

But also he’s powered by thermal power?

Which seems recursive.

And also impossible.

Jewel Man.

He not only mines the jewels but he polishes them.

Finally, in the construction, it’s Slash Man.

He was specifically made to cut down trees so that you could build SECRET bases.

I don’t know why they insisted on saying it was for secret bases.

That seems like a waste of a robot.

To be perfectly honest, I don’t think we needed to make these ones sentient, because

you know what, Hard Man?

I think steamrollers were doing just fine.

Now we’re getting into a category I like to call…

Sure???

They’re not necessarily bad.

I just think we could probably do without Wind Man, who apparently helps with the harvest…

with fans.

Astro Man, who just works in a planetarium.

Gravity Man.

He can control gravity which could be useful?

Dive Man.

He was built to catch fish with torpedoes.

They made him look like a submarine and they gave him torpedoes.

Feel like they should’ve seen this coming.

Solar Man.

Now he investigates solar things, I guess.

He also apparently developed an exercise routine.

I don’t know why they needed to put that in the flavor text, but it definitely put

him in the “Sure???” category.

Top Man.

I’ll give ya…

I’ll give you a guess about what he does.

Did you guess “explore other planets?”

Because yeah, that’s what he was designed for.

Why the FUCK is he a top?

God these are all so good.

We’re getting into the categories where I can’t stop laugh…

*clears throat* *deep breath*

Serious.

Snake Man.

*laughter from everyone in the studio*

He, uh, was supposed to explore other planets

that had crevasses.

And he’s a snake.

Gyro Man.

He was supposed to be a really good plane, but then Wily ran out of money, so they just

stuck a propellor on his back.

Plant Man manages plants.

Pharaoh Man.

Only supposed to explore ruins.

Blast Man.

He manages fireworks.

Fireworks are dangerous.

Don’t play with fireworks.

But also, maybe, don’t make a robot to play with them.

I love Nitro Man.

I’m gonna be honest, I do feel kind of bad putting him into the “Sure???” category.

Uh, because Nitro Man was built specifically to do motorcycle stunts in movies.

The thing I really love about Nitro Man is that he’s the president of a stunt robot club.

Which I think is just wonderful.

He’s still not useful.

Here’s where thing get a little bit difficult for me.

Burst Man was built to be a guard.

I’m not sure about robot, highly armed guards.

But since he was specifically a guard…

I keep saying specifically.

I figure, like, that’s still defensive, and so…

I’ll put him here.

But it’s a good segue!

In the Mega Man games, not every robot was made by Dr. Wily or Dr. Light.

And in fact, there were some robots that were made by other robots.

Or were made extraterrestrially.

Or were made specifically as a joke, like “I can’t find my keys, man!”

I’m gonna put them kind of as the split in the middle to say, “Hey, these are nebulous,

but they’re definitely not good.”

Now that we’ve got this hard line of good to bad, even though, to be honest, I think

that the line should be here.

It’s time for us to talk about the bad robots.

J.J. Abrams.

Some of these robots were built specifically to murder.

We can all agree that that is bad.

I’m gonna put all of these murder robots over on the very bad side.

We also have a bunch of characters that are Sonic robots.

That is an affront to nature.

They’re in the bad side, too.

I also didn’t even print out all of the NetNavis from Mega Man Battle Network even

though I love those games because those were software built with the specific intention

of being mean online.

And that’s just Twitter.

I do just want to point out Aircon Man, who was a robot sent from the future to destroy

the world.

And he’s also an air conditioning unit.

Now *kick* let’s get into the fun part.

These robots have absolutely no reason to be sentient.

Chemistry Man.

He’s from the new cartoon.

He apparently taught chemistry classes that were so boring, he put kids to sleep.

And then he took it really personally, and decided to become evil.

Sheep Man.

He’s a shepard actually.

Tundra Man.

Built to do similar things to all of the high echelon frozen people, but I’m including

him over here because he got really bored at his job and then decided to become

an ice skater.

This is why you don’t make sentient robots, I guess.

Hypno Woman.

She was a therapist who hypnotized people into bad things.

DJ Jazzy J4-8950…

is a boombox.

You are a magnet.

Plug Man charged electrical things.

Like a plug could do.

Strike Man sounds cool, but he’s just a baseball throwing machine.

It’s me.

Spring Man can… jump?

Bright Man.

Built to explore dark places.

Kinda like a FLASHLIGHT.

Cold Man’s a refrigerator.

Seriously.

Sword Man.

He was developed to hold a sword that Wily stole from a place.

He’s not a sentient murder robot.

He’s a sentient picture frame.

Things that don’t really need to be sentient?

A vacuum.

It’s Dust Man.

Although, Dust Man is quoted as saying, “Don’t let me suck more than I can handle!”

So you know what, actually, I take this back.

He’s more important than Chill Man.

We’ve already done the worthwhile ones.

We’ve talked about the construction ones.

We’ve talked about the ones that are “eh whaat uh sure w-okay thas fine.”

We have all of the ones that are alien.

And we’ve got the ones that really didn’t need to be sentient.

We are left with the dregs of robotic society.

I call this category…

NO.

We’ll start with Crystal Man.

He was built to make crystals so that Dr. Wily could sell them for money.

Turbo Man is a car.

Or rather, he used to be a car, but then he was turned into turbo man.

Charge Man.

Is he a train?

No.

But he’s meant to camouflage as one.

I think Dr. Wily’s just real into trains.

You know what I think about when I think of “Safety Operations Manager?”

A big man full of magma.

Built to make sure a plant kept safe, but also had a bunch of cauldrons full of boiling

magma in him.

Time Man.

He’s a time machine.

That never goes well.

Acid Man was built to be a chemist.

What’s he good for, titrations?

That's a chemistry joke.

Centaur Man.

He... was a tour guide.

Just hire a 16 year old.

Like, they need the job.

Shark Man DOS.

Shark Man DOS not need to exist.

Oh we’ve been doing this for like five hours.

*CLAP CLAP*

Goddamnit.

Magic Man was built to be a magician in like a traveling circus sort of show.

And then he was not turned evil, he just decided to conscript in King’s army because he wanted

to show off.

Here’s the big rule of thumb:

magicians are always evil.

Shade Man.

He looks like a vampire, doesn’t he?

It’s ‘cause he was built to look like one.

He was an animatronic robot in a haunted house.

Somebody thought we should make that creepy animatronic robot sentient.

PHEW remember how Centaur Man was a tour guide?

Well so was Dynamo Man.

But they also made him constantly shoot off electricity.

That’s a bad tour guide.

When they got into, like, the late game stages, they were just like, “I dunno, he’s a

tour guide for a thing.”

Torch Man was built to teach kids about fire safety in the woods.

Which is kind of like if Smokey the Bear

was CONSTANTLY ON FIRE.

You thought torch man was bad, let me tell ya about Burner Man, who was made, and I quote,

“to bring harm to natural environments.”

Technically not murder.

Definitely bad.

Remember how I said that a lot of these guys were tour guides?

Well let me tell you about Blade Man.

Built to show off an old castle full of swords.

And also was a sword.

Tengu Man.

Makes typhoons.

HOOOKAY.

We’re at the final three here.

We’ve made it.

And I’d say that these three really hammer home the point

that we should not be making sentient robots.

We’ve got Pirate Man.

Not a murder robot.

But was built to do pirate things, like steal from other ships.

He does look cool as hell, though.

The second to last robot is not actually a terrible robot idea.

But it is a testament to just how trash human beings are.

Bounce Man was built to be a crash test dummy.

Some asshole thought, “Hey, you know that thing we throw against a wall,

many miles-per-hour,

every single day,

multiple times a day?

You know what would make that better?

IF IT COULD FEEL PAIN.”

WHAT?

Luckily, Bounce Man bounced from that job and then became an exercise instructor.

Humans are trash.

Finally, we’ve come to number one.

Clown Man.

Who has ever watched a clown and thought to themselves,

“Boy,

I wish that thing never got tired!"

Clown Man is terrible, and I’m not saying that clowns are terrible.

Okay?

Clowns serve their purpose.

They’re creepy.

Sometimes good.

And…

You know what, I do take that back, clowns don’t serve a purpose.

That’s it.

All 200+ Mega Man robot masters, of which 15 are kind of okay.

Elon Musk: don’t get any ideas.

This is what man has wrought.

You will see these men in your nightmares.

Particularly,

Spring Man.

Jumping around.

 2020-06-25 16:22:25,588 - DEBUG - file running:  Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.

A game that takes heroic and villainous characters and forces them to form fraternal bonds in

the crucible of battle.

Because for those who can superbly smash, there is no better place to make a friend

than on the battlefield.

That’s the battlefield?

Seriously?

How did they get permits for that?

That’s irresponsible.

Hi, I’m Brian David Gilbert, safety fan and bureaucratic wunderkind, please address

me as such, and I’ve spent the last week and a half poring over the regulations of

the United States Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration,

also known as OSHA.

I’m here to hold Super Smash Bros. to account.

Because when you take 70-plus beloved characters and force them to fight for our entertainment,

the least you can do is make sure the buildings are up to code.

So let's go ahead and FIND EVERY OSHA VIOLATION IN EVERY STAGE IN SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE.

First, let’s explain the process, we have to start by choosing the correct regulations,

and unfortunately, there isn’t a OSHA guide to “bloodsport,” so we're just gonna go

with construction, form 1926. 'Cause that's close enough.

The main thing to point out here is 1926.10 subsection A. I’ll read an excerpt for you

so you can understand the basic concept of this video, and also the hellscape I had to slog through

the past week: “no contractor or subcontractor contracting for any part of the contract work”

— that’s a real line — “shall require any laborer or mechanic employed in the performance

of the contract to work in surroundings or under working conditions which are unsanitary,

hazardous, or dangerous.”

Basically, we’re here to build a safer experience for these characters, because when you walk

into an unknown space, I want the first question on your mind to be:

There are roughly 350 regulations in form 1926.

How many pages is that?

About 684.

Don’t worry, this is... this is just a visual aid.

They're all blank.

I wouldn't waste paper like that.

*thinks of the times he's wasted paper*

Most of these regulations are irrelevant, but I

still had to read all 684 pages in order to know which ones to cut.

Which reminds me, this video idea came from commenter nshady16, so if you have an Unraveled

idea, why don't you go ahead and leave me a comment.

And thanks, nshady16, for making me read 684 pages of OSHA regulations,

you piece of garbage.

So I cut out all of the regulations that were just definitions, unrelated to stages, nonmandatory,

redundant, or about personnel safety, because again, we’re not talking about hard hats,

we're talking about the stages themselves.

Unfortunately, this also meant I had to cut out the entirety of subsection R.

Steel Erection.

So there goes like 80% of the jokes in this video.

Out of those 350 regulations, we’re left with 46 that actually relate to Smash Bros. stages.

And again, we're just using the 103 stages you get when you boot up Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.

Any any secret stages that pop up later, uh, that's probably just an underground fighting

ring, which is a different form of illegality.

I’m gonna explain all of these OSHA violations as we go along.

But I just want you to keep in mind that there is a maximum penalty of $12,934 per OSHA violation.

We’ll get into that later.

Let's get these OSHA violations on the board.

BAM!

That's all the OSHA regulations we'll be discussing today.

Let's start with the codes that pretty much every stage violates.

General safety and health provisions.

I threw these three here because they're just dangerous in general and they don't have that

many other specific violations.

Safety training and education.

Seems like most of these people don't have safety training.

Especially in Moray Towers, where they literally shoot guns at you as you fly into the stage.

Recording and reporting of injuries.

Wii Fit Studio is a gym, and so I would expect it to have paperwork if one of the gym members

gets injured.

Unfortunately, all of the gym members get injured.

Means of egress.

In most places, you have to have exit signs.

And also, you have to have exits that don't involve plummeting to your death.

Employee emergency action plans.

It's very important to have an emergency action plan.

Especially if that emergency action plan is for if a mountaintop breaks off and slides

into the ocean.

Look at this polar bear!

He has no fuckin' clue what's going on!

Accident prevention, signs, and tags.

Just put one wet floor sign anywhere, and I'll let it slide, okay?

Duty to have fall protection.

I mean uh... there's no fall protection.

How hard is it to put a harness on someone?

General requirements for stairways and ladders.

Anything above 19 inches of elevation needs a staircase or a ladder.

Not everyone can double jump.

Sanitation.

Most of sanitation deals with potable versus non-potable water.

But a lot of it also deals with toilets, and I have yet to find a Smash Bros. stage that

includes a restroom.

And I need to know where Donkey Kong pees.

So those ones pretty much everyone gets wrong.

Which means that we're at about 900 violations already.

Yikes!

I feel a bit bad hitting all of these stages so hard, so I'll be a bit lenient for 1926.50.

Medical services and first aid.

You have to provide first aid if someone has been hurt.

And I'll just let the max tomato fulfill that requirement.

451 states that you can't be using unstable objects as scaff.

I'm gonna call all of these scaff 'cause there's no OSHA guideline for levitating floors.

Jumping on an awning causes it to break in Onett.

That's totally irresponsible.

452 states that you need to have cross bracing.

Kongo Falls has so many things that aren't cross braced.

453 is all about aerial lifts.

You need to stand firmly on the ground while it is moving.

Stop jumping!

Housekeeping.

You gotta clean out the debris.

I don't care that you've got a big dog running around behind you... put the... put the blocks

away, that's debris!

Put your toys away, honey!

Occupational noise exposure.

I'm ignoring the fact that they're fighting on top of a jet and instead thinking about

how loud those jets are.

Pop some earplugs in!

Gases, vapors, fumes, dusts, and mists.

All of these stages have clouds that you can stand on.

Which means they're incredibly dense.

I don't care what it's made of, you shouldn't be breathing that in.

Illumination.

Those torches don't do anything.

I'm gonna trip and stub my toe.

Ventilation.

A lot of these stages need more airflow, better ventilation, but in Pictochat 2, there is

too much ventilation in the form of this man who blows air.

Who hired this man?

I don't want him on my job site.

Hazardous waste operations and emergency response.

In Flat Zone X, someone spills oil and then just leaves it there.

1926.150, 151, 152, and 154 are all about fire protection.

Most of these regulations are pretty self explanatory.

You need to have a fire extinguisher.

It needs to be readily available.

You can't have ignition hazards hanging around.

You can't store more than 25 gallons of a flammable liquid in one place.

By the way, I'm including magma as a flammable liquid.

I know they mean petroleum substances, but I think that's just a lack of imagination

on OSHA's part.

But 154 is all about temporary heating devices and how they shouldn't be kept in enclosed spaces.

Kind of like the charmander at the top of Saffron City.

The general requirements of electrical equipment.

They should be kept free from hazards that could cause death or harm to employees.

The large airships flying around you in these stages are not only electrical equipment,

but they are designed to harm and kill you.

Violation.

Specific purpose equipment and installations.

This is all about elevators and escalators.

WarioWare Inc. is one big elevator.

You don't need me to tell you it's broken.

Helicopters.

Is a Shy Guy a helicopter?

I think so.

You're not supposed to be working underneath hovering craft.

Even if they're bringing you fruit.

Conveyors.

That includes the stages that move back and forth and also all of the scrolling stages,

which are the fastest way to die in Super Smash Bros. Tools and material shall be secured

to prevent movement.

Don't move equipment unless it's safe.

They're on a live racetrack.

All of the things are moving.

Marine operations and equipment.

You have to have a lifering on a barge, and you have to provide a walkway between wharfs

and boats.

Paper Mario dissolves into a boat, but that doesn't count as a walkway.

And there is not a single lifering at the Donkey Kong residence.

I don't care how good you are at surfing, FUNKY KONG.

Underground construction.

If you're working underground, you're required to have a five-person rescue team on call.

And although Super Smash Bros.

Ultimate does allow up to eight players.

None of them will save you.

Working on or near exposed energized parts.

Does a pokemon count as an energized circuit?

According to OSHA, yes.

1926.1052 is all about stairways.

If you have a stairway that rises more than 40 inches, you need to have a handrail.

I imagine that Mario is about 40 inches tall, and this is at least four or five times his height.

Violation.

Violation.

VIOLATION.

VIOLATION!

Confined spaces.

These are places where you are building where it's hard to get in and out of.

You need to specify the acceptable entry conditions.

There are no acceptable entry conditions into a space with a pit full of acid.

Disposal of waste materials.

If you are dropping waste materials more than 25 feet, you need to be putting it in a chute.

Clock Tower: it is all debris that is falling infinitely.

And it SHOULD be in a chute.

850 is about preparing the demolition building.

You're supposed to remove any glass that could break.

And in Dracula's Castle, Death flies through the window and breaks the glass.

I couldn't give a shit about Death, you should've removed that stained glass first.

853, you can't have a aggregate of more than 25% of a floor destroyed, and in Find Mii,

he destroys half of the stage.

The manual removal of floors.

You can destroy a lot of things in Shadow Moses Island, but you shouldn't be standing

under them.

Tower cranes.

There is only one stage that violates this.

It's literally the only stage with a tower crane, and ya FUCKED IT UP!

Explosives should be stored in a magazine when they're not in use.

And in Wrecking Crew, they're just available for you to punch until they explode.

Firing the blast.

You shouldn't be in the proximity of the blast.

Nor should you be in the barrel that is causing the blast and shooting you off into space.

1926.53 and 54 are about different types of radiation.

Ionizing, which is nuclear, and non-ionizing, which is like lasers.

Final Destination is just flying around through random parts of space.

There is no protection.

You should be less worried about getting punched into oblivion and more worried about the cancers.

In Gamer, your mom fires lasers at you when she sees you gaming.

I'm not here to discuss her qualifications, but you are not allowed to fire those lasers

at employees.

JUST LET ME GAME, MOM!

Ladders.

Suzaku Castle?

You thought you could get away with that shitty-ass ladder?

Those ladder rungs need to be uniform.

They need to be evenly spaced.

They need to not be broken.

I know that ladder is there for aesthetic purposes, but THAT IS A VIOLATION, SUZAKU

CASTLE.

YOU CANNOT HIDE YOUR LADDERS FROM ME.

That leaves us with one stage.

The one that has violated the most regulations.

But I want to point out Boxing Ring.

The only stage that is OSHA compliant.

It's almost as if it was built to allow people to fight in it safely.

Sakurai, I know you worked so hard on this game, and I appreciate it so much, but you

could have stopped at just one stage.

You SHOULD have STOPPED at JUST ONE STAGE.

Finally, weighing in at 23 OSHA violations, it's 75m.

I'm not 100% sure if this had so many violations just because it is a construction site, so

it was easier for me to find all of the flaws with it.

Obviously, Brinstar is probably more dangerous, but I don't know how to categorize Mother Brain.

The thing that pushed it over the edge was material hoists, personnel hoists, and elevators.

They need to be enclosed at all times.

People can just jump on and off of these material hoists over there.

That's so irresponsible.

There's fire.

There are jacks that get thrown across the stage.

There is a large ape.

Again, I could not categorize that, but I know he shouldn't of been there! 75m is the

most OSHA violating stage in Smash Bros.

And if you have to get rid of one of them, that's the one you should get rid of first,

and then you should get rid of the rest of them, too.

Because, again, OSHA does not stop after one stage.

Let's remember back to the beginning of this video when I talked about violation penalties.

I mentioned that every serious violation of OSHA is $12,934 in fines.

I forgot to mention that every repeated or willful violation is $129,336 per violation.

I am going to pretend that I found all of these violations on the same day, and that

they didn't have a chance to fix them all, so therefore they are not repeated.

But that's still 1,317 violations.

Or $17,034,078 in fines.

Which is why I am sending you this video, Masahiro Sakurai.

Surely you can't afford 17 million dollars in fines.

I'm willing to let bygones be bygones.

OSHA doesn't need to hear about all of this evidence I've compiled.

All you must do is send me 50 US dollars.

I'm in a real tough situation right now and I just need to get through the month.

Please.

Also you could send me Kirby's phone number.

I know he is real.

Where are you hiding him?

And I have yet to see a Super Smash Bros. stage that includes a toilet.

And I need to see where Donkey Kong pees.

*Pat & Brian laughing* And I need to know where Donkey Kong Pees.

Oh god I was so close!

And I need to know where Donkey Kong peeHHSHSS.

*through laughter* sorry this is... *breathe in* AHHHH 
 2020-06-25 16:22:25,588 - DEBUG - file running:  *cheerful music, slowly diminishing*

Is life quantifiable?

Every breath, every beat of a heart...

Do they count as tallies etched tirelessly into the stone of our existence,

until one day, that stone is returned to dust?

Is there a number, an algorithm, underlying the spark of life?

And if given the chance to know the arcane secrets of that algorithm,

would you use that power for good?

Or would you use it to calculate your pet’s HP?

Because that’s what I would do!

*energetic music*

HIT POINTS!

What are they and how did they become the standard unit of life in nearly every game?

It all started with war games, tabletop games that involve a lot of little miniature military

forces fighting on a battlefield.

Back in the 1920s, the Naval War College created an early form of this in order to help evaluate

battles before actually fighting them.

They had a stat called “Life” which was determined by how many

14-inch shell hits a vessel could take.

So that’s what a hit point is, how many 14-inch shells it would take to kill you.

Every living creature is one hit point.

The end.

But that isn’t our current understanding of HP.

That came when war games shrank in scope and started to become more fantasy oriented.

In older games, you would roll dice, and then your troops would either survive or they would die.

You had large swaths of nameless troops so you could do this without feeling any remorse

over their deaths.

Haha.

War.

But when these games stopped playing with hundreds of troops and instead focused on

a few main characters, players realized they didn’t want their characters to die!

So the hit point was born.

Your character could survive X number of bad rolls before throwing them in the garbage.

So really, the hit point wasn’t made to quantify how easy something is to kill,

it was born from compassion and wanting to see your characters grow and thrive.

And then also to figure out how easy they were to kill.

We’ve had some semblance of HP for nearly a century, but we haven’t updated our real-world

understanding of what one hit point looks like.

So I’ll be doing that, specifically so you can quantify your pet’s HP.

A little disclaimer up front:

I am not giving you this algorithm so you can battle your pets.

Animal abuse is wrong.

And if you needed me to tell you that...

I’m glad I told you that.

I'm also not teaching you how to calculate human HP, because that power is too great to wield,

and it could easily be used for evil by some of the most wicked forces on Earth...

like health insurance companies.

No, I am teaching you how to calculate your pet’s HP as a fun bonding exercise between

you and your animal, or in case you happen to be at a house party where you don’t know

anyone but the hosts have a dog and so instead of just sitting in the corner pretending to

text people, you can spend your time calculating that dog's HP, which is a way more normal

thing to do in a social situation.

Now it is time for the research.

How are we going to effectively calculate ANY pet’s HP?

Luckily, there are plenty of games that cover pretty much every type of pet that you could

possibly have, but I’ll be using Pokemon as the main pet HP analog because it is literally

about having lots and lots of pets that you can love and cherish

and I’m ignoring all the other stuff.

And that brings us to our first criteria: Type.

According to the National Pet Owners Survey, here are the most common types of pets found

in U.S. Households.

I appreciate that they have included a category called “Small Animals,”

as if that means fucking anything.

So we're changing some things.

The standards are still there: Dog, Cat, Fish (and all aquatic creatures), Reptile, Bird,

Equine, Small animal is becoming small mammal for things like ferrets and rabbits.

We're also including bug, because I love bugs!

And if you have bugs in your house and you make the conscious decision to WANT those bugs in your house,

they aren't pests,

they're pets...s.

Amphibian for the frog people.

Farm animals covers any livestock that don’t immediately fit into the other categories.

Originally, I thought about classifying these quadrupedal animals as different sorts of dog.

Chunky dog, milky dog, horny dog.

But farm animal encompasses them a little bit better.

I am still keeping those names, though.

We also have a category I call “exotic,” which encompasses all of the animals you see

in instagram influencer pics that make you say,

This can go from monkeys to bats to hyenas, which, according to this incredibly reliable

website, I could technically own in New York due to a loophole?

*about to make a terrible decision*

Also, Millennials and Gen Z often live in tiny, “no pet” apartments and

don’t get paid enough to support a decent standard of living for themselves, let alone

a pet, so they’ll often turn to plants in order to feel the joy that comes from nurturing

a living thing in our rapidly decaying ecosystem.

*sigh*

So I’m extending pet status to plants so that way you too can do this HP calculation,

because, god, we all need a distraction sometimes.

By building a set of pet types, we are able to assign HP RANGES to each of them by finding

the lowest base HP and highest max HP of each type.

The absolute extremes of this scale are Shedinja, with a base HP of 1, and Wailord, with a max HP of 544.

Now, both of these would be pretty wild to have as pets,

considering one is the shell left behind after a cicada molts,

and the other is a fucking whale.

But that’s why they’re the extremes, and that’s why we are not done with our equation yet.

We might know the full HP range of a dog, but what is the HP range of YOUR dog.

I thought for a moment about having size be the next criteria, because you might think

that the larger the animal, the more HP it would have.

But that’s actually not true!

In fact, the Pokemon with the highest base HP is Blissey, this strange little egg woman.

And Onix, an enormous rock snake, has one of the lowest base HPs of all Pokemon.

This confused me, so I had to go back to the original popularizer of HP: Dungeons & Dragons.

And it was there that I realized what truly affects your HP value:

Your value is not defined by the size or shape of your body,

it’s about what you do with the body you’re given.

*cheesy motivational music*

It’s all about class!

As in, what standard gaming class does your pet fall into?

Every class has different HP ranges based on what they are expected to do.

Barbarians are out in the front lines, so they tend to have a lot more HP than a rogue,

who is slinking around in the back.

I’ve decided that the classes that make the most sense for pets are: Barbarian, Ranger,

Paladin, Cleric, and Rogue.

I haven’t included any classes like sorcerer, because if you have a magical pet,

what are you doing here?

Go cast spells with your turtle.

These class distinctions separate your pet’s HP range into 10 equal portions.

If your pet is a rogue, you get the first six.

If your pet is a barbarian, you're anywhere from five to 10.

Your pet’s personality will determine what class they fall into.

Your pet is a rogue if they are rakish, mischievous, and spry.

Cats tend to come to mind for the rogue category, simply because they’re always up in shit

they should not be up in.

Your pet is a cleric if they are kind, reserved, and healing.

A rabbit that hops onto your lap after a rough day of work and makes you forget all your

worries is 100% cleric.

Your pet is a paladin if it is loyal, resourceful, and, honestly, tries a little bit too hard.

Does your zucchini plant produce too many zucchinis?

A.K.A.

Any amount of zucchinis?

It's a paladin.

Your pet is a ranger if they are self-sufficient, aloof, and kind of do their own thing.

Ask yourself, am I holding my pet rat back from their true ambitions?

The answer is always yes, and your rat is a ranger.

And finally your pet is a barbarian if they are boorish, brazen, and courageous to a fault.

Does your dog dig under the fence so it can jump into your neighbor’s pool?

Your dog is Marmaduke.

It is also a Barbarian.

Your pet can have a combination of many of these traits, but it’s up to you to decide

which traits are most dominant.

Now that we have your pet’s type and class designated, we need to get into the nitty

gritty of their exact HP, which means finding your pet's level.

In order to do this, you must observe your pet in a scientific manner.

So I reached out to field biologist.

Hi, I’m Olivia.

I'm a wildlife biologist.

I contacted Olivia after she responded to my totally normal twitter request with this

dope-ass picture.

I figured that if anyone knew how to calculate the hit points of an animal, it would be someone

holding a huge bird like it was a torch.

Have you ever found the hit points of any of the animals you've been researching?

I've never been involved in any sort of study where that was something that we looked at.

So no.

Okay.

But there are probably plenty of studies about hit points with animals.

Probably.

Though she didn’t have experience with my specific question, I knew she would have some

useful advice for observing animals in their natural habitat.

When you're observing an animal, how much interaction should you have with it?

None.

None.

At all.

None.

You have to sit in like a blind or a tent of some sort where you're hidden or you look

like part of the environment.

You could wear a ghillie suit.

Brian - Oh!

Olivia - People have also done that.

How long of a period are you observing that animal for?

It depends on how much time and resources you have, obviously.

There have been scientists that have been observing the same hawk for, like, 20 years in a row.

So if I'm trying to... perfectly know my pet's HP, I should be observing it for

multiple years.

Yes.

Cool.

How do you take notes when you're observing an animal.

Right, so, I actually—can I send you something?

Yes, please.

This is exactly what I was looking for.

Olivia had sent me an animal behavior data sheet, which I could use as a template for

observing and recording a pet’s behavior.

But some of these behaviors wouldn’t make sense when observing your pet on a random day.

We ended up developing a new sheet that had standard behaviors and class specific behaviors

that had different weights associated with them.

You observe your pet for X number of hours, tally up all the behaviors they did over the

course of those hours, and then divide the weighted total by X to give you your pet’s level.

The logic behind this is that a higher level pet is more likely to do more intense and

class specific behaviors.

Then you plug that level into this algorithm, and you get your pet’s HP.

It may seem challenging, but science shouldn’t be easy, it should be correct.

This is probably the hardest scientific work you've ever had to do.

It really is.

Yeah.

With these tips in mind, I welcome you into my home.

In order to test these calculations, I need a test subject.

So I’m using my roommate’s cat, Zuko!

He lives in my apartment but he doesn’t pay rent and he eats my bagels if I leave

them unattended.

As I mentioned previously, finding your pet's HP can be a fun bonding exercise, and in this

case, I’ve been dealing with this small bastard’s antics for so long, I need to

remind myself why he’s here by quantifying his value.

The first step is easy!

He is a cat.

That puts him in the cat category.

Okay.

Step two, we gotta give Zuko a class.

As I mentioned previously, cats are often rogues, but I don't think that fits Zuko considering

he’s the least stealthy creature I know.

His meow sounds like he’s been smoking two packs a day for the past forty years.

*incredibly raspy meow*

And every time he does manage to sneak into his food cabinet,

he lets me know immediately.

Just wanted to check in on what's going on up here in the cat cabinet where we keep all

of the food for the cat.

*loud crash*

He is loud, stubborn, and not afraid to make terrible decisions in plain

view of me.

And that makes this guy a Barbarian.

Okay!

But now it is time to observe Zuko to find his level.

As per Olivia’s instructions, I must observe him for several years without any interaction.

After explaining why I needed it, my time off request was denied.

So instead, I ate some bodega sushi in order to induce illness, and I took a sick day.

Mmmm.

This is the hard part, because it's going to require me to observe Zuko as he goes about

his daily business without him noticing that I am here at all.

I assumed my position, and I waited for the interesting behaviors to start.

*cheeky music plays*

Not only was this terribly boring, but I was beginning to fear that Zuko

was not as strong as I had hoped.

DO SOMETHING!

PLEASE!

But then I realized there was a exploit in my system.

Though Olivia, a scientist, said that you should keep your interferences to a minimum...

I’m not a scientist, I’m a gamer.

And I began what is known as power leveling.

I had to get Zuko as many experience points as I could before my roommate got home and

asked me what I was doing.

Over the course of the day, Zuko averaged 63 behavioral experience points per hour,

although those behaviors were somewhat coerced by me.

I know that I broke my system by interacting with Zuko, but if it makes my pet happier

and it makes him less of a weak-ass scrub, why wouldn’t I game the system!

I had also noticed that Zuko and I had grown closer, our support level had increased to

at least a B. I no longer saw him as a freeloader who sometimes throws up in my bed,

I saw him as a companion...

who sometimes throws up in my bed.

When I felt lonely in my empty apartment, he was there for me.

When my stomach ached from the bodega sushi, he purred at just the right frequency to ease my pain.

When I was worried he was going to be under leveled, he soothed my anxieties

with his heavenly voice.

*beautiful meow*

And all this time I had spent trying to calculate his HP,

I hadn't realized he was replenishing mine.

So here is Zuko, Barbarian class level 63.

I love him with all my heart, and he loves me just the same.

Ow!

Okay, okay...

*lots of wonderful meows*

Beautiful.

Psst!

Remember when I said I really wanted to play the Cyberpunk RPG?

We finally did it.

Come watch me play as a totally uncool forum moderator called Vang0Bang0.

Guys don't say other things, we should only have one person in the...

You're making it sound like there are more than one person in...

There's only one person in the bathroom! 
 2020-06-25 16:22:25,589 - DEBUG - file running:  *drum beat*

THE SIMS! While other games push you through the meticulously crafted story

of some hero, this game allows you to experience the joy that comes from crafting your friends and family

and then making them pee themselves in doorless rooms.

I’ve been playing The Sims since I was a kid, and it allowed me to imagine what I might become.

A successful doctor, perhaps, with a mansion

and a pool that doesn’t have a ladder to get out of it.

And now that I’m a D-list internet video producer with a grungy apartment in New York City,

I’ve realized that I was using The Sims as wish fulfillment.

Perhaps there’s a better way.

I might only have one life, but my Sim can live many, many lives.

I was playing a game.

I should have been doing an experiment.

So today, I’m going to use The Sims to perfect my living situation.

*music stops*

Oh what a surprise!

Now, this Unraveled will be a little bit different

considering most of it is going to be game footage, meaning...

I don’t need any paper!

Let me explain my methodology. We will have two subjects:

Simulated Brian, and reality Brian, which is me, I’m Reality Brian.

Here’s my hypothesis: If Simulated Brian’s living situation can be perfected in the Sims,

then Reality Brian’s living situation can also be perfected by altering it the same way in real life.

Now, I could try to do this in a “perfectly controlled environment,” but life is messy and sometimes

science has to be messy, too. So before I can create my Sim...

I gotta measure my apartment.

Obviously, I have to work with what I currently have. And if I’m supposed to make an honest

simulacrum of my living situation I gotta make sure it’s to scale.

I should also point out that I live in a three bedroom apartment with two roommates and a cat. And although

they have rooms of their own, I will not be modeling them in the Sims.

Partially because I rarely spend any time in their rooms, but it’s more because I am a good roommate

who respects personal boundaries. I will not redecorate their personal spaces.

But I will exploit the common space for content.

When you cut my roommates rooms, you can split my apartment into 6 different sections.

I used vanilla Sims 4, because I didn’t want Simulated Brian to accidentally become a wizard, or a skeleton,

or a college student.

The first step is to make an accurate depiction of myself, both in personality and in appearance.

This took a good chunk of time, but it was worth it when I crafted an exact 1 to 1 replica

of myself in the Sims. Then, I built the space. I used my measurements and gave myself close

to unlimited funds to create the apartment, and bought myself the cheapest appliances

just like my landlord did.

At the end of this, I had a pretty exact reproduction.

Then it was test time.

I gave myself a career similar to my own, and then I let Simulated Brian do his thing.

My rule was that I had to have little to no interaction.

But after a few days, it became clear that there were flaws with my experiment.

One, it was too slow.

If I want a longitudinal look at Simulated Brian’s living situation, I need to see his ENTIRE life.

Two, this experiment is meant to perfect my living situation, not my job.

And currently, Sim Brian is finding enough fulfillment in his career, which is an uncontrolled space.

Sim Brian needs to stay in his apartment, and that means no job.

Three, Sim Brian was perfectly content reading books,

and everyone knows that books are BORING!

So I obviously need to fix whatever personality flaw turned my Sim into a dweeb.

I addressed the first flaw by downloading a mod that would allow me to put on Ultra Fast Speed.

I also altered my sim's personality to reflect my own… and I accepted that Simulated Brian’s appearance

wasn’t all that accurate in the first trial, so I fixed that as well.

With the new personality traits and the ultra fast speed mod, this trial was far more accurate.

I spent a lot of time standing in my bathroom, staring at the wall, or sadly contemplating my reflection.

And then Sim Brian died of starvation after 4 days.

Which is a MASSIVE SUCCESS!

I got to see the entirety of my Sim's life!

In trial 3, I took a hands-off approach.

I popped on ultra fast speed, and I let it ride.

In this trial, I die of starvation after just 2 and a half days.

Which makes me think that this mod might be so fast that Sim Brian can’t feed himself.

So in trial 4, I start on normal fast speed,

and I decide I’ll only jump to lightspeed when I’m bored.

And things start well enough!

Sim Brian manages to socialize and stay happy for two days.

It starts to break down on Tuesday, when I find my sim

sadly eating a grilled cheese in his empty kitchen.

And then on Wednesday, Sim Brian sadly eats cereal while staring out the kitchen window.

Things get real bad at 2 am on Thursday,

when he stares in the mirror for hours.

The ennui has set in.

That afternoon, he stands in front of some dirty dishes on the coffee table,

too depressed to wash them in the sink, which is mere feet away.

Sim Brian goes through the same motions for the next week.

Watching TV. Staring in the mirror. Sleeping at random intervals. He seems devastatingly unhappy.

But he manages to live a much fuller life than the past two iterations!

It takes him nearly a week longer to die of starvation!

Except, he doesn’t really die.

In an effort to expedite the death sequence, I accidentally hit ultra fast speed,

and for some reason,

this killed death.

I waited, hoping the reaper would respawn, but no.

So I rushed through the days.

Waiting for someone to find my collapsed body in the weird corner of my creepy hallway,

but the only people who noticed my quote unquote "death"

were the utility companies.

I used this moment to look around my neighborhood.

Most houses were far nicer.

I was alone in a little box surrounded by neighbors who had forgotten me, or perhaps never knew I existed.

Even death had forgotten me.

I watched my slumped body linger in limbo as nothing changed.

After a week, I resigned myself to quitting.

And then in trial 5 I peed myself!

A LOT!

Boy, trial 5 exemplifies how much my apartment needs an upgrade.

At the beginning of the trial, my sim left the house to socialize.

And he was so happy not being in his tiny apartment that he stayed outside for 12 hours,

ignoring his bodily functions, and at 9pm, while speaking to a potential new friend,

he peed himself.

Does this make the embarrassed and uncomfortable Sim go inside?

NO.

Sim Brian so loathes his living space that he decides to stand outside all night browsing the internet,

until again, he pees himself right before having a flirty conversation with his friend Terri.

Dirty, dirty Terri.

After another full day outside,

hunger, exhaustion, and the need to pee FINALLY make Sim Brian go home.

He was more willing to spend two nights soaked in piss before spending a single minute inside his apartment.

Big Mood.

The rest of his life was typical. Mirror. Standing. Dying of starvation.

After 5 control trials, it was time for the results.

Here’s what I learned:

One, I’d rather spend time outside my house in repulsive conditions than spend time inside my house.

Something needs to change.

Two, the only thing that ever managed to make Sim Brian happy

was “good decoration.”

I need to redecorate.

And three, Sim Brian managed his basic needs until he became desolate due to a lack of social interaction.

A hole so deep he couldn’t go anywhere but down.

And this makes me believe that the thing that killed me was not starvation,

but rather becoming so lonely that I no longer sought to fix my situation.

But that has nothing to do with my apartment,

so let’s focus on the things we can change!

Simulated Brian was happiest in these terrible trials when the decorations were good,

and that’s something I can fix in real life.

But before I do, let’s set some ground rules:

One, I can't alter any of the rooms in my apartment, or I'd lose my security deposit.

Two, I can't change the furniture, because my roommates bought it, and then they’d hate me.

And three, the money. I had considered giving my sim a budget similar to my own,

but money cannot buy happiness.

And if this is true, then money, when compared to happiness, has no correlation.

Therefore, money is no object, and my sim should be allowed to purchase anything regardless of price.

Infinite money.

Sims decorations show how many environmental points they are worth.

By this logic, it doesn’t matter how well a room is decorated…

it matters how MUCH a room is decorated.

So I spent a solid hour giving my apartment the most decorations possible.

Allow me to give you a first person tour.

The Living Room now has lots of beautiful paintings.

The Weird Nook now has a purpose as The JAZZ Room, because for some reason,

the Sims has SO MANY JAZZ PAINTINGS.

The TV has to stay, but now I have three maps around it to say, “I’m also smart sometimes.”

The Kitchen hasn’t changed because it’s small and there’s no space to hang anything.

The creepiness of the hallway has crystallized into Sad Clowns.

No one wanted to spend much time in this hallway before,

and now they REALLY don’t want to.

In my room, a bunch of portraits, an apple wall, and a pear wall.

This should remind my sim to eat food.

And finally, in the bathroom, I installed a second mirror so I can’t just stare at the wall.

Now let’s see it in action.

In the first trial, I did another hands off approach on ultra fast speed,

and my sim once again died of starvation super quickly.

So, yeah, maybe the mod is too strong.

BUT! In trial 2, things go way better.

For the first time in any of the trials,

my sim manages to go from Very Sad to Happy, thanks to the tasteful decorations!

Though Sim Brian has moments of ennui and loneliness, for the most part, the house is making him happier.

Sim Brian does so well that he survives after the utilities shut off his power and water,

and he dies of starvation after more than two weeks.

That’s nearly DOUBLE the length of any of the other trials!

MY DECORATIONS WORKED!

Yeah, I still die of starvation, but I’m living TWICE AS LONG!

And that’s all the proof I need that this is the perfect form of my apartment.

All I gotta do now is make it in real life.

Polygon said that they wouldn’t reimburse me for purchasing thousands of dollars worth of paintings,

even though I TOLD them it would make me more productive,

so I gave myself a budget.

Then I went to a lot of thrift stores to purchase

as many paintings as I could find.

Some fit the aesthetic. Others would need alterations.

But I got a lot of things! Or, I thought I had, until I got home and realized

it wasn’t even going to cover one of my walls, let alone all six rooms.

So I dug around my apartment to find anything that could be stuck on the walls.

In the end, I was able to fill the entrance, but the rest of the living room was pretty sparse.

In the Jazz room I put up a papier mache man playing the piano, a dart board that felt pretty jazz to me,

and a skeleton wearing a tank top that says "I heart my Daddy,"

because...

I honestly didn’t know where else I could put that.

In my own room, I put up the appletini painting and

hung a huge self portrait from my senior year of high school.

And that was it.

That’s all I had in terms of decorations.

I took the day off to do this, but I was done in an hour.

I even put on my suit in order to film the results of the trial,

but my house felt as empty as it had when I began.

I couldn’t start the live experiment because I couldn’t recreate my sim’s house.

But I wasn’t giving up.

If I couldn’t purchase the decorations I needed, I figured I could make them myself.

So I bought a bunch of washable paint and 1000 feet of butcher paper.

“I don't need any paper!”

I lied.

It was a week before Thanksgiving. I was going to be out of town

and I needed to finish this part of the video before I left.

That meant I had to create about 70 large paintings in less than three days.

I got a solid start, painting all of the apples and pears.

I even managed to edit the two paintings I got from the thrift store into Sad Clowns.

But I was halfway through the second Sad Clown when this process started weighing on me.

If I had to spend a few hours on 10 of the simplest paintings,

there was no way I was gonna get this finished before deadline.

I was alone in an apartment making shitty paintings for a video that wasn’t gonna get made in time.

I got a stress migraine, so I turned off the camera, and I went to lie down.

When I woke up from that heinous nap,

I decided to do one of the most difficult things I’ve had to do for an Unraveled:

I asked for help.

And if you’ve never had to ask your friends and coworkers

to help you paint terrible paintings for a stupid video,

let me say you’re not missing out on much.

It’s an uncomfortable thing to ask people to do.

And honestly, the weirdest part of this whole process is that...

people said yes.

People said they'd come help me paint.

And, and they said yes just because they wanted to,

and also 'cause I said I’d buy pizza,

but you gotta grease the wheels somehow.

So I turned my house into a painting factory. I cut the paper. I moved the furniture.

And that night, people came over. Not just my roommate and my coworkers but my friends,

and friends of those friends.

I was expecting one or two people to help me, but I ended up with 10 people in my house,

all painting large scale portraits

and REALLY GOOD SAD CLOWNS.

Seriously, who knew that my friends were SO GOOD at painting sad clowns?

I don’t 100% know how to feel about how good my friends are at painting sad clowns,

but I'm glad I gave 'em an outlet.

All of these people came over just to make my apartment happier.

To lend a hand when I was overwhelmed.

And not only were they helping me make my apartment happier by decorating it,

they made it happier just by being there.

This task that had given me a stress migraine became a really fun time.

And it reminded me that, although it can sometimes feel uncomfortable or embarrassing,

if you ask for help, more often than not,

people are willing to help

you paint large pictures of jazz men.

In three hours, a task that seemed insurmountable by myself was complete.

And I was so excited that I did the walkthrough while they were all still there.

The Living room with fabulous landscapes,

The Jazz room’s huge murals.

The Creepy clown hallway that was way too good.

My room with its amazing portraits and fruit walls.

And the bathroom, where I stared at myself,

not considering my flaws or my apartment, but just smiling.

That’s it.

Just smiling.

It’s been well over two weeks since my apartment was redecorated,

which is longer than I survived in the Sims trials,

so it’s been an incredible success.

My apartment is perfected, I’m happier with it, and it’s all thanks to the redecoration.

Or at least, that’s part of it.

I think that part of the reason I find so much joy in my apartment is knowing

that the decorations were made by people I care about.

There’s a story behind it.

Simulated Brian fell further into sadness due to his isolation,

but the paint night turned Reality Brian’s terrible situation into something joyous.

So I have to wonder:

Does my newly perfected apartment make me happier because of the decorations,

or because of the people who helped me decorate it?

Trick question, it’s obviously the decorations.

JESUS! 
 2020-06-25 16:22:25,589 - DEBUG - file running:  Ah, the Elder Scrolls, games chock-full of lore.

And Skyrim is no different.

Hidden amongst the draugr and dragons is a plethora of books full of very important

and incredibly niche details.

But with all the spellcasting and shouting you must do as dragonborn, who really has

the time to read all those books.

I DO.

APPARENTLY.

I read every book in Skyrim in order to answer the eternal question, “Should you read every

book in Skyrim?”

And I’m here to give you my top five recommendations of books, here in my SKYRIM BOOK REPORT.

Skyrim book report!

How many books are there, really, in Skyrim?

After all, there are only eight people credited as writers on Skyrim.

Those eight people are responsible for every quest, every voice acting line, every response

you can give to an NPC.

How much time do they have to write all those other books?

A lot!

Because they wrote this many books.

This many books.

*pained grin*

Or at least they wrote most of them because a few of them have been grandfathered in from

other Elder Scrolls games.

Before I get into the nitty gritty, let me explain my process on how I did this Skyrim

Book Report.

I printed out every book in Skryim, and then I spent multiple eight-hour days reading EVERY.

SINGLE.

BOOK.

I whittled it down to 338 books because I didn’t include journals or diaries.

Everyone knows that self-published doesn’t count.

In total, that’s 571 pages, five and a half point font, over three hundred and sixteen

THOUSAND words.

I had two reactions to this.

My first reaction was, “Wow.”

This is an incredible amount of world building.

To write 300,000 words that could essentially be skipped over while still having the full

Skyrim experience, it’s amazing, and it’s a level of world building that could only

exist in an interactive medium.

And for that, I commend you, Bethesda.

My second reaction to this,

was WHAT THE FUCK.

HEY TODD?

WHAT THE FU-

In my Skyrim Book Report, I will be discussing:

*smack*

That’s a smash cut.

Hopefully.

If I do my editing correctly.

338 books.

Uh, actually, 337, I just realized, um, over here, Songs of Skyrim, I put both of them

in there, but there’s a revised edition.

I lied.

It’s just 337 books now.

Obviously, I don’t have time to synopsize all of these, and believe me, you wouldn’t

want to watch that even if I could.

I’ve split them into categories to make this a little bit easier.

First up, historical books!

These book titles you see rolling up the screen are all biographies or histories.

What I categorized as histories was anything that had big historical dates in them, explanatory

histories, or pretty much anything that was boring.

History’s so BORING.

UGHHHH.

J.R.R. Tolkien

*kiss*

did the world a disservice by making every single fantasy writer think

that they need to chronicle every goddamn minute of their world in order for it to be

legitimate.

I don’t give two shits about a king who lost a war 700 years ago.

*snoring noises* Get OUTTA here!

Some of these biographies are actually pretty interesting.

But a lot of them are written like The Chronicles of Nchuleft.

I didn’t tab it out ‘cause it’s a shitty story.

“It happened in Second Planting (P.D. 1220) that Lord Ihlendam, on a journey in the Western

Uplands, came to Nchuleft; and Protector Anchard and General Rkungthunch met him there, and

Dalen-Zanchu also came to the meeting.

They talked together long by themselves; but this only was known of their business, that

they were to be friends of each other.

They parted, and each went home to his own colony.”

RIVETING.

Ugh.

History’s so boring.

I’m done with this.

Next category: Instructional books!

These are all field guides or basic recipes about how to make good armor or what flowers

go in which potions.

At best, they are in-fiction instructional books.

At worst, they are so obviously trying to get you to go do specific things.

Pulls you right out of the fiction!

C’mon man.

That’s all I’m gonna say about that.

Everyone’s favorite: the academic books.

Fun fact about academic books that I learned in college

is that no one has ever enjoyed writing or reading an academic paper.

WHY’D YOU PUT IT IN A VIDEO GAME.

Mythicaaaaal stories.

It’s kind of weird to differentiate things between myth and history, especially in this

world where you can talk to demon princes.

I split these two up because these are very boring and these are slightly more palatable.

They’re more like creation myths, or they’re just like random stories that are fun to read,

so they’re getting closer to good fiction.

The poetic and dramatic.

Everyone knows that poetry and theatre are meant to be seen and not read.

And you have NO IDEA how much it pains me that I do not have time to do staged readings

of all these.

Oh my GOD I would have loved that.

We have “eh.”

What genre is “eh?”

It’s the catchall.

Um, these tend to be accounts, kind of like medieval fantasy op-eds.

So I…

I just put ‘em here.

EH!

We’re done with these now, so…

Get outta here!

Finally, we have 59 books that I would consider good fiction.

GooooOOOD fiction.

What I did here is I gave myself three criteria about what would make good fiction in the

realm of Skyrim.

Number one, does it help build the world around us?

Number two, does it give us an interesting or different perspective on that world?

And number three, is it good?

Now you might say, “Brian, what gives you the right to say what is good fiction?”

I READ ALL 338 YA DINGUS.

BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY THAT THESE WERE THE ONLY GOOD ONES.

THIS IS ALL I’M QUALIFIED TO DO NOW.

I need a drink.

*deep breath*

Okay!

There’s still 59 of these, so I obviously can’t summarize all of them, but I have

left five off, and they are my top five books of Skyrim.

So we’re gonna talk about those.

Number five, Advances in Lockpicking.

Now Advances in Lockpicking is actually an instructional book.

But I think it does more than just the other instructional books, where you open them up

and suddenly you’re better at lockpicking, because it’s written by a thief in a very

interesting voice.

There’s a great ending line for this book: “Some thieves can’t read.

If you can’t read, get someone to read this book to you.

It will make more sense then.”

That’s great.

I think that’s a much more fun way than saying, “Here is how you pick a lock.

This is what this set of armor is.”

Better than instructional.

Just good fiction.

Number four, Palla.

In a world where crazy creatures exist, how do you make fiction that is compelling that

people can just kind of experience in their own life.

Palla is a necromantic romantic book.

It’s a story about a man who sees this beautiful statue of a woman fighting a beast and falls

instantly in love with this woman.

Turns out, she’s dead!

From fighting that beast.

He decides to get into necromancy to bring her back from the dead.

I kind of don’t want to ruin the surprise for you.

It manages to tell an interesting story while also introducing these ideas of monsters and

necromancy.

It’s kind of weird, but it’s very well written.

I’m gonna go ahead and put up three and two.

Why do I put up the Argonian Account and Feyfolken at the same time?

Turns out, it’s written by the same fictional author: WAUGHIN JARTH.

This one’s for you, Waughin!

I’m a big Jarth head!

He’s not actually in the story at all, I couldn’t find any instance of, like, him

as an NPC.

So I really hope he’s in the next one.

Because I want to meet Waughin.

I just want to meet Waughin Jarth.

These ones were not actually written specifically for Skyrim.

They were grandfathered in.

But they do an incredible job of building the world around you.

The Argonian Account is actually the second story in a series all about Decumus Scotti.

This is kind of like the Hobbit of Tamriel, where we’re taking this unassuming character

and thrusting them into this completely foreign, amazing landscape, except instead of a hobbit,

it is a midlevel bureaucrat.

It’s full of screwball comedy and wonderful worldbuilding about the Black Marsh which

is where all the Argonians live.

You have to fast travel by being eaten alive by a worm.

That’s great.

I want to see that whenever we go to the Black Marsh.

It’s so flavorful, and that’s why I’m a Jarth head.

Feyfolken.

It’s a story about a scribe who’s terrible at his job but gets this enchanted quill that

forces him to be amazing.

Sends himself into this madness, and he kills himself at the end of the book, spoiler alert.

But that’s not what this story is really about.

It’s an interesting fiction that teaches you about different Daedric princes, and which

ones could have caused this specific enchantment on the quill.

That’s good worldbuilding!

I am interested in the story!

You told me something that I can learn about the world.

I had a good time reading Feyfolken!

Jarth, ya did it again!

And that leaves us with the number one book.

It’s not The Lusty Argonian Maid.

I feel like I should broach this subject.

I’ll tell you why I didn’t include it in my good fiction list,

and it’s not because I’m a prude, who doesn’t love a little erotic lizard fiction?

*OOH COME ON BABY*

The reason I didn’t include The Lusty Argonian Maid as one of the best

pieces of fiction is because it’s SEVEN ACTS LONG.

Seven acts?

There is no way you can manage to maintain that level of erotic tension for seven acts.

That’s like five and a half hours!

As a person who has done one or two plays in my life, that’s just unfeasible.

Okay?

I’d like to see them try.

~I would like to see them try~

*OOH COME ON BABY*

Before I go to number one, I gotta go

get a flu shot.

This is not a joke.

It’s important to get your flu shot.

Alright, I’m back.

The number one piece of fiction in Skyrim, not Waughin Jarth, I’m sorry.

It’s Beggar, Thief, Warrior, King.

It’s four books, actually.

But it’s all part of Eslaf Erol’s story.

It is completely fiction even within the fiction of Skyrim.

The reason I put it first is because it’s the only book that was legitimately hilarious.

I straight up chortled.

*chortle*

That’s what I did.

In real life.

That’s amazing.

The writing style of these four books is just naturally hilarious.

There are so many bland, cookie-cutter stories in Skyrim that follow the same set up, twist, punchline.

This doesn’t have that.

It’s just a good story.

One of these writers was just flexing, and I think that’s wonderful that a writer had

a chance to—within the fiction of Skyrim—write something that’s just naturally funny.

You should all go home, onto your computers, boot up Skyrim, find these four books, and

then read them, in order.

It’s worth it!

That’s my quest, for you in Skyrim.

300 gold points.

That’s it!

That’s it, that’s all of the books.

So like, what did I learn from reading all 338 books of Skyrim?

Surprisingly, a whole lot.

Like, there are two main takeaways that I pulled from this.

Number one, this is a masterclass on how to write effective flavor text.

Between all of these, historical, instructional, the good fiction, and, you know, the iffy fiction.

This is a way to learn what to do and what not to do.

Obviously, not everyone is going to connect with certain types of flavor text.

I’m sure there’s a lot of people that disagree with me and think that the historical

is the most important flavor text.

And you know what?

They are valid.

And they’re wrong.

And they always seem to find my comment sections.

When you take something good like Feyfolken which teaches you about the Daedric princes,

but in an interesting way, it really shines in comparison to the three and a half million

biographies of Barenziah.

You don’t even see them in Skyrim.

I don’t care about Barenziah.

IT’S BORIIIIIII-

But not like Feyfolken!

That’s really interesting and effective.

Also it just teaches you about all these wonderful forms of fiction.

If you’re a fiction teacher, like, teach your kids with Skyrim!

TEACH THE KIDS.

WITH SKYRIM.

I got a creative writing degree.

That’s all I have to say about that.

Second takeaway, this is a wonderful teaching device about unreliable narrators.

So many of these histories are negating other ones.

This is a wonderful way of showing people you need to read everything if you’re going

to get the whole picture.

I read everything.

I am the keeper of the picture.

That’s every book in Skyrim.

So it’s time for us to revisit that ever present question, “Should you read every

book in Skyrim?”

NO!

WHAT?

HOW COULD YOU WATCH THIS WHOLE 10+ MINUTE VIDEO AND THINK THAT I WOULD SAY ANYTH- WHAT?

NO!

I BORE THIS BURDEN!

FOR YOU!

DON’T READ THEM!

NO!

Please don’t read them all.

DON’T READ THEM!

You can read the top five, that’s fine.

GRRRRR.

HOW DARE YOU JETTISON MY GIFT!

DON’T READ THEM!

NOOOOOOOOOOO

screaming

This new Sonic has a lot of fans crying heresy.

Sonic should be that cute, blue, cartoon hedgehog that’s gotta go fast,

and that’s all he’s gotta do.

But what if I told you that this was not the only blasphemous version of Sonic

What if I told you that nearly every single piece of Sonic media was heretical

I hold in my hand 13 pages that prove just that.

Before I hop into the deep end, I need to explain a little about Sega, these 13 pages,

and how Sonic was made.

You see, Sega was in a real tough spot in the early ‘90s as it tried to compete with

Nintendo and the overwhelmingly successful Mario.

So they worked internally to create a new mascot.

Not just for a game, but for the company as a whole.

Naoto Ohshima created Mr. Needlemouse, a teal hedgehog with red sneakers.

And then he worked with Yuji Naka to create a game around this wonderful creature.

A few tweaks and Sonic the Hedgehog was born.

Or at least one version of Sonic was born.

You see, Sega wasn’t just fighting with Nintendo, it was also fighting with itself.

Sega of America and Sega of Japan had a lot of tension between them, and they didn’t

see eye to eye on a lot of things, especially when it came to Sonic.

The original version of Sonic was a bit more punk rock and had a girlfriend.

A real life human girlfriend named Madonna.

And we all know that Sega would never make Sonic kiss a real human woman.

discomfort

So Sega of America started to iron things out a little bit.

Make Sonic a bit more family friendly.

More marketable.

Madeline Schroeder, the self-described mother of Sonic, wrote out this 13-page bible that

set out Sonic's true origins.

These 13 pages went on to become the true Sonic.

The Sonic we all know and love.

Right

NOPE.

THIS BIBLE HAS HAD VERY LITTLE BEARING ON THE SERIES AS A WHOLE.

But here’s the thing, friends.

It should have a lot of bearing on the series as a whole.

And I am willing to wield this bible as a paladin wields a holy sword so that I might

EXCISE SIN OUT FROM THE SONIC CANON.

I'm sorry.

That was a lot.

I was a bit too intense for...

I'm gonna tone it down a little bit.

Folks, we’re about to engage in a friendly session of biblical literalism.

Now, I’m not one to advocate taking a written account as the pure truth and nothing but...

but for Sonic I’m willing to bend my values a little bit.

We're about to take everything written in these 13 pages as gospel, and anything that deviates

from the facts therein as sacrilege.

Let’s get Sonically Fundamental.

I’m not gonna read this bible in its entirety.

You can read it online if you'd like.

But I am going to read the first paragraph in full, because I think it's important for

you to understand what we’re dealing with.

“Sonny Hedgehog was born on Earth in the early 21st century, in the town of Hardly,

Nebraska, population 1,226.”

From the first line alone, we already know that

1. Sonic’s birth name is actually Sonny.

2. He is a real hedgehog that was born circa 2000.

And 3. He’s a midwestern boy.

“He and his mother and five sisters live underneath a scraggly hedge beside the local

burger joint, and subsist on burger scraps, milkshakes, and the occasional slug or bug

that crawls their way.

They are a poor but happy family.”

From these lines we know that

4. Sonic's family lives in an actual hedge, which is I guess why they're called hedgehogs.

And 5. They have a very similar diet to me.

“Unfortunately, Sonny’s dad died when Sonny was just a few days old, after falling

into a gurgling, festering vat of toxic waste dumped in a nearby pond.”

…

What

Sonic, the lighthearted hedgehog we all know and love.

Never knew his father because he was reduced to sludge thanks to corporate pollution.

There are 30 key tenets in the Sonic bible,

and I'm just gonna go ahead and list them off real quick.

just a big ol' mess of words from the Sonic bible

The 30 tenets of the Sonic the Hedgehog bible.

Look at 'em up there.

Beautiful.

Practically glowing with potential energy.

The potential energy I shall release into a HOLY FLAME, SO THAT I MIGHT BURN OUT THE

BLASPHEMY FROM SONIC'S MODERN ITERATIO...

Pat I think, uh, we should probably just take a couple minutes, just to, just to like...

Brian Okay.

Pat I'll... do you need water or anything

Brian Water... yeah, I think that'd be good.

Now, most of these are not found in most of the iterations of Sonic, but there are three

that specifically decanonize every game in the Sonic franchise.

Let's talk about 'em.

Number 18 There are seven chaos emeralds, one is a stabilizer.

You might have heard me say the name Kintobor.

He turns into Dr. Robotnik after he is fused the powers of the chaos emeralds and a hard-boiled egg.

Not a joke.

But he was originally looking for the chaos emeralds so that we he could bundle them up

and then launch them into space, thus reversing all pollution on the planet Earth.

The reason for that is because the Chaos Emeralds “contain a microlytic copy of all the inert

energy of every gross and disgusting impulse or deed done by humans since the beginning of time.”

Ignoring that microlytic is the name of a company and not an actual scientific term,

this seems to state that the chaos emeralds are just a crystalline form of every gross impulse.

Every time you pick your nose instead of using a tissue.

That’s in the emerald.

Every time you wear your underwear five times in a week 'cause you think it doesn't smell that bad.

That's in the emerald.

Every time you go three days without shampooing

I get it.

Look, sometimes, you know, the shampoo has sulfates and that can damage to your hair.

We all have different scalps.

BUT THAT'S IN THE EMERALD, TOO.

Most of the games just state the chaos emeralds are an incredible source of power, something

that will help you to take over the world or become Super Sonic.

They don't ever mention that they are essentially just garbage diamonds.

Had Sega included one piece of flavor text, like “You got a chaos emerald.

You should probably go wash your hands, now.”

Then it would’ve been fine.

But they didn’t.

Number 21 Kintobor was a father figure.

Just as a reminder, Sonic’s dad died in a vat

of toxic waste.

Which is why it meant so much when Kintobor offered him an assistantship.

“Sonny was thrilled at the prospect.

Because although Sonny had never known his father, Kintobor reminded him of the kind

face in the photograph.”

Heartbreaking.

Can you imagine the drama in this

Sega, you keep trying to do these gritty reboots of Sonic.

Sonic plus gun.

Sonic plus getting kissed by a human woman.

You don’t need all that.

It's all right here!

You are literally pitting Sonic, a hedgehog without a father, against the man who became

his father figure and then turned evil thanks to the machines that SONIC HELPED CREATE.

I hear you saying, “Brian, there’s no evidence that Sonic doesn’t think of Robotnik

as a father figure!”

And to that I say bullSHIT.

I have NEVER SEEN HIM CRY AFTER DEFEATING ROBOTNIK.

I HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM HOLD THE LIFELESS BODY OF HIS FATHER FIGURE AND SAY,

I am sorry it had to turn out like this!

I am sorry!

LET SONIC CRY OVER THE LOSS OF WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN, SEGA.

YOU COWARDS.

And finally, the third and most important tenet that destroys the entirety of the Sonic canon.

Number 11 Sonic helps quilters.

Have you ever seen Sonic in a quilting circle

Cause he should be there.

“While making the rounds for juicy tidbits and gossip, he would drop in on the ladies

of the local quilting circle to offer a convenient pin or needle from his ample, portable supply.”

WHERE IS MY SONIC GAME WITH A QUILTING CIRCLE

Sonic CD shitty.

Sonic Mania trash.

Sonic Hedgehog 2.

More like Sonic the Hedgehog Too MUCH OF A DUNCE TO INCLUDE TO THE QUILTING CIRCLE THAT

IS SO INTEGRAL TO SONIC'S BACKSTORY!

And with that, we have decanonized the entirety of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise.

But from this scorched earth can bloom a mighty flower.

The true Sonic the Hedgehog.

What would that video game look like

What are the ramifications of a Sonic the Hedgehog game based on the bible

The Sonic the Hedgehog bible.

Let’s go through this piece by piece.

We start the game with a legitimate hedgehog who lives in a hedge and his name is Sonny.

And it's 2019, and he's got brown quills, and they won't become blue until he gets faster.

And he eats food that is similar to the food that I eat.

He lives in Hardly, Nebraska, which is where the entire game is set, so you better get ready

for running in lots of corn fields.

His eyesight’s not good, but it’s okay cause he’ll get rec specs since he is able

to read but is also on the track team.

So the entire game is actually just running in track meets in the middle of a corn field.

When he’s not running track, he’s at the bowling alley or the playground or the quilting

circle doing normal hedgehog things.

The problem is that his town has SO MUCH POLLUTION, which is how his dad died, and it’s also

why Kintobor (now Robotnik), the trim kindly scientist who gave Sonic his new nickname

and the ability to speak the human tongue, was trying to solve with his new physics theories

and his machines and all of those terrible gross seven chaos emeralds before he became

evil and also a bit of an egg.

This is especially rough because Kintobor, before he became Robotnik, would feed Sonic

really good food and was basically a father figure to him.

Also Sonic is good at computer science.

So the game is basically an evil polluting scientist being taken down by a midwestern

teenage hedgehog track star with daddy issues.

So it’s basically if the CW rebooted Sonic.

Reach out to me, CW, I will license this.

But I haven’t used all 30 of these tenets.

See, there are four of them that, to be perfectly honest, shouldn’t be possible.

And beyond that, they are impossible to put into a game.

I've hit a bit of a roadblock.

Number seven shows Sonic's dead father winking at him through a picture on the wall, which

proves the existence of an afterlife in the Sonic Universe.

Number 15 shows that Sonic is able to hibernate below delta waves.

And those are the slowest possible brain waves.

About 0.5 hertz.

To go below them, Sonic would have probably died.

And yet he is resurrected and lives again.

And number 24, Sonic is shown to run at the speed of light.

And if the rules of relativity are to be believed, that means his mass would have to infinitely

expand, and he would need infinite energy to do this.

And that would destroy the world.

And yet he is able to do that without harming himself or those around him.

Number 30 is actually within the bible itself.

It states, “But like most peaceful times in the twenty-first century, it didn’t last long.”

This bible was written in 1991, nine years before the twenty-first century, and yet it

prophesied our challenging political landscape.

These four pieces of information are not purely canonical information.

They are...

divine miracles.

So of course I could not put them into a game.

They could only fit in a religion.

So I went on to wikiHow, the foremost explainer of how to do things, and I knew somewhere,

hidden in their beautiful imagery would be the way that I could spread the word of Sonic

to the masses.

And before you get upset with me, saying,

Brian, aren't you just starting a cult

Look at this question answered by Cutegirlcorr

Technically speaking, religions and cults are the same thing.

So I have formed my religion around Sonic the Hedgehog.

And guess what

I have a confession!

I'VE NEVER PLAYED A SONIC GAME.

NEVER IN MY LIFE.

I only tell you this now because you've already made it this far into the video,

and the sunk cost fallacy states that if you feel like you've invested something,

you're gonna see it through to the end.

But it's okay that I haven't played a Sonic game.

Because that means I haven't been tainted!

I have never beheld the false Sonic!

Only someone blind to the modern blasphemies of the Sonic franchise

could see as clearly as I!

Because if a hedgehog could commune with the dead,

be resurrected,

run with infinite energy,

and HAVE HIS GOSPEL PROPHECY THE FUTURE,

THEN EITHER SONIC IS A GOD

OR COULD KILL GOD

AND I DO NOT CARE IF THERE IS A DIFFERENCE!

Hello, friends, I’d like to take a moment now and apologize for my recent outburst.

I’ve taken some time and cooled down since filming this video, and though I suppose I

could have just not uploaded it to YouTube, I decided it would serve well as a cautionary tale.

You see, taking lore to be purely literal, whether that's for a video game or backstory

for a TV show, is a dangerous rabbit hole that can often lead to anger.

Biblical literalism is just an early form of fandom.

Sometimes, you gotta be a little bit more lenient.

Because sometimes, the bible was written to make a character

more marketable to kids in the '90s.

So let’s learn from this example, and make sure to take new additions to our favorite things in stride.

Even if it’s these legs.

I’m sorry, I can't in good conscience agree with that.

I do not agree with those legs.

I'm sorry.

I could spr... if you spray painted my legs blue, I could cosplay as this Sonic.

Do you think I should do that

Do you think I should spray paint my legs blue for a Sonic cosplay

Just half...

Just half, half down Sonic.

Not gonna do anything else to my body, just...

What are the ramifications of a Sonic the Hedgehog game based on the bible

everyone loses it 
 2020-06-25 16:22:25,590 - DEBUG - file running:  Stamina! That mysterious green juice that powers our muscles.

In video games, it allows characters to cleave dragons, climb volcanoes,

and lightly jog through a prairie.

I look at these heroic tasks, and I think…

How?

Look, I’m usually pretty high energy, but the fact of the matter is that

I’ve been stuck at home for the past two months

and I’ve cultivated the stamina of a cartoon basset hound.

I used to be so much more productive, and my energy has just completely vanished.

Is it because I’ve been having trouble adjusting to this new working-from-home lifestyle?

Or is it because my build is trash?

Today, I’m saying goodbye to that boring, languid Brian, and I am going to use the things I’ve learned

from video games to maximize my stamina.

*synth music*

I gotta go ham on these graphics ‘cause I don’t have a studio anymore.

There are two main ways that stamina is represented in video games:

stamina bars that automatically replenish, and stamina bars that don’t.

And these different representations lead to different techniques for boosting that stamina.

My hypothesis is that if I use these same stamina techniques in real life,

then I will finally have the energy to address laundry chair.

*Sad accordion music*

There are four methods of augmenting your stamina in video games.

Let’s start with the easiest one to understand. Item Refills.

You expend some energy, you eat something to replenish that energy. It's basic biology.

The Krebs cycle or something like that…

I am not interested, get that shit outta here.

The problem is that most video games are usually more fantastical than real life.

Oftentimes the item you need to consume is an elixir made from arcane magicks

siphoned from the very lifeblood that sustains our world.

Or, if you’re Hideo Kojima, it’s Monster Energy.

God bless you Death Stranding for having a magical canteen

that effortlessly turns dangerous Timefall into a branded energy drink.

You know, for a video game that loves to give you a 40-minute-long cutscene

explaining why some dipshit is named "HOTWETMAN" or whatever,

this piece of world building has a much simpler explanation:

MONEY.

And thanks to this shameless product placement, I have a concrete way to determine how to refill stamina.

Judging by Sam’s experience, it takes about 600 milliliters of Monster Energy to fully juice your bar.

And given the fact that this logic exists in a world where everyone is stuck in isolated homes

and delivery people are among the most important of essential workers,

I think it’s safe to say that conditions could not be better suited for this experiment.

The biggest difference between me and Sam Bridges is that I’m not getting paid by Monster Energy,

so I don’t have to pretend to like it.

Technique 2: Slowing Depletion.

Unlike item refills, this one asks you to do some planning.

You only consume one of these items before you have to do a huge task,

so it usually shows up in games where preparation is key,

like when you have to go fight a 40-ton pickle.

Monster Hunter has battles that can last upwards of an hour,

which can make the preparation as important, and as long, as the actual fight itself.

Kinda like eating a full pasta bake before the big track meet.

There are quite a few ways to slow stamina depletion in Monster Hunter,

but sometimes the simplest option is the best one,

and in this case, the simplest option is steak.

Steak is made from raw meat in Monster Hunter

— and also the real world —

and if you eat it, it boosts your max stamina.

But the effects change based on how you cook it.

A rare steak refills your stamina bar and makes it longer,

but a well-done steak does all that AND it slows your max stamina depletion.

The steak snobs among you may turn up your nose at the assertion

that a well-done meat is better than a wet, juicy, rare one…

But I posit to you this question:

Which one would you rather have jangling around in your leather satchel?

So I’ll be cooking these meats until they are all-the-way gray.

Technique 3: Stamina Regeneration.

With this technique, every time you use stamina, you’ll get it back faster.

And there is no game that makes you say,

“come on refill come on come ON COME ON COME ON REFI-”

more than Dark Souls.

In Dark Souls you consume stamina every time you attack, block, run, parry, roll, backstep,

backstab, ripost, jump, shoot arrows, call your mom, check your bank account…

And if you’re in the middle of a boss fight and you have run out of the stamina necessary

to dodge roll or swing your big sword,

well, them’s the breaks, kid.

Luckily, there are some accessories that speed up that stamina regeneration.

And even more luckily, you can purchase legitimate versions of these items for about... 300 bucks.

Uh, no thank you. I can make that at home.

And even if I did have the means to purchase these official props,

there’s still one massive problem.

The in-game items are imbued with dark, abyssal magicks

that I simply do not have the arcane wisdom to conjure.

Luckily, I do have one little piece of magic I can use.

It’s called: The placebo effect!

There are plenty of psych studies that show that clothing choices

can have an effect on our mood and your confidence,

and there are even more studies that show that placebos can have legitimate beneficial effects,

so why wouldn’t donning The Mask of the Child help me deal with laundry chair?

*More sad accordion music*

And finally, technique 4: Permanent Increases.

This is by far the best way to maximize your stamina.

When you’ve got all the stamina in the world, even the heaviest of tasks won’t phase you.

There are plenty of realistic games that use this technique, like Red Dead Redemption 2,

where the only way to increase your max stamina is to do a bunch of stamina heavy tasks, like sprinting.

But the thing about this technique is that…

IT SUCKS.

UH, I’M SORRY?! You’re telling me that in order to have more energy,

I have to use up all the little energy I have? That’s recursive logic.

I don’t have any energy to begin with, and you want me to run a mile? Bullshit!

So since Rockstar doesn’t actually care about realism, let’s talk about a more grounded game:

Breath of the Wild.

In this game, Link can trade four spirit orbs to increase his hearts or his stamina.

But I want to focus on this little guy, the Horned Statue.

Here, you can do a different sort of trade… a devil’s bargain. You can increase your max stamina...

YOU JUST HAVE TO GIVE UP SOME LIFE.

The only problem is that I can't figure out how I would gain more stamina

by doing something physically detrimental, like using a shampoo with sulfates.

I would never do that.

So for now, I’ll be focusing on the first three techniques.

Here’s how the experiment will go: I will spend one day on each technique,

rating my stamina level every hour of that day.

If I’m at a 0, then I’m either sleeping or dead, so most of my stamina levels will be between 1 and 10,

with a 1 being the stamina level of a hotboxed sloth,

and a 10 being the energy of a 6-year-old at a laser tag party who just finished his first can of mello yello.

My goal is to be at a level 10 at all times.

I’ll also be rating the boosts based on three criteria: Boost speed, Boost endurance, and Boost Quality.

But first, we have to do a control trial. Which is just a normal day.

“Just after 7 o'clock on a Monday. I'd say my power level is at a 5. I'm about to have some coffee."

I went about my day as I normally do, which is to say, boringly.

If we take a look at this graph, you’ll see that there were two little spikes.

The first one, which happened after I had my morning coffee,

and the second one after I hit a real low spot right after lunch.

I have no idea if I’m pointing to the right places.

“It's half past one. I decided to be productive by at least leaving my house.

Gonna go buy a liter of Monster.

You can't tell because I'm wearing a mask, but I'm grimacing under here."

This is obviously just one control trial,

but it is emblematic of the lethargy I’ve been feeling for the past few weeks.

I never got above an 8, and in fact my average for the full day

was just a little bit higher than how I was feeling right after I woke up. That’s pretty bad.

But it means there's nowhere to go but up.

And I’ll be going WAY UP with the first technique trial.

“Feeling about a 5, not super tired, not super energetic.

But instead of making coffee, I instead will go and take a swig from my canteen,

which I have filled up with three different Monster Energy drinks, up to the liter mark.

If I'm at halfway through my stamina right now, I should be drinking 300 milliliters. Let's see if this kicks in!"

And the effects of Sam Bridges’ favorite concoction did, indeed, kick in. "8 o'clock!

Let's, okay, obviously the energy drink has, uh, affected me. Let me put this down so I

can move around with my hands. I can still have more stamina. Yeah, I feel like I'm at

an 8 right now. You know normally I'd say that that's fine. I'm trying to be at the

peak performance level. Another 120 milliliters down the hatch. Let's do some work, baby!

*singing* Don't mind me, just gonna do some work right now. Feeling fine! Probably a 9.

Or maybe a 9 and a half! Maybe a 10? Probably... I'll, mmm, 9 and a half. Can we get waffle

fries? Does anyone deliver waffle fries? NO FILMING! Let's go write more scripts!" Things

were going great for me in the stamina department. Until they weren’t. *incoherent mumbling*

"The crash, and then right after eating lunch has kind of... just brought the whole thing

down to a 3. Now that I have seen that Monster gives me a super high and then immediately

crashes me, I’m going to do the only thing a sane person would do, and consume more monster

energy. Let's go to work!” And though I went searching for that magnificent, full

stamina feeling I fleetingly experienced in that morning, I still averaged less than the

control trial for the rest of the afternoon. I drank 3 full cans of Monster Energy.

“If I hadn’t had the monster energy, would I have been dead right now? I don't understand.”

There was only one little spike that happened after I had to go outside to pick up steaks

for the next day’s trials, and though the energy drinks didn’t keep me up all night,

there were some other side effects, that ultimately led to a bad review of this technique. “My

body is tired, but my mind is just, there's some anxieties in there? And also I feel,

like, physically not great." Still I had high hopes for Trial 2. Since the previous two

trials trended downward, I had hoped that Slowing Depletion would help. Unfortunately,

due to the previous day’s trials, I was operating at a deficit. "Went to bed alright

and then I woke up about 2 hours after that, and then kept waking up every 30 minutes.

I'll tell you what, more than anything in the world, what I would love to do is go ahead

and brew myself a pot of coffee, but you know what, I’ll do you one better.

Super cheap, beef eye-round steak.

I’m gonna ahead and grill one of these puppies up to a healthy 160 degrees Fahrenheit.

Let’s get some breakfast going.”

I tried my best to go into this experience unbiased, and honestly, the first steak of the day wasn’t that bad.

“I feel more powerful."

And though it didn’t give me quite the same bump as the Monster Energy,

my stamina levels rose and stayed level for the entire morning.

“It feels like I'm maintaining it a lot better.

Maybe I really am not degrading my stamina. It is almost lunchtime.

Maybe I'll eat two well-done medallions of steak."

That’s exactly what I did. Sadly, the second meats of the day were not as wonderful,

and this is where the true challenge of this technique came in.

“I do really wish I was eating something other than this.

The problem is that I'm still very hungry, and... but I also don't want to eat any more well-done steaks.”

With my stomach rumbling and my stamina flagging, I decided to try to take my mind off it by

working on the accessories for the next day’s trials. And this did give me a little stamina boost,

and that stamina maintained, but other things weren’t going so hot.

“Great, stamina’s going alright, but I am so hungry,

and also so upset with idea that I have to eat more of these well-done pucks of meat.

But I'm gonna make the last two!

Now a lot of you might be wondering, doesn’t it get easier over time?

And the answer is obviously no.”

By the end of the day, it's easy to see that though my stamina didn't get quite as high,

it did last longer, so there might be some truth to this slowing degradation technique.

But unlike the Monster Energy trial,

this one was both literally and metaphorically harder to swallow.

There’s a reason energy drinks aren’t chewable.

Luckily, our final trial didn’t make me consume anything.

“I slept a little bit better last night, at least, so I'd say I'm at, like, a 4.

But the goodnews is that I know just what to do. Let me go put on my accessories.

I already feel energized.”

Okay, full disclosure, as much as I believe video game logic,

I did just tape some tin foil onto some cardboard.

I wasn’t expecting much from this trial.

But the results speak for themselves.

“Why don’t I carry around a shield more often!

This makes me feel so powerful!”

I had a morning boost that rivaled Item Refills!

Sure, working in full garb was a little bit annoying,

but that didn’t stop me from being an active participant in my virtual meetings.

"Yeah, I can, I can help out with that, Jenna, if you need any extra help on that one."

Jenna - "Yeah, Brian. I guess so."

But around 11, the mask and shield were getting to me,

so I started altering which of the accessories I was wearing.

There’s no set bonus, so as long as I have one item equipped,

my stamina regeneration should be a little bit faster than normal.

“For the past hour, I took off the mask, and I’ve just been living on the Chloranthy Ring.

I do feel more tired. I'm gonna rethink about the mask."

At 1:30, I had to do a stream, and I did that in the mask.

And sure enough, my stamina was boosted after that experience.

In fact for most of the day, the accessories helped and didn’t make my stomach hurt,

but there were other costs.

“I don’t like wearing this mask.

I feel like my stamina has increased. But it seems like there's an obvious trade off going on here,

because, like, it's not, it’s not comfortable to wear. You can see, like, it's been squishing my nose.

I’m deciding whether or not I want to have higher energy levels or if I want to feel comfortable,

is really what's happening at the moment."

Take a look right there.

I imagine that the Wright Brothers wore a similar expression the day they went to Kitty Hawk,

because that is the face of a man who is ready to soar.

Remember how I said I couldn’t figure out how to trade health for stamina?

Well judging from these previous trials,

each one of them was physically detrimental in a specific and wonderful way.

"I feel, like, physically not great."

"Why am I still so hungry?"

"It's not comfortable to wear."

Perhaps I could trade my health for more stamina by doing every technique at once.

Welcome to The Final Trial!

“Waking up this morning and realizing what I was going to have to do today

really just made me not want to get out of bed.

I am about to do all three stamina things at once.

I’m not expecting it to feel good, but I am expecting

an increase in productivity unlike... anyone has ever seen from me.”

So after donning my outfit and grilling up a well-done steak,

I sat down for breakfast.

“God I hate this steak.”

And by 9 o’clock, I felt the effects.

“I think maybe god didn’t intend for us to wake up and drink an energy drink

and eat a well-done steak and then wear a tin foil mask.

I’m at a 5.”

Okay, so the boost didn’t happen right away,

but let’s remember that some of these boosts take a while to warm up.

And given the fact that I'm increasing my max stamina,

I should be hitting a 10, maybe an 11 or 12, by midmorning.

Except things didn’t change.

“It's 10 o'clock and I'm still at a 5. What the hell?

I'm just gonna cook all the steaks, I'm gonna drink all the energy drink, I'm gonna wear this while I'm doing it.

I'm just gonna do it all right now. I'm tired of this. I'm also physically tired."

I ate four steaks.

I drank all of the rest of my energy drink.

I was GOING to increase my maximum stamina.

“I’m ready to take on the day.”

*pained moan*

It turns out that doing every single stamina boosting technique at once fills your stamina bar so full,

that the bar explodes.

I felt physically ill and had to lie down for several hours.

I can’t even review this boost technique because it just knocked me unconscious.

But I will say that I did rebound later that day.

“So I left my house.

Came out here to take a little walk while maintaining adequate social distance.

I feel... I feel a WHOLE lot better.

You can't tell, but I'm smiling under this."

And this made me rethink some of my trials.

Most of my afternoon boosts weren’t due to gimmicky ingestibles, they were because I took a small walk,

or I did a fun craft, or I talked to my friends online.

Was I doing these techniques for nothing?

Is video game logic wrong?

No.

I just didn't understand what video games were teaching me.

Getting good at Dark Souls or Monster Hunter is about knowing how many swings of your big sword

you can do before you need to take a break.

It only becomes a major issue if you completely run out, and you have to spend a few seconds staggered,

or spend a few hours lying in bed.

Maybe the real stamina technique I need to learn is recognizing that, right now,

I may not be able to do as much as I want to.

But if I focus on the little wins,

I can manage my stamina, and I can manage my expectations for my stamina.

So although I may still wear the Chloranthy Ring, it will just be for the fashion.

And today, I’m gonna take care of laundry chair.

You tell me when the camera stops rolling so I can stop folding.

*SYNTH BANGER* 
 2020-06-25 16:22:25,590 - DEBUG - file running:  WALUIGI.

The tall bastard man that Nintendo loves to disrespect. We know he's number one.

But who really is he? And where did he come from?

And why hasn’t Nintendo given him his own game.

The cult following of Waluigi cannot be overstated. He is an icon.

The patron saint of weird content creators.

But isn’t it strange that this character so beloved by Nintendo fans

seems to be completely disregarded by the company?

I don’t believe that’s actually the truth.

Nintendo cares almost too much about their characters.

They rarely put a character into a game unless they're 100% sure it’s a good fit.

And I think this is the reason why Waluigi has been sidelined:

Nintendo doesn’t know what Waluigi is all about.

So, Doug Bowser, I have collected every single piece of Waluigi lore into this one

simple video, and I’ll be presenting it to you, so you can finally make that Waluigi game.

Wahaha!

That was my first attempt, I'll get better.

In order to understand Waluigi perfectly,

we have to take a look at every appearance he's made in a Nintendo game.

They’re the only ones that count toward canon.

If you'd like me to discuss Waluigi's noncanonical appearances, I can definitely do that for you, Doug,

it'll just have to be in my off hours

because it is DEFINITELY not safe for work.

Here’s every Waluigi appearance sorted by release date.

These 63 games contain the entirety of Waluigi’s characterization.

He is playable in 50 of them, and we can split those playable games into Sports and Party Games.

I combed through each of these appearances, grasping at any piece of Waluigi characterization,

but the vast majority of them treat Waluigi as a meat puppet. A space filler.

An extra body on the character select screen. And, honestly, that’s one way to see Waluigi.

I hear you, Doug Bowser. Why should I care about a space filler character?

Well, you already care about a space filler character.

A little fella named Mario.

Let’s discuss Waluigi’s counterparts to shed some light on his origin.

The original Donkey Kong was supposed to have Popeye characters, but Nintendo couldn’t get the license,

so Shigeru Miyamoto created an unnamed player character as a stand in.

And that space filler was later named Mario.

People think that characters have to have some deep backstory in order for people

to like them, but that’s NOT TRUE. People love Mario BECAUSE of his humble origins.

The same cannot be said about the rightfully despised coward boy that is Luigi.

You see, Luigi was made because they needed a player 2 in the game, so they just palette swapped Mario.

That is a character filling a space by copying another filled space.

As much as I hate to admit it, I will have to revisit Luigi later in this video,

because he is key to developing the personality of Waluigi, and that's partially because of Wario.

Wario wasn’t made by Miyamoto. Supposedly, the team behind Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins

didn’t enjoy being forced to make a Mario game because they didn’t create the character.

So Hiroji Kiyotake created a bad Mario, someone that had all of Mario's evils exaggerated.

And finally, we have Waluigi, who was created by the same character designer who worked on Golden Sun.

The guy who made Saturos and Isaac and all of these intense powerful characters

used his talents to make the most intense, most powerful character.

And he made him for a very important reason:

because Wario didn’t have a doubles partner in Mario Tennis.

If Wario is just the evil exaggerated form of Mario, then Waluigi's the same for Luigi.

And that’s really all we get from Waluigi’s first encounter.

That, and the fact that Luigi is not afraid of him.

*Mario Tennis music plays*

"Luigi not afraid."

Luigi, the milksop who is afraid of all, is not afraid of his evil, funhouse mirror twin.

There’s something to that, but I don't know if I can quite grasp it without discussing all of the lore first.

So let’s switch back here.

As I mentioned before the tangent, Waluigi often plays the role of meat puppet,

so not all of these games have lore that is useful to us in developing a Waluigi game.

So I’ll take them off the board.

After cutting, we're left with 5 references to Waluigi, 7 party games, and 13 sports games.

From these 25 appearances, we can take all the juicy morsels and put them into a list of Waluigi Truths.

Let’s start with the references.

Though Super Smash has notoriously snubbed our large purple child,

the trophies do a pretty good job of fleshing out his character.

Super Smash Bros. Melee lays out 8 Waluigi Truths in just three sentences:

Four things right there: Tall. Thin. Evil looking. “Seems” to be Luigi’s rival.

That one isn’t really definitive, so we’ll keep it ambiguous.

Waluigi is a mischief maker, and he takes it seriously.

Luigi is exactly the same age as Waluigi, and I do not know who that reflects worse on.

Also, I love that Waluigi is connected to Wario, but no one's ever cared to take a closer look.

Are they friends, accomplices,

lovers?

It’s unclear!

The next Smash games really hammer home these truths,

only adding that he must also have a crooked mustache, a large nose, and a love of kicking.

Hmm.

*crashing noise*

The final reference comes from Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle,

where a large rabbid called Bwaluigi appears.

This is the closest Waluigi has ever come to appearing in a plot-based Mario game.

A fucking rabbid has had more screen time than the original Waluigi.

What can we learn from this?

As we move onto the party games, a lot of Waluigi’s lore is reiterated.

The main additions are that he is a misanthrope who loves to party.

There are two strange pieces of info in the party games.

In Mario Party 5, each pairing gets a different team name, and Mario plus Waluigi are “Psuedo Bros.”

Not enemies.

It seems like Mario is okay working with Waluigi instead of Luigi.

The second weird piece of info is in Mario Party 4, where Waluigi is described with the quote:

“That Waluigi's a serious sneak! Watch out for his Sparky Sticker..."

This quote doesn’t have any useful info for us, but the phrase “watch out for his sparky sticker”

is the worst and I hate it and why’d you put it in a family friendly video game, Nintendo?

Finally, we have the Sports games, where Waluigi started.

Mario Tennis set the tone for Waluigi with two truths.

One, that he’s highly skilled as a technique player. And two, that Luigi is not afraid of him.

This one's still weird to me.

These ones all have quotes that reiterate what we know about Waluigi.

He's hardworking and he's skilled, even if he cheats sometimes.

We have some metaphysical characterization in Super Mario Strikers, where the legend states

“Waluigi's ego tends to be his biggest enemy.”

In Mario Hoops 3-on-3, his Baller Name is “The Question.”

Which I think just solidifies him as an enigma.

Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games shows that Waluigi is a great jumper,

and Waluigi’s special move in Mario Super Sluggers is the Liar Ball, which is a ball that

he splits into two copies, one real and one false,

which emphasizes his mischievousness.

In Mario Power Tennis, there is a blooper reel where Waluigi is aware that this is all a show.

Does this mean that Waluigi is able to break the fourth wall,

or does it prove what I already knew,

that Waluigi is great on camera.

It's hot under these lights, anyone else hot in here? I'm just gonna pop this bad boy off if that's okay.

*crashing sound*

And in Mario Tennis: Power Tour, Waluigi appears without Wario.

Their relationship was never clear, but it is surprising that Waluigi, who was built to be Wario’s tennis partner,

can appear in a tennis game without him.

Luigi’s still there. Why can’t Waluigi exist without Luigi, save us all a headache.

And that’s basically all of the Waluigi lore you can learn from the games. The 23 Waluigi Truths.

And you can use them to create a Waluigi video game.

And I could stop this video here, Doug,

but I’ll tell you what, I'll do you a favor.

I'll tell you what I think the Waluigi game should look like, since I’ve done the research for ya.

If you’re gonna make a Waluigi game, you're gonna need to make it distinct.

Nintendo does a great job of tying gameplay to what makes a character special.

Mario’s got platformers locked. Wario has eccentric greedy microgames.

Luigi...

you know what, let’s actually go through Luigi’s truths and see how it led to Luigi’s Mansion.

Luigi is foolish, he's a coward, he's weak, he's pitiful.

And you take these truths and you think, hmmm, what kind of setting would allow this mistake of

a human to really exhibit his uselessness?

A haunted house!

This man has been bamboozled into comedic haunted house entrapment three times,

something most Hollywood stooges have only been duped into once.

He’s a big dumb idiot, and I would HATE to be associated with him.

But Waluigi is Luigi’s twisted reflection, so his game will be far removed from this numpty.

Let’s make it.

First, we're gonna move the truths that are physical traits to the side, since they're baked into Waluigi.

Next we have to decide on a cast of characters.

Honestly, Waluigi has been sidelined for so long that this needs to be a solo mission.

Now, let’s talk about the rest of these truths.

If you were to separate them out, you could probably make dozens of different games.

A mischievous prank game. A, uh, game where Waluigi gets schwasty every night.

And I’m not opposed to these games, but Waluigi contains multitudes.

Why does he turn to mischief? Why does he work so hard only to be cast aside by society?

Who is this enigma of a man, whose true enemy is himself?

The Waluigi game, like the man,

should be a mystery.

Nintendo already has wonderful mystery games, but they’re too cute.

Waluigi is raw. He's real. To convey the complex emotions of a complex man,

we can’t rely on traditional animation styles.

The Waluigi video game

should be Full Motion Video.

Doug, I know this is a wild concept. Nintendo is not known for live action video mysteries,

but Waluigi is just the intellectual property to explore this new genre.

Imagine Waluigi as a hard-nosed investigator, struggling to pick apart the pieces of who he is.

A man solving himself.

I mean, there is the issue of casting.

You gotta find someone who’s evil looking, and has a crooked mustache,

and a big nose and is great at jumping.

And, you know, that's a... that's a hard task to find one guy who's got all those features, you know, I...

Well now, wait a second, Doug.

If you take a look at my truths, you'll find that they're nearly the same as Waluigi's.

I’m hard working, I’m a bit of a scamp, and though I might not be as tall and lean,

there’s enough of me that WANTS to be Waluigi that I’d devote everything to being him.

I need this role, Doug.

I’ve spent the past few months devising this pitch for you. No one wants this more,

cares more about Waluigi than I do.

I will fight Charles Martinet for this role.

Is that what you want, Doug?

YOU PICK THE WEAPONS.

I WILL END HIS CAREER.

And that’s why I hope you’ll consider me for Waluigi’s Currently Untitled Full Motion Video Game.

But there’s something that's still nagging at me.

I’m sure you noticed that I didn’t address all of these Waluigi truths.

Why does every single quote state that Waluigi "thinks” he’s Luigi’s rival?

You could read this as Waluigi not being important enough for Luigi to consider him as a rival,

but why go through the trouble of putting that in EVERY SINGLE description?

Why not just make their rivalry canon?

And the fact that Luigi is not afraid of him is mind boggling.

Luigi’s personality is 90% fear and 10% being green.

Mario is shocked when Waluigi appears, and yet Luigi is calm,

like he somehow expected him.

And if Waluigi thinks his biggest rival is Luigi, then how can his actual biggest enemy be his ego?

Does that make Luigi the ego to Waluigi's id? A-a-and if...

"You can't have a Waluigi without a Luigi." "He splits into two copies, one real and one false."

"Pseudo Bros. Not enemies." "Why can't Waluigi exist without Luigi?"

Luigi and Waluigi are the same person.

*Vesti la Giubba starts playing*

It’s so simple. Luigi is just manifesting his own repressed desires as an alternate personality,

a shocking twist that no one's ever done in media before.

Waluigi is just the exaggerated form of Luigi’s deepest desires.

The want to be skilled. The want to be respected.

The want to PARTY.

Waluigi is everything Luigi wishes he could be but could never be

under the famous gaze of his famous brother.

What an amazing twist. What an amazing truth.

What an amazing role for me as Waluigi.

Think of the accolades, the game awards, the respect.

As someone who wished to be Waluigi for so many years!

As someone... who wished...

If there are two personalities, am I number one, or am I the one who is longing?

Oh god. I'm not a Waluigi.

I’m a Luigi.

No no no... Nonononononono!

*mirror shatters*

*shaver buzzes*

And that’s just ONE potential ending to Waluigi’s Currently Untitled Full Motion Video Game.

If you’re interested in licensing the idea, Doug, feel free to reach out to my agent,

and we can get filming tomorrow.

Or in like… five months 'cause I am gonna have to grow the mustache back-

I probably shouldn't have shaved it before we...

You know what, I don't have an agent, so just don't contact me.

I don't want to play Luigi, so.

Pat- "Can you sob while doing it?" Brian - "Okay."

*sobbing while shaving*

Pat - "Head back."

*Brian gags and coughs* *Jenna and Pat laugh*

Brian - It's so hard to sob while shaving because it gets in your mouth. 
 2020-06-25 16:22:25,591 - DEBUG - file running:  I love the Legend of Zelda series.

But the canonical timeline doesn’t make any sense!

Perhaps it would make more sense if someone tried to put every single piece of Zelda media,

canonical and noncanonical, into one timeline.

Someone should try to do that.

Let’s go!

Let’s start with the canonical timeline.

So we’ve got Skyward Sword at the very beginning.

Created Demise, and then he becomes Ganon later on.

Link gets resurrected.

It’s Minish Cap.

It introduces Vaati.

He’s a wind sorcerer.

And then he also shows up in Four Swords.

That comes next.

After Four Swords, Vaati is sealed, Ganon’s back, baby!

And it’s Ocarina of Time.

So Ocarina of Time splits into three different timelines here.

In one of them, Link decides to stay an adult, Ganondorf gets resurrected, and Link is nowhere

to be found.

And where’s Link?

Where’s Link?

I’ll get to it, don’t worry, I’ll get to it.

And then the whole world floods, and we get Wind Waker.

This one I’ll call “Adult Link.”

In this one, he decides to stay a child, the sacred realm is sealed, he’s finished his

entire meaning of existence by the time he’s like 12, and so he goes and does Majora’s

Mask, which is also very existential.

And then over here, Nintendo decided to make a timeline where Link loses.

Link just can’t do it in this one.

Ganondorf does whatever the hell he wants to, and now it’s A Link to the Past.

One of my friends invited me over to watch him beat Ocarina of Time, because he was really

close to finishing it, and then I went over and then he couldn’t do it, and so then

we decided to go outside and play basketball.

This is that timeline.

So we have “Adult Link,” “Child Link,” “Basketball.”

Let’s go back to “Adult Link.”

After Wind Waker, he just goes and hangs out with pirate friends in Phantom Hourglass.

We go to Spirit Tracks.

This is on a different island, and technically there is Link and Zelda, except Link is really

into trains now.

Let’s do the child one!

We go from Majora’s Mask into what is canonically called the Era of Twilight.

Obviously, it’s Twilight Princess next.

Then it gets a little bit darker and goes into the Age of Shadow.

We do Four Swords Adventures, which is different from Four Swords.

One has Adventures in the title.

Here’s some issues with canon over here in “Basketball” timeline.

In the Hyrule Historia, which came out in 2011, it states that next should be Oracle

of Seasons and Oracle of Ages, but the Japanese Zelda website technically states that it goes

Link to the Past, Link’s Awakening now.

So they’ve reversed those two.

So even the canonical timeline isn’t, like, super hard set-in-stone canonical, which goes

to show that it sucks.

He does this thing and then he goes sailing and then he crashes and has a dream and then

dies in the ocean.

I’m gonna keep Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages tied together right now.

A new Link, new cycle, and he goes A Link Between Worlds.

And then it’s another existential crisis, but this is my favorite one because instead

of having an existential crisis and then going to have to save the world from a moon, or

having an existential crisis and hanging out with pirates, he just gets really into fashion

in Tri Force Heroes, which is what I plan to do in my midlife crisis.

It’s The Legend of Zelda, the first one!

Zelda II: The Adventure of Link.

This is the same Link between these two.

A cult wants to resurrect Ganon or something.

We’re at the most recent game, and the most recent in the timeline, it’s Breath of the Wild.

You might be wondering, where does Breath of the Wild fall?

In which timeline?

Is it “Basketball,” is it “Child,” or is it “Adult?”

Well guess what: IT’S ALL THREE.

NINTENDO COULDN’T FIGURE IT OUT, SO THEY DECIDED TO JUST PUT IT IN ALL OF THE TIMELINES.

WHICH ISN’T HOW TIME WORKS…

TO MY KNOWLEDGE.

*vague gesturing*

I’m gonna make this timeline much worse, but I’m gonna also explain the convergence.

So what I’m gonna go to next is Zelda spinoff games.

I’m not gonna talk about some specific things, namely cameos, or when you can buy Link’s

clothing in other games, or some of the mangas because they’re just the same exact stories

as some of the main canonical timeline games.

I’ve wrapped all of these up.

Some of them don’t have connections yet.

Don’t worry, I’ll get to it.

Let’s start with the easy Zelda spinoffs.

There were a lot of them during Twilight Princess.

Link was also learning how to use his crossbow for big game hunting, and also it was Twilight

Princess Picross.

Midna wanted to… she thought picross would help him…

beat Zant.

We’ll start from the beginning.

Skyward Sword was supposed to be the first one, but they’re wrong.

Hylia chose her first hero, there was, like, a lot of time between the first hero and the

one that happened in Skyward Sword, and in that time was the Zelda Game & Watch.

Just like in Skyward Sword, there was an upper level and a bottom level, and then there were

dragons also in Skyward Sword.

That’s my logic behind this one.

You say “Zelda Game & Watch, what about the Zelda Game Watch?”

That’s right, the Nelsonic Zelda Game Watch.

This was a watch that you could play Zelda on, and there were only four dragons in this one.

Why?

Because the other Link already defeated the other ones!

There were three other dragons in Skyward Sword, and they were nice because they learned

that Link would fuck their shit up!

Link: The Faces of Evil and Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon.

I’m not an expert on this one because I’ve never played them.

Which I think is probably the best decision I’ve made in my life.

Right over here, why?

Because in Link: The Faces of Evil he has to go to the island of Koridai.

Islands?

In the great sea!

Obviously, that’s where they make sense to go.

Uh, Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon can go there, too.

SQUADALA!

But that’s not the only CD-i game!

There’s also Zelda’s Adventure.

Ganon, I guess he stole some celestial something-or-others, and then it started the era of darkness.

And remember what I said before about how it went to twilight and then to shadow?

What comes after that?

That’s right it’s darkness, baby!

Y’all know about the Satellaview?

It was a weird thing for the SNES, or the Super Famicom because it was just in Japan.

It insisted on all of the Satellaview games including the letters BS.

BS The Legend of Zelda: Kamigami no Triforce was just basically A Link to the Past, so

I didn’t include it in this one.

But there are other BS Legend of Zelda games, and they’re weird because they don’t actually

include Link.

They include these two characters that you could choose, and they technically part of

the Satellaview thing, so it wasn’t Link who was there, but… um…

I’ll explain in a second.

I cut one of the titles in half.

Clayton, we have to start over.

A Link to the Past happens and then Link goes away on a journey into the water and then

he dies.

What’s happening while Link goes on adventures is BS The Legend of Zelda.

It happens after that, during Link’s Awakening, when Link runs away, which is why those kids

are the ones in this.

And then after that it goes Link…

The Legend of Zelda: Ancient Stone Tablets.

And technically, since those kids are the ones that are in BS The Legend of Zelda, that

technically means that they are an iteration of Link, and so BS-X: The Story of the Town

Whose Name Was Stolen, which was a game that included those protagonists, but, um, didn’t

include anything about Zelda, technically is still a Zelda game, so I included it in

this one.

Barcode Battler II, you had to scan cards with a barcode and then you would have to

battle those enemies using it.

A different retelling of the same story as A Link to the Past, just like looking at it

from a different camera angle.

Tingle exists in actually two different timelines, and he also exists in every timeline, because

Tingle is, um, the perfect evolution of humanity.

He shows up in Majora’s Mask first, and he also shows up in Wind Waker.

We have an origin story for Tingle in Freshly Picked Tingle’s Rosy Rupeeland.

He starts to get the taste *mwah* I love rupees.

And then he starts selling his maps to you in Majora’s Mask, but at the same time as

Rosy Rupeeland is the Dekisugi Tingle Pack, which was, uh, DSiWare, and it just basically

was like a calculator, and like a fortune teller or something.

Tingle’s Balloon Fight DS.

This happens at the same time as Wind Waker.

Over here in “Basketball” timeline, we’ve got Ripened Tingle’s Balloon Trip of Love.

I’m not gonna explain how it connects just yet, because I’ll do that later.

It’s the final Zelda spinoff.

Hyrule Warriors Definitive Edition, and I’m using the definitive edition because that’s

just the collection of all of them, ‘cause there’s three different versions of this game.

I’m gonna put Hyrule Warriors over here, and I’m gonna call this the TIME BREAK.

*THE TIME BREAK*

They made three timelines already, so why can’t I make my own?

Hyrule Warriors is the second most important game in the entire timeline for how it ties

everything together.

Hyrule Warriors.

Think about that, Nintendo!

You made me care about Hyrule Warriors!

But we’re not done with Zelda games.

We’re gonna talk about Zelda character appearances.

If Miyamoto doesn’t, like, email me after this video goes up and say, “Brian, you’ve

cracked the code!”

I’m never gonna play another Zelda game ever again.

This whole goddamn suit is so tight, I feel like a Christmas ham.

I haven’t connected these two right now, because in “Adult Link” timeline, Link

just kinda slacks off, ‘cause he has, again, existential crisis.

He finished beating Ganon, what does he do for the rest of his life?

I’ll tell you what he does: He go-karts, and he fights people…

FOR SPORT.

Super Smash Bros. the original one, Mario Kart 8, and Soulcalibur II.

Got nothing better to do, might as well go have fun, and you know what, I respect that,

but you did forget that Ganondorf got resurrected, and then the whole world flooded.

So that’s on your conscience.

I imagine that Link still has, like, access to the Temple of Time, which is why in Super

Smash Bros. Melee, it happens simultaneously in Ocarina of Time, because he can change

himself into Young Link, and also Ganondorf’s there, and I don’t know why he’s allowed

to fight.

I’ve put these three Super Smash Bros. after Hyrule Warriors in the TIME BREAK.

*TIME BREAK*

And while we’re hanging out in the time break…

Sonic’s here.

Sonic’s in the time break baby!

I swear to god I’m not just using the time break as a catch-all, but it does work as

a catch-all.

There’s this weird-ass game for the Wii called Captain Rainbow.

Technically happens at the same time as Link’s Awakening because it includes Crazy Tracy,

but Link’s Awakening happens within Link’s dream, so that means that Captain Rainbow

might be happening within Crazy Tracy’s dream.

So it’s very much like Inception.

And that means that Joseph Gordon Levitt exists in the Zelda timeline.

That’s a joke.

Joseph Gordon Levitt doesn’t exist in any timeline.

And these are also gonna come down here next to Ripened Tingle’s Balloon Trip of Love.

WarioWare, all of them, and then Scribblenauts Unlimited.

And again, I will explain that later.

Phew, I’m getting too worked up about this.

Canonical games, spin-offs, Zelda appearances in other games, what’s left?

Every other type of media.

I swear to god if I get one “well actually…” comment.

That’s a lost cause, right?

Let’s start with books.

I mentioned before that Skyward Sword was not the first game and that Game & Watch was

the first game.

But it’s not the first instance of Zelda and Link.

Himekawa’s Skyward Sword manga does include the origin of literally… it’s like the

first Avatar, it’s the first Link, first Hylian chosen hero.

First instance of Link.

I really don’t know why Nintendo hasn’t included the choose-your-own-adventure books

because they love to have things that have confusing timelines where Link could potentially

die in them, like in “Basketball” over there.

The Crystal Trap and The Shadow Prince happen canonically after the original Legend of Zelda

and Zelda II.

There are, like, 11 or 12 or 18 different endings.

Stick with me here: you could win The Shadow Prince with high points or you could win The

Shadow Prince with lower points.

Those are two separate timelines in my head.

So low points from The Shadow Prince, you go to the Valiant Comics, and now we’re

gonna talk about TV.

If you win with high points, we go into The Legend of Zelda TV Series.

“Aren’t I sweet?”

After The Legend of Zelda TV Series, Captain N happens, and it’s weird because in this

one, the hero is a guy named Kevin.

He gets sucked into a television.

Captain N creates this potential option of being able to summon yourself into the game,

which explains THESE THREE THINGS.

I TOLD YOU I WOULD EXPLAIN THEM LATER!

Ripened Tingle’s Balloon Trip of Love starts with a dumb 35-year-old man who lives in his

parents’ house and then he gets sucked into a book, and then he goes into Tingle’s land

and he becomes Tingle.

WarioWare shows that the Zelda games exist at the same time which is in Captain N, and

also Scribblenauts Unlimited is here, too!

I haven’t necessarily figured that one out.

Board games!

There are Zelda board games, and they also deserve to be in the timeline.

The Legend of Zelda board game…

The Zelda board game happens if you die in The Crystal Trap, how does that sound?

Alright?

You happy?

But what about Zelda Clue?

That’s…

I guess, happens, uh, during the Super Smash Bros. time, right?

Because they’re having fun together, hanging out.

Zelda Chess!

*exasperated look at the camera*

There’s no plotline in Zelda Chess.

Put it in Ocarina of Time like everything else in this dumbass timeline.

Let me double check that I’ve gotten everything…

But what about the TIME BREAK?

*TIME BREAK*

I told you that I would explain the time break, didn’t I?

And I’m gonna explain it right now.

Why does no one understand the time break except for me, Brian David Gilbert?

Why am I the only scholar in time break studies?

I’ll tell you why.

Hyrule Warriors Definitive Edition happens outside of the timeline entirely, similarly

to Breath of the Wild.

It exists in all of the timelines because Ganondorf’s soul gets split into multiple

pieces that go into different timelines, and again, that’s in the story itself.

Link figures out that there are multiple timelines in this time.

And then he defeats the thing and he goes into existential crisis mode, just like over

here, and like over here, and like over there.

But what does he do when he knows that all of these timelines exist?

He goes and plays Super Smash Bros. with all of his friends in every single timeline.

That’s how Super Smash Bros.

Ultimate can exist, because it’s everyone, all the time, everywhere, and also Sonic!

But the time break still doesn’t fit in.

It’s still by itself over here, right?

Okay, the time break doesn’t have a space.

Link knows about every timeline, and he’s done hanging out with his friends here in

the time break, so what does he do?

He decides to settle down, get a real job.

And what can he do better than anyone else?

That’s right, he knows every location in every timeline.

I’m talking location, location, location.

HE GETS HIS REAL ESTATE LICENSE.

He buys up every land, he consolidates every timeline and pushes it all into one space.

How does he do it?

LEGEND OF ZELDA MONOPOLY.

THE MOST IMPORTANT LEGEND OF ZELDA GAME OF ALL TIME.

THE ONE THAT MAKES BREATH OF THE WILD MAKE SENSE.

REGGIE: TAKE FUCKING NOTES.

I JUST SAVED YOUR ASS WITH MONOPOLY.

THIS IS THE PIN THAT HOLDS THE ENTIRE ZELDA TIMELINE TOGETHER.

YOU MADE ME USE MONOPOLY!

That’s the entire Zelda timeline, including 55 pieces

of Zelda media.

Don’t ask me to do this again.
